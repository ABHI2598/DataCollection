The first technique exploits multiple detections in the same time-on-target and the second one exploits the fact that the radar antenna mechanical scanning impresses an amplitude modulation on the signals backscattered by the target. Performances of the two estimators are numerically investigated through Monte Carlo simulation and compared in terms of root-mean-square-error (RMSE), probability of detection and probability of target splitting, the latter being defined as the probability of detecting more than one target when instead only one is present in the cell under test. Numerical results show that the AML estimator generally outperforms the classical MW estimator, also in terms of robustness to target splitting.", "references": [], "authors": [{"country": null, "city": null, "name": "M.

In this paper, the geometry of arbitrary bistatic airborne radar configuration is firstly analysed, and a formula for Doppler frequency calculation with the variables of azimuth angle and bistatic range is deduced, which is an efficient tool for bistatic clutter analysis. Because of the severe clutter range dependence, the processing of compensation is indispensable in space time adaptive processing (STAP).

To solve this problem, a range ambiguity resolving approach is further proposed by utilising azimuth elements in phased array.

The relationship between parameters of the SF radar and the ghost images is provided analytically. A new synthetic range profiling algorithm is developed to generate HRR profiles without ghost images by using the least-squares (LS) estimation.

Specifically, the aim is the automatic recognition of ship targets from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images. For this purpose a new two-step multi-feature based technique is proposed; this technique uses a number of features extracted from the ship radar image and matches these features with those extracted from the images obtained by properly projecting the target models of the classification library. Both cases of a priori known or unknown ship aspect angles are considered: the knowledge of the ship aspect (as available from tracking data) allows the selection of the candidate models on the basis of the matching between the ship and the model length, thus resulting in a performance improvement. Moreover, both single- and multi-frame-based processing techniques are proposed in order to assess the performance improvement achievable when an increasing number of ISAR images are involved in the decision; the fusion strategy adopted for the exploitation of the information from the multiple images is also described.

In this study, live data was recorded by a high dynamic range multi-channel digital receiver connected to a two-dimensional (L-shaped) antenna array, and signals from an uncooperative HF over-the-horizon (OTH) radar transmitter have been captured and analysed. As a preliminary step towards the development of a general HF-OTH passive radar system, the scope of this work is to compare the performance of conventional and adaptive spatial processing techniques in terms of their ability to cancel direct-wave interference and protect useful signal echoes to detect a small cooperative aircraft target. In particular, an alternative adaptive beamforming method specifically tailored to this application is proposed, and its practical performance is compared with classical and standard adaptive beamforming approaches. GPS data measured on-board the cooperative aircraft provided accurate ground truth of the flight path, enabling target profiles in bi-static range, Doppler frequency and direction-of-arrival (azimuth/elevation) to be calculated as a function of time.

However, the CFA non-planar geometry induces clutter non-stationarity, resulting in elevated signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) loss when applying conventional space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms. Non-stationary clutter leads to covariance matrix estimation error and, consequently, an erroneous STAP frequency response. In this study, the authors examine two practical conformal antenna configurations: a belly-mounted canoe and a nose-mounted, chined shape. Using high-fidelity signal models, the authors show traditional STAP losses in excess of 10-dB because of the effects of clutter non-stationarity. The authors then investigate a number of ameliorating techniques compatible with standard STAP implementation, including localised processing, localised processing with time-varying weights, equivalent uniform linear array transformation, angle-Doppler warping and higher-order angle-Doppler warping. The authors demonstrate very good performance for the higher-order angle-Doppler warping method applied to the chined radome shape, with peak adaptive SINR losses reduced from nearly 16-dB for the uncompensated case to 3-dB of loss consistent with performance attainable in a homogeneous clutter environment. The authors also find good performance for three-dimensional angle-Doppler warping over azimuth, elevation and Doppler when applied to the tapered canoe shape, with uncompensated losses of roughly 14-dB reduced to 3-dB, again a level compatible with STAP applied in a homogeneous clutter environment. The authors thus show that CFA STAP can yield performance similar to that of a conventional planar array when using appropriate compensation methods.", "references": [], "authors": [{"country": null, "city": null, "name": "R.K.

The latter is referred to as geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). The best achievable accuracy for the coherent case is obtained, and a comparative study with the non-coherent case is presented. MIMO radar systems with coherent processing are shown to benefit from a gain because of coherent processing among sensors. This gain is referred to as coherent localisation gain, and it is proportional to the ratio of the signal carrier frequency to the effective bandwidth (a large ratio for typical signals). The footprint of multiple transmit/receive sensors results in a gain, referred to as MIMO gain, for both processing techniques. The MIMO gain is proportional to the product of the number of transmitting and receiving sensors. Analysis of the MIMO gain through the use of GDOP contour maps demonstrate the achievable accuracy at various target locations for a given layout of sensors.", "references": [], "authors": [{"country": null, "city": null, "name": "H.

However, the problem of position finding in passive radar systems is somewhat different from the general case of sensor networks. Generally, in a passive radar system, there are few receivers located at short distances when compared with the it distance from the target. In this case, a problem known as geometric dilution of precision (GDP) occurs, which considerably increases the error of many proposed methods. This phenomenon can even make the position finding equations non-solvable. Regarding this fact, we have developed a least mean square error (LMSE) based method, which uses both the angle of arrival (AOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements to estimate almost precisely the position of very distant targets in a passive radar system. A simple equation is derived here to compare the TDOA and AOA accuracies. Then, it is shown that whenever the accuracies of these two measurements are comparable, the proposed method estimates the target position more precisely than the conventional AOA-only and TDOA-only methods.

After a short introduction to the MIMO radar technique (a technique which is not new; the RIAS developed by ONERA was probably the first MIMO radar), explores two different applications are explored. The first application aims at improving the resolution and accuracy of a coastal radar, proposed here in a bistatic configuration. Such a radar operates with a wide sparse frequency band and with an equivalent wide aperture, taking advantage of the MIMO configuration.

An advantage of the technique is the use of standard Fourier-based analysis. This makes it possible to use of simple functions for global radar imaging. Although the imaging is accomplished by way of the phased array radars, beamforming is not necessary with the proposed technique.", "references": [], "authors": [{"country": null, "city": null, "name": "A.

Radar offers privacy and non-intrusive monitoring capabilities. Micro-Doppler signatures are typically employed for radar-based human motion detections and classifications. Proper time-frequency signal representation is, therefore, required from which important features can be extracted.

Additionally, an integrity monitoring preprocessing algorithm is provided that demonstrates a possibility of faulty measurements mitigation for conventional methods such as <i>K-</i>nearest-neighbour. This is achieved by detecting and excluding faulty measurements prior to classification.

Two variants of pre-processing algorithms are presented in the study, one for the envelope and the other for the phase. Both variants are based on the use the local variance filtering. The results obtained prove the sufficient improvement in a signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). Estimation of the marine target length under the low SCR is designed using the assumption of known or previously estimated velocity. Presented results demonstrate high accuracy of length estimation. Considered steps of targets detection and target attributes evaluations are necessary for maritime targets classification. The designed algorithms are verified using a set of experimental records of signals from different marine targets obtained using marine FSR developed by the teams from University of Birmingham, UK and Sofia University, Bulgaria.", "references": [], "authors": [{"country": null, "city": null, "name": "Hristo Kabakchiev", "affiliation": "Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski, Bulgaria", "university": null}, {"country": null, "city": null, "name": "Vera Behar", "affiliation": "Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgaria", "university": null}, {"country": null, "city": null, "name": "Ivan Garvanov", "affiliation": "University of Library Studies and Information Technologies, Bulgaria", "university": null}, {"country": null, "city": null, "name": "Dorina Kabakchieva", "affiliation": "University of National and World Economy, Bulgaria", "university": null}, {"country": null, "city": null, "name": "Liam Daniel", "affiliation": "University of Birmingham, UK", "university": null}, {"country": null, "city": null, "name": "Kalin Kabakchiev", "affiliation": "University of Birmingham, UK", "university": null}, {"country": null, "city": null, "name": "Marina Gashinova", "affiliation": "University of Birmingham, UK", "university": null}, {"country": null, "city": null, "name": "Mikhail Cherniakov", "affiliation": "University of Birmingham, UK", "university": null}], "publisher": "IET", "citations": [], "Metrics": {"Downloads (6 weeks) ": null, "Downloads (cumulative)": null, "Downloads (12 months)": null, "Citation Count": null}, "title": "Experimental verification of maritime target parameter evaluation in forward scatter maritime radar", "arnumber": "7070507"}, "Article 8": {"doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2014.0163", "keywords": [{"type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing", "kwd": ["signal processing", "receivers"]}, {"type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing", "kwd": ["I/Q imbalance compensation", "digital wideband receiver signal processing technique", "I/Q channel-based receivers", "sampling timing offset", "multiple Nyquist zone coverage"]}], "abstract": "A digital wideband receiver signal processing technique using two I/Q channel-based receivers with a sampling timing offset is proposed.

Global positioning system (GPS) is a very useful and cost-effective tool to determine PWV continuously in all weather conditions.

Based on the classification result, a new scheme is proposed to increase the robustness of current estimation. This involves automatically adjusting the first threshold that is used for obtaining an initial guess of the current velocity in the iterative LS method. The proposed wave algorithm directly uses the classified fundamental and first-order harmonic wave components for wave spectra and parameter retrieval. Unlike previous wave analysis techniques in which a bandpass filter is required to eliminate the non-wave contributions after the current velocity is obtained, the proposed algorithm simplifies the wave retrieval without such a bandpass filter.

The proposed code acquisition architecture provides a lower operation count for correlation with reduced memory consumption. Firstly, the memory in CI and the shift register in the correlator are integrated by changing the operation sequence of CI and correlation. Thus, half of the memory in CI can be removed, and the shift register becomes the sharing buffer for both correlation and CI. Secondly, the addition count in the correlation is reduced by combining a parallel differential matched filter (PDMF) with a two-dimensional (2D) architecture to form a memory-based 2D-PDMF correlator.

On the other hand, the sparse OTHR signal will introduce serious grating-lobes in conventional Doppler analysis methods and thus degrade the performance of target detection. In this study, an integrate clutter and target spectrum reconstruction method for sparse OTHR signal are proposed. The proposed method contains two aspects. First, based on the sparse basis representation, a transient interference excision method is developed, which uses time-frequency modulated rectangle window basis to represent the OTHR signal in a sparse way to identify transient interferences. The second aspect lies in that, based on the compressive sensing, a spectrum reconstruction method is proposed to obtain the integrate clutter and target spectrum with sparse samples.

This study presents the problem of sensor fusion of OTHR and a set of forward-based receivers (FBRs) for online mode identification of OTHR echoes, estimation of virtual ionospheric heights and localisation improvement. This fusion problem faces two challenges. The first is 'multi-path', as a kind of uncertainty existing in both the forward propagation of FBRs and the forward/backward propagation of OTHR. The other is 'coupling', representing the complexity that the mode/parameter identification and estimation couple each other. Here the joint optimisation scheme of identification and estimation is proposed mainly including four sub-processes: coordinate mapping with target height, joint identification and estimation of FBRs, mode identification of OTHR and localisation improvement. The simulation shows that propagation/clutter modes can be identified effectively and ionospheric heights are estimated without the help of ionosondes.

In this study, a novel unambiguous BOC tracking technique, the double phase estimator (DPE), is designed to account for the effect of signal bandlimiting. The DPE is an effective alternative to the double estimator (DE) tracking technique where the subcarrier lock loop is replaced by a subcarrier phase lock loop. In the presence of signal bandlimiting, the DPE is able to generate local signal replicas matched in a better manner to the input components, outperforming the DE. The performance of the DPE is thoroughly characterised and the processing of real wideband BOC signals is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed.

Although the vector tracking aided by a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) is not as good as the one aided by high-grade IMU in the tracking performance and stability, the low-cost IMU based vector tracking loop has lower price, smaller size and lighter weight. Hence, it is valuable to reduce the expense of ultra-tight integration system. In this paper, an ultra-tight integration system using the low-cost IMU based vector tracking is proposed to achieve the vector tracking and navigation for high dynamic applications. As the critical factor in the ultra-tight integration, the Doppler frequency shift is estimated and compensated to achieve the acquisition and tracking of every satellite. Then, a vector tracking Kalman filter is designed to implement the vector tracking and integrated navigation.

First, a decorrelated scheme is introduced and a pseudo non-linear process equation is reconstructed in which the corresponding pseudo process noise is no longer cross-correlated with the observation noise; so a celebrated non-linear filter, that is, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) can be used to filter the non-linear problem.

From the results of the simulation, the theoretical statements are validated, and some interesting but not surprising phenomena are also founded, that is, the performance of the conventional filter actually does not degenerate, whereas that of the proposed filters become better when cross-correlation exists and increases.

This 'all-weather' system is able to provide slant-range - Doppler images of non-cooperative targets whose motion is unknown. Conventional ISAR systems are designed for imaging targets with a direct line of sight of sensors. For this reason, they have a reduced performance in today's complex scenarios - such as urban environments - where secondary returned waveforms are added to directly reflected echoes coming from targets. They are known as ghost artefacts since they obscure true targets when using the standard range-Doppler algorithm (RDA). In this study, an innovative multipath mitigation technique is presented, in which 'time reversal (TR)' concept is implemented in ISAR images, leading to 'TRISAR algorithm'. For this purpose, a pre-processing algorithm is previously needed so as to solve the geometric problem related to multipath. Finally, superresolution algorithms provide us with the tools to mitigate the spurious component that arises during the averaging process carried out by TR-ISAR.

However, the performance of beamforming techniques utilising antenna arrays severely degrades in dealing with correlated and coherent multipath components which cause signal cancellation phenomenon and temporal correlation matrix rank deficiency. This study proposes a two-stage beamformer to jointly deal with interference and multipath signals.

To solve these computational problems, a variety of techniques have been studied, and the adaptive interacting multiple model has shown the best result. However, predefined sub-models with different conditions for multiple models are required. Moreover, the acceleration intervals for different acceleration levels should be determined in advance. To alleviate these problems, the authors propose a multiple-structured smart tracking algorithm which properly separates the acceleration from the overall noise by fuzzy c-means clustering.

A SAR image generated with a noise SAR suffers from the masking effect which is tied to residual random fluctuations in noise radar response from bright scatterers in the scene. This is similar to the masking effect present in the deterministic waveform SAR when the signal sidelobes of echoes from bright scatterers may mask the main response from a weaker target. The procedure presented is a variation of the CLEAN algorithm. Knowing precisely the emitted signal and finding positions of the strongest scatterers one may model the echo signal originated from a selected scatterer. Extraction of the modelled signal from the received one reduces the residual fluctuations and makes it possible to clean the image and increase its dynamic range.

The parametric Rao and parametric generalised likelihood ratio test detectors, recently developed by modelling the disturbance as a multichannel autoregressive (AR) process, have been shown to perform well with limited or even no range training data. These parametric detectors, however, assume that the model order of the multichannel AR process is known a priori to the detector. In practice, the model order has to be estimated by some model order selection technique. Meanwhile, a standard non-recursive implementation of the parametric detectors is computationally intensive since the unknown parameters have to be estimated for all possible model orders before the best one is identified. To address these issues, herein the joint model order selection, parameter estimation and target detection are considered. We present recursive versions of the aforementioned parametric detectors by integrating the multichannel Levinson algorithm, which is employed for recursive and computationally efficient parameter estimation, with a generalised Akaike Information Criterion for model order selection.

The authors propose a method for preprocessing sidescan sonar data for visualisation, detection and classification purposes. Sidescan imagery is highly sensor specific and is typically affected by factors that have either a range dependency or an angular dependency. Each of these is altered in a different way given variations in sensor altitude over the seabed. Working from the physics and geometry of the sonar process, the proposed method estimates separate correction factors for range and angular dependencies directly from the image data. Once calculated, these factors can be applied over large data sets to provide radiometric correction over the entire survey area. Simpler image processing algorithms are more effective because the image statistics are improved with more stable means and variances across the sonar swath. The method requires a good bottom detection algorithm for estimation of sensor altitude at each transmission time and incorporates a resampling scheme for the calculation and application of the angular-dependency correction factors.

The absence of phase information implies that incoherent processing is not constrained by phase-aliasing. Incoherent SAS can accommodate non-uniform inter-ping spacing and is tolerant to trajectory estimation errors of the order of the range-compressed pulse length. This presents new opportunities for a robust surveying system. Apertures of nonlinear shapes can be synthesised depending on the nature and requirement of the specific application and environment.

The results suggest that the water-depth mismatch just shifts the peak around the correct one and the sound-speed mismatch can be neglected for the very low frequency even without constant water sound speed.

The segments of the IF curve whose directions are close to that of the DSPWVD can be highlighted by each DSPWVD and the entire IF curve will be enhanced by the joint TF distribution.

Thus, it will be possible to detect cars and measure their speed from the acquired along track interferometric data. The development of vehicle-detection algorithms requires the knowledge of the radar signatures of vehicles, especially under consideration of the geometry of the radar look direction and the vehicle orientation. The radar signatures of the non-moving cars are presented. They are estimated experimentally from airborne E-SAR multi-frequency and polarimetric data, which have been collected during a flight campaign in 2003. Radar signatures are estimated for a considerable part of aspect angles ranging from 0deg to 180deg. The large synthetic aperture length of the E-SAR radar sensor allows the look processing of data and therefore allows an increase of the aspect angle resolution. The radar signature analysis for one type of passenger cars showed that the largest radar cross-section values and thus the greatest chance for high probability of detection are for cars standing in rear and front views of radar beam direction. This holds true for all frequencies and co-polarisations. Radar cross-section values for cross-polarisations and diagonal views are much lower and are therefore less suitable for car detection.

However, the remaining phase information except for initial phases in complex HRRPs may also contain valuable target discriminant information. RATR using complex HRRPs is discussed. The complex HRRPs' feature subspace within each target-aspect sector is extracted via principal component analysis as the corresponding template during the training phase; while in the test phase we decide that a test sample belongs to the feature subspace which has the test sample's minimum reconstruction error approximation. It is shown that the whole process is independent of the initial phases, but exploits the remaining phase information in complex HRRPs.

The system is based on a supervised approach that uses augmented reality (AR) images for training computer added detection and classification (CAD/CAC) algorithms, which are then deployed on real data. The algorithms are able to generalise and detect real targets when trained on AR ones, with performances comparable with the state-of-the-art in CAD/CAC. To illustrate the approach, the focus is on one specific algorithm, which uses Bayesian decision and the novel, purpose-designed central filter feature extractors. Depending on how the training database is partitioned, the algorithm can be used either for detection or classification. Performance figures for these two modes of operation are presented, both for synthetic and real targets. Typical results show a detection rate of more that 95% and a false alarm rate of less than 5%. The proposed supervised approach can be directly applied to train and evaluate other learning algorithms and data representations.

Given some of the strategic advantages for a bistatic configuration, and technological advances in the past few years, large-scale implementation of the bistatic systems is a scope for the near future. If the bistatic systems are to replace the monostatic systems (at least partially), then all the existing usages of a monostatic system should be manageable in a bistatic system. A detailed investigation of the possibilities of an automatic target recognition (ATR) facility in a bistatic radar system is presented. Because of the lack of data, experiments were carried out on simulated data. Still, the results are positive and make a positive case for the introduction of the bistatic configuration. First, it was found that, contrary to the popular expectation that the bistatic ATR performance might be substantially worse than the monostatic ATR performance, the bistatic ATR performed fairly well (though not better than the monostatic ATR). Second, the ATR performance does not deteriorate substantially with increasing bistatic angle. Last, the polarimetric data from bistatic scattering were found to have distinct information, contrary to expert opinions. Along with these results, suggestions were also made about how to stabilise the bistatic-ATR performance with changing bistatic angle.

Two approaches to improving the dynamic range of modern radar and surveillance receivers are described: (1) linearisation of intermodulation distortion (IMD) using digital post-distortion algorithms and (2) linearisation of IMD using frequency retranslation mixer (FRM). The experimental results presented illustrate that the digital post-distortion and FRM approaches are effective in providing IMD improvements for the hardware and test scenarios measured. The improvements measured ranged from 15 to 35 dB for narrowband signals to 2-6 dB for frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) wideband signals. The digital post-distortion approach provided the greatest performance improvement when the input signals were between the analogue-to-digital converter full range and 20 dB below that level.

Two scheduling algorithms previously reported in the literature are compared in order to investigate differences in their performance. This provides new insights which may be invaluable in the development of future optimal schedulers. A detailed model of a multifunction radar has been developed to enable comparison using the same operational conditions. The radar is assumed to operate in both 'underload' and 'overload' situations. When not fully loaded (i.e. underload), the two scheduling algorithms perform in significantly different ways.
