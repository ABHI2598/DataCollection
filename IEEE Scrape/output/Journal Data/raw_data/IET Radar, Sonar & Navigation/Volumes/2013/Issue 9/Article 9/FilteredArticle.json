Unlike other optimisations, the time-bandwidth product is maintained by ensuring that maximum integration gain is achieved. The advocated technique also permits extended observation intervals without increased processing. Continuous signals of opportunity are interrupted in the receiver; this enables high coherence over extended data acquisition times facilitating high Doppler/velocity resolution. The effect of this technique on integration gain and robustness to target decorrelation is investigated using a simulation. A validating experiment is reported in which a prototype PBR obtains a velocity resolution of 0.07 ms<sup>-1</sup> when measuring a human target."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7459933", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7459933", "pdfSize": "105KB"}, "title": "CFAR target detection for passive multistatic radar with compensation errors", "displayText": "Hong-Yan Zhao, Jun Liu, Zi-Jing Zhang, \"CFAR target detection for passive multistatic radar with compensation errors\", <em>Information Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS) 2015 10th International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2015.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7131111", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131111", "pdfSize": "1413KB"}, "title": "Wideband DTV passive ISAR system design", "displayText": "J.L.
