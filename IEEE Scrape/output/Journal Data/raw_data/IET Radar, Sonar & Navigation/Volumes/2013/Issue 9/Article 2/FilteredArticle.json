To further approach the actual case, the modulation in amplitude and Doppler is considered in the radar backscattering and revealed by short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The results indicate that the micro-Doppler (m-D) effect induced by periodical precession is not represented as a sinusoidal modulation on the edge of BTs as usual, and the amplitude modulation may lead to discontinuity of time-frequency curve. The phenomenon in STFT is confirmed by both simulated and real data from a BT model with precession measured in the microwave anechoic chamber. Based upon the measured data, inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging results have been obtained by smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville time-frequency distribution."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7496586", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7496586", "pdfSize": "453KB"}, "title": "Micro-Doppler period estimation from ballistic targets with precession", "displayText": "Xiao-yi Pan, Qi-xiang Fu, Zhao-yu Gu, Yong-cai Liu, Wei Wang, \"Micro-Doppler period estimation from ballistic targets with precession\", <em>Military Communications and Information Systems (ICMCIS) 2016 International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-6, 2016.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7296594", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7296594", "pdfSize": "631KB"}, "title": "Miss Distance Estimation Based on Scattering Center Model Using Time-Frequency Analysis", "displayText": "Kun-Yi Guo, Quan-You Qu, Ai-Xi Feng, Xin-Qing Sheng, \"Miss Distance Estimation Based on Scattering Center Model Using Time-Frequency Analysis\", <em>Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 15, pp. 1012-1015, 2016, ISSN 1536-1225.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6983554", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983554", "pdfSize": "2036KB"}, "title": "Signature Extraction From Rotating Targets Based on a Fraction of HRRPs", "displayText": "Xiao-Yi Pan, Wei Wang, De-Jun Feng, Yong-Cai Liu, Guo-Yu Wang, \"Signature Extraction From Rotating Targets Based on a Fraction of HRRPs\", <em>Antennas and Propagation IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 63, pp. 585-592, 2015, ISSN 0018-926X.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6937134", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6937134", "pdfSize": "933KB"}, "title": "Parameter Estimation of Radar Targets with Macro-Motion and Micro-Motion Based on Circular Correlation Coefficients", "displayText": "Wenpeng Zhang, Kangle Li, Weidong Jiang, \"Parameter Estimation of Radar Targets with Macro-Motion and Micro-Motion Based on Circular Correlation Coefficients\", <em>Signal Processing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 22, pp. 633-637, 2015, ISSN 1070-9908.", "order": "4"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2015-07-29T15:16:16", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Modulation effect and inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging of rotationally symmetric ballistic targets with precession", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.042134S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Modulation effect and inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging of rotationally symmetric ballistic targets with precession", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6684125/6684219", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "4"}}
