Through unitary transformation, the transmit direction matrix is transformed to be real-valued, and through data expansion based on the structure of the Vandermonde-like matrix, the receive array is twice as long as that of the conventional method. Then the trilinear decomposition can be used to obtain the estimations of the expanded receive direction matrix and real-valued transmit direction matrix, which contain the angle information. Finally the angles can be jointly estimated by using normalisation and least squares. The proposed algorithm requires no spectral peak searching and can achieve automatically paired estimations of angles, and it has better angle estimation performance and can detect more targets than the conventional trilinear decomposition-based method. Simulation results verify the performance of the proposed algorithm."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7338775", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7338775", "pdfSize": "229KB"}, "title": "An ESPRIT-like algorithm for angle estimation in bistatic MIMO radar", "displayText": "Liu Haomiao, Ma Hongguang, Liu Zhiqiang, Xu Donghui, \"An ESPRIT-like algorithm for angle estimation in bistatic MIMO radar\", <em>Signal Processing Communications and Computing (ICSPCC) 2015 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2015.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2015-07-29T15:16:16", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Improved trilinear decomposition-based method for angle estimation in multiple-input multiple-output radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.026414S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Improved trilinear decomposition-based method for angle estimation in multiple-input multiple-output radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6684125/6684270", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
