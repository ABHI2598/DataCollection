A novel ISAR imaging scheme based on the extension form of match Fourier transform (EMFT) is proposed, which estimates the parameters of multi-component cubic chirps via two-dimensional maximisations and Fourier transform. The corresponding asymptotic statistical performance for the EMFT is analysed, and the results of simulated and real data demonstrate the validity of the proposed method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2015-07-29T15:16:19", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging of ship targets with complex motion based on match fourier transform for cubic chirps model", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018575S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging of ship targets with complex motion based on match fourier transform for cubic chirps model", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6684125/6684257", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
