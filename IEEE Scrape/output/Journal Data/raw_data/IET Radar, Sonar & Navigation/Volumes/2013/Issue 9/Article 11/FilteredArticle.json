To mitigate this problem, a wideswath GMTI method based on compressed sensing (CS) is proposed. In this method, CS is utilised to process each SAR data sampled sparsely in the azimuth direction for multiple aperture systems after conventional range compression. Then the wavelet transform matrix is used to construct the sparse matrix. Each SAR image is unambiguously achieved by solving <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> norm optimisation problem in the azimuth. The clutter rejection is performed for all spatial SAR images and then moving targets can be well detected. In this way, the data rate together with storage load is reduced, and then the wideswath GMTI can be efficiently realised. Results of real measured and simulated SAR data processing demonstrate the effectiveness of the CS-based wideswath GMTI."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7070717", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7070717", "pdfSize": "667KB"}, "title": "Radar Change Imaging With Undersampled Data Based on Matrix Completion and Bayesian Compressive Sensing", "displayText": "Hui Bi, Chenglong Jiang, Bingchen Zhang, Zhengdao Wang, Wen Hong, \"Radar Change Imaging With Undersampled Data Based on Matrix Completion and Bayesian Compressive Sensing\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 12, pp. 1546-1550, 2015, ISSN 1545-598X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7442855", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7442855", "pdfSize": "7568KB"}, "title": "Simultaneous Stationary Scene Imaging and Ground Moving Target Indication for High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR System", "displayText": "Xueshi Li, Mengdao Xing, Xiang-Gen Xia, Guang-Cai Sun, Yi Liang, Zheng Bao, \"Simultaneous Stationary Scene Imaging and Ground Moving Target Indication for High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR System\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 54, pp. 4224-4239, 2016, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6835178", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6835178", "pdfSize": "3077KB"}, "title": "Robust Clutter Suppression and Moving Target Imaging Approach for Multichannel in Azimuth High-Resolution and Wide-Swath Synthetic Aperture Radar", "displayText": "Shuang-Xi Zhang, Meng-Dao Xing, Xiang-Gen Xia, Rui Guo, Yan-Yang Liu, Zheng Bao, \"Robust Clutter Suppression and Moving Target Imaging Approach for Multichannel in Azimuth High-Resolution and Wide-Swath Synthetic Aperture Radar\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 53, pp. 687-709, 2015, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:38", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Wideswath synthetic aperture radar ground moving targets indication with low data rate based on compressed sensing", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.041071S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Wideswath synthetic aperture radar ground moving targets indication with low data rate based on compressed sensing", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6684125/6684220", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
