Each measurement may be a clutter measurement or a target detection. In addition to the position [range and angle(s)], measurements often include Doppler velocity. The Doppler velocity measurements are often (e.g. with the linearly modulated frequency transmitted signal) correlated with the range measurements. This study deals with data association (via measurement likelihoods) and estimation in this situation, with a special consideration of the Gaussian mixture approaches. A simulation study shows the benefit of this approach."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7015334", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7015334", "pdfSize": "744KB"}, "title": "Non-parametric multi-target tracking with Doppler measurements", "displayText": "Gongjian Zhou, Ding Ma, Taifan Quan, \"Non-parametric multi-target tracking with Doppler measurements\", <em>Signal Processing (ICSP) 2014 12th International Conference on</em>, pp. 1952-1957, 2014, ISSN 2164-5221.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:49:36", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Correlated Doppler-assisted target tracking in clutter", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.026276S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Correlated Doppler-assisted target tracking in clutter", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6475219/6475231", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
