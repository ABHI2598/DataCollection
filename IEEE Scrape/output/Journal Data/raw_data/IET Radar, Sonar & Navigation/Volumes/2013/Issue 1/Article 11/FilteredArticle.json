Further, the radiated signal of the marine vessel propagating towards a distant receiver undergoes random fluctuations in phase, amplitude and frequency. The ambient noise at the receiver will further complicate the authors' classification problem. The shallow underwater channel, in particular, where these classification systems are more likely to operate presents the most challenges because of severe time-varying multi-path. Cepstral approaches are proposed in this study, including cepstral features and average cepstral features to augment existing feature sets that are mostly based on spectral analysis. Analytical studies have been supported by simulation experiments and tests on real ship recorded data. The cepstral features with cepstral liftering process is able to significantly reduce the multipath distortion effects of shallow underwater channel whereas the average cepstral feature is able to notably reduce the time-varying channel effects."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6986276", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986276", "pdfSize": "1267KB"}, "title": "Research of underwater acoustic confrontation technology based on warship radiated noise modeling", "displayText": "Kun Wei, Zengli Liu, Xuchen Zhang, \"Research of underwater acoustic confrontation technology based on warship radiated noise modeling\", <em>Signal Processing Communications and Computing (ICSPCC) 2014 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 659-662, 2014.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7091378", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7091378", "pdfSize": "432KB"}, "title": "Modeling of ambient and ship noise in underwater ocean environment of the Bay of Bengal", "displayText": "Chandan Pradhan, Anubha Gupta, \"Modeling of ambient and ship noise in underwater ocean environment of the Bay of Bengal\", <em>Signal Processing Informatics Communication and Energy Systems (SPICES) 2015 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-5, 2015.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7108220", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7108220", "pdfSize": "337KB"}, "title": "Issues and an optimal application of acoustic survey for freshwater cetaceans", "displayText": "Arnab Das, Tomonari Akamatsu, \"Issues and an optimal application of acoustic survey for freshwater cetaceans\", <em>Underwater Technology (UT) 2015 IEEE</em>, pp. 1-6, 2015.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T12:19:25", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Marine vessel classification based on passive sonar data: the cepstrum-based approach", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.032909S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Marine vessel classification based on passive sonar data: the cepstrum-based approach", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6475219/6475230", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
