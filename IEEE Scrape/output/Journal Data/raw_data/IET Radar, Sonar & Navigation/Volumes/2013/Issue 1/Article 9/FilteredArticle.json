These coefficients are broadcast to the users on the basis of seasonal ionospheric variations and average solar flux. In low-latitude Indian region, prediction of the delay using these coefficient is not accurate because of complex behaviour of the ionospheric. In this study, new Klobuchar-like cofficients are generated using regional total electron content data collected from the 18 stations in Indian. Using these coefficients, a novel approach for near-real-time prediction of the ionospheric delay (for every 5 min) is proposed. This approach provides the opportunity to generate the Klobuchar-like coefficients using shorter data sets (1 day) rather than using long-term statistics of several years, as done in the generation of GPS broadcast Klobuchar coefficients. Performance of the prediction is evaluated for the geomagnetic quiet (A<sub>p</sub> index &lt;;50) and severely disturbed (A<sub>p</sub> index &gt;300) days of 2005 and 2007. Prediction accuracy is significantly improved using the single-frequency users of the Regional Navigational Satellite Systems, such as the proposed Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:49:56", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Approach for near-real-time prediction of ionospheric delay using Klobuchar-like coefficients for Indian region", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.02083S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Approach for near-real-time prediction of ionospheric delay using Klobuchar-like coefficients for Indian region", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6475219/6475228", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
