A key issue is accurate navigation, especially for survey applications large cumulative error are introduced by the various position sensors: accelerometer; Doppler velocity log; compass; inertial navigation sensors. Algorithms such as simultaneous localisation and mapping rely on accurate landmark recognition in order to correct the vehicle position. This study proposes a solution based on broadband sonar and passive artificial coded landmarks to improve the navigation. Through resolution of the wave equation for acoustic propagation in a multilayer concentric sphere, it is shown that there is a great diversity in the echo spectrum with only small changes in internal structure. This enables the design of a set of passive landmarks, which can be identified unambiguously, since each has a characteristic signature or spectral code when insonified with a broadband sonar."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-14T10:52:09", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Design of artificial landmarks for underwater simultaneous localisation and mapping", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.022212S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Design of artificial landmarks for underwater simultaneous localisation and mapping", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6475219/6475222", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
