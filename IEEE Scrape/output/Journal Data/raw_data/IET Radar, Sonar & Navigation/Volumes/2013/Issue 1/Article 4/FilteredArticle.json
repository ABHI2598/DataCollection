It is difficult to design a decorrelation method with fine performance. Among those decorrelation methods based on <i>LDL</i><sup>T</sup> decomposition, direct-ordering method (DOM) is the one that follows the principle of ordering diagonal elements of variance-covariance matrix before decorrelation. In the present study, the authors propose a diagonal element precomputing and an ordering method (DEPOM) based on <i>LDL</i><sup>T</sup>. DEPOM orders diagonal elements of the matrix according to values after <i>LDL</i><sup>T</sup> decomposition, in contrast to DOM according to values before <i>LDL</i><sup>T</sup> decomposition. Thus, DEPOM is closer to the aim of arranging the larger diagonal element to the larger row before decomposition. The nodus is to determine elements in decomposed <i>L</i> and <i>D</i> matrices, which constitutes an improved <i>LDL</i><sup>T</sup> decomposition method. The above study show that DEPOM has better decorrelation degree and a higher success rate than DOM from the numerical simulation tests. The performance of DEPOM is equivalent to the united ambiguity decorrelation method. However, it is different. DEPOM is a supplement to the integer least-squares theory. The improved <i>LDL</i><sup>T</sup> decomposition is also a new form in the <i>LDL</i><sup>T</sup> decomposition family."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T14:36:25", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Global Navigation Satellite System ambiguity decorrelation through diagonal elements precomputing and ordering method", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019864S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Global Navigation Satellite System ambiguity decorrelation through diagonal elements precomputing and ordering method", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6475219/6475223", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
