In this study, the m-D effect induced by rotational micro-motion in wideband radar is analysed, and an algorithm for the extraction of these m-D features is proposed. By making use of the amplitude and phase information of `range-slow-time image', a dictionary with m-D signal atoms is constructed in the complex image space. The orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm in vector space is then extended to the complex image space to decompose the range-slow-time image and to extract the m-D features of the target. The proposed algorithm can extract the m-D features in the presence of migration through range cells of micro-motional scatterers, and can also work well when the sampling rate in slow-time domain is lower than the Nyquist sampling rate. Simulations are given to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7131589", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131589", "pdfSize": "3701KB"}, "title": "An Adaptive ISAR-Imaging-Considered Task Scheduling Algorithm for Multi-Function Phased Array Radars", "displayText": "Yijun Chen, Qun Zhang, Ning Yuan, Ying Luo, Hao Lou, \"An Adaptive ISAR-Imaging-Considered Task Scheduling Algorithm for Multi-Function Phased Array Radars\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 63, pp. 5096-5110, 2015, ISSN 1053-587X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7206530", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206530", "pdfSize": "2416KB"}, "title": "Sinusoidal Frequency Modulation Sparse Recovery for Precession Rate Estimation Using Low-Frequency Long-Range Radar", "displayText": "Bo Peng, Zhen Liu, Xizhang Wei, Xiang Li, \"Sinusoidal Frequency Modulation Sparse Recovery for Precession Rate Estimation Using Low-Frequency Long-Range Radar\", <em>Sensors Journal IEEE</em>, vol. 15, pp. 7329-7340, 2015, ISSN 1530-437X.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6803978", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6803978", "pdfSize": "2404KB"}, "title": "SAR-Based Paired Echo Focusing and Suppression of Vibrating Targets", "displayText": "Yuan Zhang, Jinping Sun, Peng Lei, Wen Hong, \"SAR-Based Paired Echo Focusing and Suppression of Vibrating Targets\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 52, pp. 7593-7605, 2014, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7015330", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7015330", "pdfSize": "829KB"}, "title": "Parameter estimation of walking human based on micro-Doppler", "displayText": "Zhongsheng Sun, Jun Wang, Changshun Yuan, Yanxian Bi, Hong Xiang, \"Parameter estimation of walking human based on micro-Doppler\", <em>Signal Processing (ICSP) 2014 12th International Conference on</em>, pp. 1934-1937, 2014, ISSN 2164-5221.", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7336490", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7336490", "pdfSize": "4131KB"}, "title": "Sub-Nyquist Sampling Jamming Against ISAR With CS-Based HRRP Reconstruction", "displayText": "Xiao-Yi Pan, Wei Wang, Guo-Yu Wang, \"Sub-Nyquist Sampling Jamming Against ISAR With CS-Based HRRP Reconstruction\", <em>Sensors Journal IEEE</em>, vol. 16, pp. 1597-1602, 2016, ISSN 1530-437X.", "order": "5"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7131147", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131147", "pdfSize": "1872KB"}, "title": "Combined high range resolution and micro-Doppler analysis of human gait", "displayText": "Z.
