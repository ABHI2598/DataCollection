The receive data can be mapped to a PARALIND model, after which the estimations of transmit/receive directional matrices and the correlated matrix of the sources are all obtained through PARALIND decomposition. Finally, the estimates of direction of departures and direction of arrivals can be obtained by least-square principle. In contrast to the forward-backward spatial smoothing-propagator (FBSS) method and FBSS-estimation method of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques algorithms, the proposed method not only reaches paired estimates of the angles automatically but also has much better performance for angle estimation. On the other hand, our algorithm can be used for angle estimation in non-uniform linear transmit/receive array. Simulations present the effectiveness of our approach."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:28:48", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Coherent angle estimation in bistatic multi-input multi-output radar using parallel profile with linear dependencies decomposition", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.021367S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Coherent angle estimation in bistatic multi-input multi-output radar using parallel profile with linear dependencies decomposition", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6619459/6619464", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
