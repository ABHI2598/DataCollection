Quasi-optimal algorithms for target detection and range measurement are analysed, which demonstrate close to optimal performance even if low-performance signal processing equipment is used. Special attention is given to stroboscopic sampling. In the case of a high signal-to-noise ratio, stroboscopic sampling can provide better detection performance than traditional, or real-time, sampling. The accuracy of range finders with stroboscopic signal sampling is estimated. The considered method allows for a reduction in both instrumental range measurement error and random error of tracking compared with traditional sampling methods, without an increase in requirements of the range finders' performance."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7292687", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7292687", "pdfSize": "2385KB"}, "title": "Real-time, pseudo real-time and stroboscopic sampling in time-domain GPRs", "displayText": "Davide Pasculli, Guido Manacorda, \"Real-time pseudo real-time and stroboscopic sampling in time-domain GPRs\", <em>Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar (IWAGPR) 2015 8th International Workshop on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2015.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:23:36", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Analysis of stroboscopic signal sampling for radar target detectors and range finders", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.020829S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analysis of stroboscopic signal sampling for radar target detectors and range finders", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573727", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
