Chaos is introduced to generate orthogonal phase-coded waveforms of arbitrary coded length for arbitrary number of transmitters. However, most of these chaos-based waveforms suffer high range sidelobe level and intrapulse Doppler intolerance for pulse compression. A complementary transmitting structure is proposed for the MIMO radar to supress these high range sidelobes, and an adaptive clonal selection algorithm is introduced to search for the optimal complementary codes of the transmitted chaotic phase-coded waveform. This algorithm proves that it is convergent in theory as well. A multiple hypotheses approach is introduced at the transmitters to estimate and then compensate for the intrapulse Doppler phase shift for MIMO radar pulse compression countering the intrapulse Doppler intolerance. Numerical simulations with four typical chaotic maps are carried out and compared with Deng's codes, which validate the proposed methods of this study."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7272868", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272868", "pdfSize": "1477KB"}, "title": "MIMO OFDM radar IRCI free range reconstruction with sufficient cyclic prefix", "displayText": "Xiang-gen Xia, Tianxian Zhang, Lingjiang Kong, \"MIMO OFDM radar IRCI free range reconstruction with sufficient cyclic prefix\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 51, pp. 2276-2293, 2015, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7161283", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7161283", "pdfSize": "2034KB"}, "title": "Interleaved OFDM Signals for MIMO Radar", "displayText": "Zhibin Lin, Zongbo Wang, \"Interleaved OFDM Signals for MIMO Radar\", <em>Sensors Journal IEEE</em>, vol. 15, pp. 6294-6305, 2015, ISSN 1530-437X.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7334154", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7334154", "pdfSize": "455KB"}, "title": "A new multicarrier chaotic phase coded stepped-frequency pulse train radar signal and its characteristic analysis", "displayText": "Huang Qiongdan, Li Yong, Cheng Wei, Liu Weihua, Li Bo, \"A new multicarrier chaotic phase coded stepped-frequency pulse train radar signal and its characteristic analysis\", <em>Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA) 2015 IEEE 10th Conference on</em>, pp. 444-448, 2015.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7472957", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7472957", "pdfSize": "2345KB"}, "title": "Piecewise LFM waveform for MIMO radar", "displayText": "Caicai Gao, Kah Chan Teh, Aifei Liu, Hongbo Sun, \"Piecewise LFM waveform for MIMO radar\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 52, pp. 590-602, 2016, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6828702", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6828702", "pdfSize": "1031KB"}, "title": "Orthogonal Frequency Diversity Waveform with Range-Doppler Optimization for MIMO Radar", "displayText": "Caicai Gao, Kah Chan Teh, Aifei Liu, \"Orthogonal Frequency Diversity Waveform with Range-Doppler Optimization for MIMO Radar\", <em>Signal Processing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 21, pp. 1201-1205, 2014, ISSN 1070-9908.", "order": "5"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7707413", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7707413", "pdfSize": "2502KB"}, "title": "Designing Sequence With Minimum PSL Using Chebyshev Distance and its Application for Chaotic MIMO Radar Waveform Design", "displayText": "Hamid Esmaeili-Najafabadi, Mohammad Ataei, Mohammad Farzan Sabahi, \"Designing Sequence With Minimum PSL Using Chebyshev Distance and its Application for Chaotic MIMO Radar Waveform Design\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 65, pp. 690-704, 2017, ISSN 1053-587X.", "order": "6"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T14:05:08", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Complementary-based chaotic phase-coded waveforms design for MIMO radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.073412S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Complementary-based chaotic phase-coded waveforms design for MIMO radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573719", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "6"}}
