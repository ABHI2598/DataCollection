In this study, wideband T/R-R bistatic radar is introduced to estimate the real radius of a rotational scatterer. The geometric relation between the bistatic radar and a rotational scatterer is modelled first. By combining the parameters of the trace of the same rotational scatterer in the mono- and bistatic time-range images, a method based on parameter estimation, scatterer association and equation solving is proposed to estimate the real rotational radius. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by lots of numeric simulations."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T13:31:33", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Feature extraction of rotational yargets in wideband T/R-R bistatic radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019017S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Feature extraction of rotational yargets in wideband T/R-R bistatic radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573717", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
