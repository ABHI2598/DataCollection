To do this, the mathematical model of the creation of radar information is performed. The mathematical model is afterwards presented in the form of an algorithm flowchart for the process of the radar information creation. The model will be applied as part of a simulator for the staff training in the Czech Air Force operational centres."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7153723", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7153723", "pdfSize": "535KB"}, "title": "Conceptual operational architecture of the air force simulator: Simulation of air defense operations", "displayText": "Jan Farlik, \"Conceptual operational architecture of the air force simulator: Simulation of air defense operations\", <em>Military Technologies (ICMT) 2015 International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-5, 2015.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7153687", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7153687", "pdfSize": "2350KB"}, "title": "Simulation of surface-to-air missile units: Cluster design", "displayText": "Jan Farlik, \"Simulation of surface-to-air missile units: Cluster design\", <em>Military Technologies (ICMT) 2015 International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-6, 2015.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T14:03:38", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Radar information creation with use of a simulation environment", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.02481S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Radar information creation with use of a simulation environment", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573715", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
