To monitor and track the moving ground target using unmanned aerial vehicle aboard a moving target indicator, an interactive multiple model (IMM) filter is firstly applied. The IMM filter consists of an on-road moving mode using a road-constrained filter and an off-road moving mode using a conventional filter. Mode probability is also calculated from the IMM filter, and it provides deviation of the vehicle from the road. Then, a novel hybrid algorithm for anomalous behaviour recognition is developed using a Gaussian process regression on velocity profile along the one-dimensionalised position of the vehicle, as well as the deviation of the vehicle. To verify the feasibility and benefits of the proposed approach, a numerical simulation is performed using realistic car trajectory data in a city traffic."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7590608", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590608", "pdfSize": "283KB"}, "title": "New Environmental Dependent Modelling with Gaussian Particle Filtering Based Implementation for Ground Vehicle Tracking", "displayText": "Miao Yu, Yali Xue, Runxiao Ding, Hyondong Oh, Wen-Hua Chen, Jonathon Chambers, \"New Environmental Dependent Modelling with Gaussian Particle Filtering Based Implementation for Ground Vehicle Tracking\", <em>Sensor Signal Processing for Defence (SSPD) 2016</em>, pp. 1-5, 2016.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T11:53:26", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Airborne behaviour monitoring using Gaussian processes with map information", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.025514S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Airborne behaviour monitoring using Gaussian processes with map information", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573721", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
