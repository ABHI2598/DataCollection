This is largely, because of the device's inability to obtain the exact transmitting time of ADS-B data packets. In order to study and establish an efficient and accurate error registration algorithm for radars based on the ADS-B system, a joint systematic error estimation model of the radar and ADS-B was built. The authors showed that when receiving time is known, the time difference between radar measuring time and ADS-B data transmitting time is consistently biased, a feature that can be used to calculate the systematic error of the ADS-B receiving system. Then, they established an error estimation model based on the joint systematic error of the radar and ADS-B. The generalised least squares estimation method was adopted to solve the model. Finally, data samples verified the accuracy and effectiveness of the error registration algorithm."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7113878", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7113878", "pdfSize": "3163KB"}, "title": "Adaptive Air-to-Ground Secure Communication System Based on ADS-B and Wide-Area Multilateration", "displayText": "Yogesh Anil Nijsure, Georges Kaddoum, Ghyslain Gagnon, Francois Gagnon, Chau Yuen, Rajarshi Mahapatra, \"Adaptive Air-to-Ground Secure Communication System Based on ADS-B and Wide-Area Multilateration\", <em>Vehicular Technology IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 65, pp. 3150-3165, 2016, ISSN 0018-9545.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T13:33:37", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Joint systematic error estimation algorithm for radar and automatic dependent surveillance broadcasting", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.024993S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Joint systematic error estimation algorithm for radar and automatic dependent surveillance broadcasting", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573718", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
