In the IMM, the conventional Gaussian likelihood is replaced with a Gaussian sum (GS) likelihood, derived from a sensor model accounting for both the measurements and jamming information. Thus, the model-conditioned posterior probability density function of the state is also a weighted sum of Gaussians but with recalculated weights. As a result of the combination of multiple models and jamming information, the proposed approach has a significant performance improvement when both manoeuvre and jamming occur. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the original IMM algorithm as well as the GS filters with only one model in terms of track loss and track accuracy."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7260218", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7260218", "pdfSize": "538KB"}, "title": "Fusing Kalman filter with TLD algorithm for target tracking", "displayText": "Chengjian Sun, Songhao Zhu, Jiawei Liu, \"Fusing Kalman filter with TLD algorithm for target tracking\", <em>Control Conference (CCC) 2015 34th Chinese</em>, pp. 3736-3741, 2015, ISSN 1934-1768.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:40", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Multiple model tracking of manoeuvring targets accounting for standoff jamming information", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.022593S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Multiple model tracking of manoeuvring targets accounting for standoff jamming information", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573716", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
