The evaluation is conducted on the signal at the output of a conventional incoherent receiver followed by a logarithmic amplifier, assuming that the target returns at the two beam positions are correlated random variables. The general expression of the normalised root mean square error of the angular estimate is derived. Then, it is particularised to Swerling I target fluctuation at each of the beam positions. Additionally, assuming high signal-to-noise ratio, the probability density function of the angular estimate is provided. Finally, using Monte Carlo techniques, several numerical results are given and the effects of typical values of the correlation coefficient are discussed."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:51", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Theoretical analysis of the sequential lobing technique for correlated targets", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019708S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Theoretical analysis of the sequential lobing technique for correlated targets", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573726", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
