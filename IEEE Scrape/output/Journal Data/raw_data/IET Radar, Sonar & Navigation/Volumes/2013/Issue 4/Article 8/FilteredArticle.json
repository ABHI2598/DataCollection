This means that the performance of detectors can be measured relative to a benchmark detector. In the context of coherent multilook detection in a Pareto clutter environment, the whitening matched filter (WMF) detector, which is optimal for Gaussian clutter, has been observed to perform very well as a suboptimal detector. Based upon this, variations of the WMF are constructed and analysed."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T11:53:11", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Assessing detector performance, with application to pareto coherent multilook radar detection", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019006S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Assessing detector performance, with application to pareto coherent multilook radar detection", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573722", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
