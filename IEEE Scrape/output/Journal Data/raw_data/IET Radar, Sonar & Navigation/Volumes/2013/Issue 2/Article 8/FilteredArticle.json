This design includes a flanged shroud around the turbine which concentrates the wind flow past the turbine blades and hence improves the efficiency. The design also offers improved safety and reduces acoustic noise. Furthermore, it may offer a significantly lower radar signature, which may make the design much more attractive for use in situations where conventional wind turbine designs may disturb the operation of radars. The authors present the results of an experimental trial, carried out in the UK, to measure the radar cross section (RCS) of a 5 kW Wind Lens turbine prototype and provide a reference database that can be used for comparing the Wind Lens RCS with that of conventional turbines. The authors also investigate the methods to further reduce the Wind Lens RCS and present the results of a time-varying Doppler analysis. The results show that the addition of a metallic mesh around the shroud obscures the rotating blades, and hence mitigates the RCS by 15 dB, at angles where the radar interference is highest."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6875608", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875608", "pdfSize": "1535KB"}, "title": "Measurements and analysis of multistatic and multimodal micro-Doppler signatures for automatic target classification", "displayText": "Marcio Perassoli, Alessio Balleri, Karl Woodbridge, \"Measurements and analysis of multistatic and multimodal micro-Doppler signatures for automatic target classification\", <em>Radar Conference 2014 IEEE</em>, pp. 0324-0328, 2014.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7411894", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7411894", "pdfSize": "1744KB"}, "title": "Analysis of multiband monostatic and bistatic radar signatures of wind turbines", "displayText": "Francesco Fioranelli, Matthew Ritchie, Hugh Griffiths, Alessio Balleri, \"Analysis of multiband monostatic and bistatic radar signatures of wind turbines\", <em>Radar Conference 2015 IEEE</em>, pp. 277-282, 2015.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7481497", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7481497", "pdfSize": "601KB"}, "title": "On simulating the high-resolution radar image of a wind turbine", "displayText": "Chenchen J.
