However, system distortion because of miscalibration may affect the classification performance to some extent. The study described in this article is an attempt at deriving the polarimetric calibration requirements on several algorithms for the classification of land features. In the monostatic backscattering case, the model representing the effects of the residual distortion of the calibrated polarimetric data is presented first, followed by analysing the effects of miscalibration on a few commonly used polarimetric parameters and several classification schemes. Experimental results show that polarimetric calibration requirements not only are strongly dependent on classification methods but also directly relate to the underlying physical scattering mechanisms of the observables. For each classification algorithm under study, a set of numbers summarising the polarimetric calibration goals concludes this study."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7346309", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7346309", "pdfSize": "311KB"}, "title": "Calibration of polarimetric radar system with giant aperture antenna", "displayText": "Jianzhi Lin, Weixing Li, Yue Zhang, Qianqiang Lin, Zengping Chen, \"Calibration of polarimetric radar system with giant aperture antenna\", <em>Radar Conference (EuRAD) 2015 European</em>, pp. 349-352, 2015.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7346027", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7346027", "pdfSize": "310KB"}, "title": "Calibration of polarimetric radar system with giant aperture antenna", "displayText": "Jianzhi Lin, Weixing Li, Yue Zhang, Qianqiang Lin, Zengping Chen, \"Calibration of polarimetric radar system with giant aperture antenna\", <em>Microwave Conference (EuMC) 2015 European</em>, pp. 1371-1374, 2015.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7494951", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7494951", "pdfSize": "472KB"}, "title": "Polarimetric Calibration Based on Lexicographic-Basis Decomposition", "displayText": "Jianzhi Lin, Yongqiang Guo, Weixing Li, Yue Zhang, Zengping Chen, \"Polarimetric Calibration Based on Lexicographic-Basis Decomposition\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 13, pp. 1149-1152, 2016, ISSN 1545-598X.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:56", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Polarimetric calibration requirements on several classification schemes for land application of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.0312S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Polarimetric calibration requirements on several classification schemes for land application of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6526675/6526677", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
