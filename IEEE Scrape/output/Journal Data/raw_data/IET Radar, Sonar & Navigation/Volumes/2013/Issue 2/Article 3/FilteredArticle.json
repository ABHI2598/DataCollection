A parametric model is used to formulate the received SAR signal, each scatterer can be characterised by a set of its parameters. In the model, the instantaneous slant range is approximated by a polynomial. The parameters of each scatterer are estimated by maximising the cost function, named matching degree indicator. The root-mean-square errors of parameter estimation are close to the Cramer-Rao bounds. The image is formed by mapping the estimated parameters onto the grid formed by isorange and iso-Doppler lines. The algorithm does not require explicit knowledge of the data collection geometry. Experimental results are given to validate the algorithm."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7306321", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306321", "pdfSize": "378KB"}, "title": "A SAR imaging technique for the target of complex azimuth envelope based on information extraction", "displayText": "Hui Sheng, Bingqi Zhu, Yesheng Gao, Kaizhi Wang, Xingzhao Liu, Yiran Jin, \"A SAR imaging technique for the target of complex azimuth envelope based on information extraction\", <em>Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR) 2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on</em>, pp. 783-787, 2015.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6946791", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6946791", "pdfSize": "256KB"}, "title": "Complex target-induced azimuth envelope reconstruction from SAR RAW data", "displayText": "Hui Sheng, Bingqi Zhu, Yesheng Gao, Kaizhi Wang, Xingzhao Liu, \"Complex target-induced azimuth envelope reconstruction from SAR RAW data\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2014 IEEE International</em>, pp. 1753-1756, 2014.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:58:18", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Model-based adaptive synthetic aperture radar image formation algorithm", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.030443S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Model-based adaptive synthetic aperture radar image formation algorithm", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6526675/6526678", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
