Extended targets (as opposed to point target) have various scattering centres, such as the familiar point, localised and distributed scattering centres, as well as the rarely discussed but often encountered migratory scattering centres. The migratory scattering phenomenon of smooth surface is particularly concerned in this study. The motion information recoded in radar signals are actually that of migratory scattering centres rather than the real motions of the rigid target. Therefore the misleading motion information will bring unpredictable error to the radar application of target discrimination or recognition. To tackle this problem, the influence of migratory scattering phenomena of extended targets on micro-motion characteristics contained in radar signal is analysed in detail. Some meaningful conclusions are reached. The backscattered signals of extended targets are computed by the well-validated fullwave numerical method, hybrid finite element-boundary integral-multilevel fast multipole algorithm. The numerical results agree well with the analytical conclusions given in this study."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7364201", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7364201", "pdfSize": "6413KB"}, "title": "Geometry Reconstruction Based on Attributes of Scattering Centers by Using Time-Frequency Representations", "displayText": "Kun-Yi Guo, Quan-You Qu, Xin-Qing Sheng, \"Geometry Reconstruction Based on Attributes of Scattering Centers by Using Time-Frequency Representations\", <em>Antennas and Propagation IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 64, pp. 708-720, 2016, ISSN 0018-926X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6948314", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6948314", "pdfSize": "791KB"}, "title": "Scattering Centers Induced by Creeping Waves on Streamlined Cone-Shaped Targets in Bistatic Mode", "displayText": "Quan-You Qu, Kun-Yi Guo, Xin-Qing Sheng, \"Scattering Centers Induced by Creeping Waves on Streamlined Cone-Shaped Targets in Bistatic Mode\", <em>Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 14, pp. 462-465, 2015, ISSN 1536-1225.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7729683", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729683", "pdfSize": "224KB"}, "title": "Angular glint simulation based on scattering center model", "displayText": "Qi-Feng Li, Kun-Yi Guo, Xin-Qing Sheng, \"Angular glint simulation based on scattering center model\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2016 IEEE International</em>, pp. 2646-2649, 2016, ISSN 2153-7003.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7052628", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7052628", "pdfSize": "320KB"}, "title": "Applications of sliding scattering centers in feature extraction", "displayText": "Quan-You Qu, Kun-Yi Guo, Xin-Qing Sheng, \"Applications of sliding scattering centers in feature extraction\", <em>Computational Electromagnetics (ICCEM) 2015 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 264-266, 2015.", "order": "4"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:36:58", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Influence of migratory scattering phenomenon on micro-motion characteristics contained in radar signals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.035026S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Influence of migratory scattering phenomenon on micro-motion characteristics contained in radar signals", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6574779/6574791", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "4"}}
