The statistical analysis of the measured data shows a distinguishable difference between the unoccupied and occupied portion of the UHF band. The bandwidth availability for the UHF band is shown to follow a Gaussian distribution according to the measurement results. The positioning model is verified using the non-linear least squares, linear least squares and two-step maximum-likelihood location estimation algorithms. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) performance evaluation of the proposed model revealed the advantage of utilising five discrete bands to perform TOA estimation, especially in poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions ranging from &#x2013; 10 to 0 dB. At a fixed SNR of 0 dB, an average RMSE improvement of 74 and 82% was observed for a double- and triple-band system when compared with a conventional single-band TOA system. This particular positioning technique can enable improved location estimation in a dynamic spectrum access environment."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7362555", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7362555", "pdfSize": "135KB"}, "title": "Step-adaptive approximate least squares", "displayText": "Michael Lunglmayr, Christoph Unterrieder, Mario Huemer, \"Step-adaptive approximate least squares\", <em>Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO) 2015 23rd European</em>, pp. 1108-1112, 2015, ISSN 2076-1465.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7429145", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429145", "pdfSize": "602KB"}, "title": "The Comparison Study of Wavelet and Wavelet Packet Analysis in the De-noising of EEG Test Signal", "displayText": "Yifeng Li, Lihui Zhang, Baohui Li, Guiding Yan, Xichen Geng, Zhao Jin, Yan Xu, Haixia Wang, Xiaoyan Liu, Rong Lin, Xiaoyang Wei, Quan Wang, \"The Comparison Study of Wavelet and Wavelet Packet Analysis in the De-noising of EEG Test Signal\", <em>Information Technology in Medicine and Education (ITME) 2015 7th International Conference on</em>, pp. 274-277, 2015.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T15:27:14", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Multiband time-of-arrival positioning technique using an ultra-high-frequency bandwidth availability model for cognitive radio", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.029933S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Multiband time-of-arrival positioning technique using an ultra-high-frequency bandwidth availability model for cognitive radio", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6574779/6574788", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
