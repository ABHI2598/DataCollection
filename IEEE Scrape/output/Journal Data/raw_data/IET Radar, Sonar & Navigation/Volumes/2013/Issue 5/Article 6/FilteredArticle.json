To that end, thresholded split measurements PF along with non-thresholded measurements, sequential importance resampling PF (SIR PF) and auxiliary variable PF (AV PF) are extended to cope with time-varying target presence. Simulations show superiorities in working through non-thresholded measurements. Furthermore, they surprisingly demonstrate that non-thresholded measurements SIR PF leads to less root-mean-square position estimation error than non-thresholded measurements AV PF in case of uncertain target presence and unclear measurements origin besides dynamic model mismatching."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6599707", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599707", "pdfSize": "322KB"}, "title": "Enhanced strategy to sample newborn targets within nonthresholded measurements", "displayText": "Meysam R.
