In broadside or small squint cases, the well-focused image can be obtained by the typical two-step MOCO to have the quadratic motion errors compensated. However, with the increasing of squint angle, not only the high-order motion errors, but also the azimuth-variant errors must be taken into account. In this study, a modified non-linear chirp scaling (MNLCS) algorithm is proposed to handle this problem in highlysquinted case. The key is to use the method of series reversion to cover the high-order motion errors, the MNLCS to precondition the data to process the azimuth-variant components and a series expansion to obtain an accurate form of the signal spectrum. The skewed spectrum in highly-squinted case is reduced through the use of a linear range cell migration correction. The simulated results have shown the MNLCS algorithm can handle data with more complicated geometries than the previous algorithm."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:30:48", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Focusing highly squinted data with motion errors based on modified non-linear chirp scaling", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.020504S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Focusing highly squinted data with motion errors based on modified non-linear chirp scaling", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6574779/6574790", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
