In this study, the authors discuss a new range-angle-Doppler monostatic MIMO imaging method through adaptive estimation of the generalised Cauchy prior distribution (GCD). The superiority of GCD-based model over existing &#x2113;<sub>p</sub>-norm-based model (which actually assumes the prior as general Gaussian distribution) is theoretically verified through the issue of signal compressibility. The authors adapt a reweighted &#x2113;<sub>2</sub>-norm iterative algorithm to solve the model. In our model the authors do not pre-define the scaling factor of the prior distribution and, during the iteration, the authors use a novel 'quantile-of-OS' method to adaptively estimate the scaling parameter of the prior distribution, enhancing the robustness of the method. Simulation results verify the image quality and speed advantages of the proposed method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T14:24:53", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Robust compressive multi-input&#x2013;multi-output imaging", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.020681S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Robust compressive multi-input&#x2013;multi-output imaging", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6552463/6552467", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
