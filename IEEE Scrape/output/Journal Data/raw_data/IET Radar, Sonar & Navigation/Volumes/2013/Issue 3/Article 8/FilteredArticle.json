The authors present a maximum likelihood estimation-based unsupervised land cover classification algorithms for hybrid-PolSAR image. This classification technique follows from the m &#x2013; &#x003B4; decomposition of hybrid-Pol images. Introduction of a statistical treatment is the major contribution of the current algorithm. Performance of the hybrid-Pol algorithms have been assessed with respect to Freeman&#x2013;Durden decomposition of fully polarimetric SAR data. The authors have demonstrated, using two different datasets, that proposed algorithm not only gives better overall classification performance, it is also able to classify all the three major types of scattering mechanisms, whereas the existing hybrid-PolSAR classification algorithms mostly fail to classify one of the scattering types."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7411920", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7411920", "pdfSize": "454KB"}, "title": "Classification of hybrid-pol data based on Euclidean distance between Stokes vectors", "displayText": "Ajeet Kumar, Rajib Kumar Panigrahi, \"Classification of hybrid-pol data based on Euclidean distance between Stokes vectors\", <em>Radar Conference 2015 IEEE</em>, pp. 422-425, 2015.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-07-14T10:14:28", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Unsupervised classification of scattering behaviour using hybrid-polarimetry", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.023205S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Unsupervised classification of scattering behaviour using hybrid-polarimetry", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6552463/6552471", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
