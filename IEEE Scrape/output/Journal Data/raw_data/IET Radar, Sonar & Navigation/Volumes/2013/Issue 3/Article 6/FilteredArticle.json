The new algorithm uses a long modulated pulse of relatively low resolution. Using concepts from the field of dynamics, the algorithm measures the similarity between a signal reflected from a target and a previously recorded reference. The authors conducted acoustic experiments with some simple objects to validate the algorithm, although the actual target identification method could be used for radar or sonar."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6875550", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875550", "pdfSize": "1191KB"}, "title": "Target identification based on state space analysis", "displayText": "Thomas L.
