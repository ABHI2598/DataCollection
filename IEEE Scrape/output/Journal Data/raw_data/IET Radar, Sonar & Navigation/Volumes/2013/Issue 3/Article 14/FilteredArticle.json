The challenge is then to discriminate the original object from the spawned ancillaries in a timely fashion. This study proposes a solution to this problem based on the increasingly well-known multi-object track-before-detect algorithm called the cardinalised probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filter. Precisely, the authors assume zero false alarms (ZFA) in the CPHD filter, and apply the proposed scheme to linear and non-linear simulation scenarios based on widely used object-trajectory and sensor models. The authors have also demonstrated that a Gaussian mixture implementation of the ZFA-CPHD filter (i) establishes stable estimates of object number, (ii) rapidly eliminates the ancillary objects and (iii) detects and accurately estimates the trajectory of the original object of interest."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7376202", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7376202", "pdfSize": "1240KB"}, "title": "Distributed spatio-temporal association and tracking of multiple targets using multiple sensors", "displayText": "Guohua Ren, Vasileios Maroulas, Ioannis Schizas, \"Distributed spatio-temporal association and tracking of multiple targets using multiple sensors\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 51, pp. 2570-2589, 2015, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7003956", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7003956", "pdfSize": "248KB"}, "title": "Unscented particle implementation of cardinality balanced multi-target multi-Bernoulli filter", "displayText": "Hao Qiu, Gaoming Huang, Jun Gao, \"Unscented particle implementation of cardinality balanced multi-target multi-Bernoulli filter\", <em>Image and Signal Processing (CISP) 2014 7th International Congress on</em>, pp. 1162-1166, 2014.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7525329", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7525329", "pdfSize": "202KB"}, "title": "On least-squares estimation for partially observed jump-diffusion processes", "displayText": "Seddik M.
