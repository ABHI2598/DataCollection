The proposed algorithm is applied on Doppler radar signal and it represents an alternative approach to Doppler radar signal analysis using the Fourier transform. The algorithm is tested using data obtained in real measurements by ground surveillance Doppler radar. The numerical results are compared with those obtained by the method using the Fourier transform. It is shown that the ground clutter due to windblown vegetation, which is the main challenge for radar to detect moving object, does not affect the information entropy. The impact of two main parameters of the algorithm on information entropy is analysed. The authors discuss on choice of the detector structure, threshold setting and decision rule. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is calculated and compared with the complexity of the method using Fourier transform. It is shown that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is one order of magnitude lower than the computational complexity of the method using Fourier transform."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T14:57:13", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Information-based algorithm for moving object detection", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.017962S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Information-based algorithm for moving object detection", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6552463/6552475", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
