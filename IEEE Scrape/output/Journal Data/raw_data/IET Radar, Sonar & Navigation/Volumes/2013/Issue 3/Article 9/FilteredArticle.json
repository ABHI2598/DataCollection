The quaternion domain facilitates modelling and processing of four-dimensional real signals (or two-dimensional complex signals). Based on the quaternion model of linear symmetric array with twocomponents EM vector-sensors, an interference and noise canceller (INC) is presented for polarised signals. Then, the output signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expression of INC is derived and its performance is analysed. The performance analysis reveal explicitly the fact that even though no separation between the direction of arrival (DOAs) of the desired signal and interference, the maximum value of output SINR can be obtained employing the orthogonality between the polarisations of the desired signal and interference. Simulation results show that if sample size N is large enough, the INC has larger output SINR and better robustness against the DOA mismatch."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7277056", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277056", "pdfSize": "418KB"}, "title": "Adaptive Beamforming for Vector-Sensor Arrays Based on a Reweighted Zero-Attracting Quaternion-Valued LMS Algorithm", "displayText": "Mengdi Jiang, Wei Liu, Yi Li, \"Adaptive Beamforming for Vector-Sensor Arrays Based on a Reweighted Zero-Attracting Quaternion-Valued LMS Algorithm\", <em>Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 63, pp. 274-278, 2016, ISSN 1549-7747.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6900758", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6900758", "pdfSize": "275KB"}, "title": "Quaternion-valued robust adaptive beamformer based on widely linear processing", "displayText": "Xirui Zhang, Zhiwen Liu, Zheyi Fan, Yougen Xu, \"Quaternion-valued robust adaptive beamformer based on widely linear processing\", <em>Digital Signal Processing (DSP) 2014 19th International Conference on</em>, pp. 719-724, 2014, ISSN 2165-3577.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T14:26:14", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Performance analysis for interference and noise canceller based on hypercomplex and spatio-temporal-polarisation processes", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.042319S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Performance analysis for interference and noise canceller based on hypercomplex and spatio-temporal-polarisation processes", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6552463/6552472", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
