Inspired by the visual attention mechanism, pulse contourlet transform is proposed to derive the target-oriented compressive features, and a kernel sparse coding classifier is advanced inspired by the fact that kernel trick can make the features more clustered in higher dimensional space, so resulting in accurate and robust recognition of targets. Some experiments are taken on recognising three types of ground vehicles in the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition public release database, to compare the performance of the proposed scheme with its counterparts, and the results prove its efficiency."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7009379", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7009379", "pdfSize": "275KB"}, "title": "Radar signal recognition algorithm based on entropy theory", "displayText": "Jingchao Li, Yulong Ying, \"Radar signal recognition algorithm based on entropy theory\", <em>Systems and Informatics (ICSAI) 2014 2nd International Conference on</em>, pp. 718-723, 2014.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:53:45", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Compressive feature and kernel sparse coding-based radar target recognition", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.02712S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Compressive feature and kernel sparse coding-based radar target recognition", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6582136/6582141", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
