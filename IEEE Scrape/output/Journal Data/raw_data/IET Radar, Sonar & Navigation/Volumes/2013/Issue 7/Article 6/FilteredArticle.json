In the light of imaging requirements of the ultra-high resolution spaceborne SAR, an advanced range migration algorithm (ARMA) is presented in this study. Firstly, a new slant range model is developed by incorporating straight orbit approximation with additional linear, cubic and quartic term. Subsequently, a two-dimensional spectrum is derived by making use of Fourier transform pairs and the approximate azimuth stationary point based on the new range model. Finally, a novel RMA is derived. In this algorithm, the accurate range cell migration correction (RCMC) is done through two steps: the effective velocity dependence RCMC and the bulk RCMC, and the range-variant azimuth filtering is accomplished. Simulations are carried out to verify our proposed algorithm, which indicate that ARMA can keep precise even the resolution is up to decimeter level."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6868238", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6868238", "pdfSize": "1686KB"}, "title": "A High-Order Imaging Algorithm for High-Resolution Spaceborne SAR Based on a Modified Equivalent Squint Range Model", "displayText": "Pengbo Wang, Wei Liu, Jie Chen, Mu Niu, Wei Yang, \"A High-Order Imaging Algorithm for High-Resolution Spaceborne SAR Based on a Modified Equivalent Squint Range Model\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 53, pp. 1225-1235, 2015, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:47:42", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Advanced range migration algorithm for ultra-high resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.032699S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Advanced range migration algorithm for ultra-high resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6582136/6582142", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
