The antenna architecture is synthesised by optimising the geometric parameters of the passive elements, namely their positions and lengths. The generation of the difference beam is yielded by imposing a phase displacement of <i>&#x03C0;</i> to the excitations of half active array and activating the parasitic array by turning-on the switches that partition their lengths. As for the sum pattern, the effect of the parasitic dipoles is made negligible by turning-off the switches. A set of representative results is reported and discussed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6817526", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6817526", "pdfSize": "806KB"}, "title": "Sidelobe Cancellation for Uniformly Excited Planar Array Antennas by Controlling the Side Elements", "displayText": "J.
