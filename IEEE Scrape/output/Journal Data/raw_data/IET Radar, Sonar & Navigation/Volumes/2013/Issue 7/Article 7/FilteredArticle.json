However, the existing method for analysing the false alarm probability, based on extreme value theory (EVT), leads to the inaccuracy of the obtained detection threshold. In this study, a new analytical approach to compute the false alarm probability of DP-TBD is presented. In the proposed method, the generalised Pareto distribution is utilised to approximate the false alarm probability based on the peaks over threshold model, which can maintain CFAR for DP-TBD method in the low signal-to-noise environment effectively. Simulation results show that this approach provides a more accurate false alarm probability estimation than previous EVT methods."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7015331", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7015331", "pdfSize": "879KB"}, "title": "Threshold determination for dynamic programming based track-before-detect in passive bistatic radar", "displayText": "Xin Guan, Li-hua Zhong, Dong-hui Hu, Chi-biao Ding, \"Threshold determination for dynamic programming based track-before-detect in passive bistatic radar\", <em>Signal Processing (ICSP) 2014 12th International Conference on</em>, pp. 1938-1943, 2014, ISSN 2164-5221.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7573061", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7573061", "pdfSize": "468KB"}, "title": "A Radiation Accumulation Based Detection Algorithm for Rectilinear-Motion Infrared Dim Target with Constant Acceleration", "displayText": "Tianlei Ma, Zelin Shi, Baoshu Xu, Jian Yin, Yunpeng Liu, \"A Radiation Accumulation Based Detection Algorithm for Rectilinear-Motion Infrared Dim Target with Constant Acceleration\", <em>Multimedia and Image Processing (ICMIP) 2016 First International Conference on</em>, pp. 23-27, 2016.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:47:36", "publisher": "IET", "title": "New analytical approach to detection threshold of a dynamic programming track-before-detect algorithm", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.036724S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "New analytical approach to detection threshold of a dynamic programming track-before-detect algorithm", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6582136/6582143", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
