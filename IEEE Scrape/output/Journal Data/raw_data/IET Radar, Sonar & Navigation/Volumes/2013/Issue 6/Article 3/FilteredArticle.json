The movement model of the slippery bistatic scattering centres of precessing targets and the wideband bistatic echo model are introduced firstly. The dynamic simulation method of the bistatic HRRPs of the precessing target is presented using the bistatic scattering coefficients obtained via electromagnetic calculations, and the simulation results validate the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the characteristics of the bistatic HRRP are analysed and show that the bistatic HRRP generally reflects the projection of the target onto the bisector of the bistatic angle, except that the bistatic angle is so wide that the bistatic HRRP is quite different from the monostatic HRRP. This research is helpful for imaging, and identifying precessing targets in the bistatic radar."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7089202", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7089202", "pdfSize": "670KB"}, "title": "Scattering Centers Induced by Creeping Waves on Cone-Shaped Targets in Bistatic Mode", "displayText": "Quan-You Qu, Kun-Yi Guo, Xin-Qing Sheng, \"Scattering Centers Induced by Creeping Waves on Cone-Shaped Targets in Bistatic Mode\", <em>Antennas and Propagation IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 63, pp. 3257-3262, 2015, ISSN 0018-926X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7326096", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326096", "pdfSize": "292KB"}, "title": "Feature extraction of wobbling rotational symmetry targets", "displayText": "Ai Xiaofeng, Li Yongzhen, Feng Dejun, Zhao Feng, Xiao Shunping, \"Feature extraction of wobbling rotational symmetry targets\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2015 IEEE International</em>, pp. 1626-1629, 2015.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7590589", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590589", "pdfSize": "908KB"}, "title": "Bistatic Micro-Doppler Characteristics of Precession Targets", "displayText": "Ai Xiaofeng, Zeng Yonghu, Zhao Feng, Liu Jin, Chen Jianan, \"Bistatic Micro-Doppler Characteristics of Precession Targets\", <em>Sensor Signal Processing for Defence (SSPD) 2016</em>, pp. 1-4, 2016.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T15:28:37", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Bistatic high range resolution profiles of precessing cone-shaped targets", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.036373S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Bistatic high range resolution profiles of precessing cone-shaped targets", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573679/6573682", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
