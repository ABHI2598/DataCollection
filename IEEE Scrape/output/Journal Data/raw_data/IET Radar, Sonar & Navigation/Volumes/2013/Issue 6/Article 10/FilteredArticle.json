One major problem limiting the high-resolution geosynchronous circular SAR (GEOCSAR) performances is the atmospheric effects including the tropospheric and ionospheric effects. In this study, the authors mainly consider the tropospheric effects on L-band GEOCSAR imaging. Since the integration time of GEOCSAR may be as long as 24 h, and the coverage can reach 1/3 of the Earth's surface, the effects of the spatial and temporal variation of the tropospheric refractive index cannot be ignored if well focused images are to be obtained. The analysis shows that the temporal variation of the tropospheric refractive index may cause severe degradation of the SAR images; the spatial variation of the refractive index and the tropospheric turbulence are not the important factor limiting the GEOCSAR imaging performance."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7055288", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7055288", "pdfSize": "1215KB"}, "title": "Advanced Radar Geosynchronous Observation System: ARGOS", "displayText": "Andrea Monti Guarnieri, Antoni Broquetas, Andrea Recchia, Fabio Rocca, Josep Ruiz-Rodon, \"Advanced Radar Geosynchronous Observation System: ARGOS\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 12, pp. 1406-1410, 2015, ISSN 1545-598X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7274327", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274327", "pdfSize": "4616KB"}, "title": "Adaptive Secondary Range Compression Algorithm in Geosynchronous SAR", "displayText": "Cheng Hu, Ye Tian, Tao Zeng, Teng Long, Xichao Dong, \"Adaptive Secondary Range Compression Algorithm in Geosynchronous SAR\", <em>Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 9, pp. 1397-1413, 2016, ISSN 1939-1404.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6812208", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6812208", "pdfSize": "1083KB"}, "title": "System Design for Geosynchronous Synthetic Aperture Radar Missions", "displayText": "Stephen Hobbs, Cathryn Mitchell, Biagio Forte, Rachel Holley, Boris Snapir, Philip Whittaker, \"System Design for Geosynchronous Synthetic Aperture Radar Missions\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 52, pp. 7750-7763, 2014, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7293606", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7293606", "pdfSize": "4234KB"}, "title": "Background Ionosphere Effects on Geosynchronous SAR Focusing: Theoretical Analysis and Verification Based on the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS)", "displayText": "Cheng Hu, Ye Tian, Xiaopeng Yang, Tao Zeng, Teng Long, Xichao Dong, \"Background Ionosphere Effects on Geosynchronous SAR Focusing: Theoretical Analysis and Verification Based on the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS)\", <em>Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 9, pp. 1143-1162, 2016, ISSN 1939-1404.", "order": "4"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T13:57:39", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Tropospheric effects on L-band geosynchronous circular SAR imaging", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.043906S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Tropospheric effects on L-band geosynchronous circular SAR imaging", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573679/6573689", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "4"}}
