The BPTRS is derived from the one-to-one relationship between slow time and Doppler frequency with no Taylor series expansions. Based on the BPTRS, a twodimensional frequency-domain focusing algorithm for spaceborne/airborne bistatic synthetic aperture radar is developed. The algorithm exploits a range-dependent sub-blocks processing method to perform range cell migration correction and quadratic Doppler term compensation, and then a scaled inverse Fourier transformation and a sinc interpolation are used to correct the geometric distortions in azimuth and range, respectively. Some simulation experiments are also presented to verify their performance."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T14:11:57", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Spaceborne/airborne bistatic synthetic aperture radar focusing on an analytical bistatic point target reference spectrum", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.014714S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Spaceborne/airborne bistatic synthetic aperture radar focusing on an analytical bistatic point target reference spectrum", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573679/6573680", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
