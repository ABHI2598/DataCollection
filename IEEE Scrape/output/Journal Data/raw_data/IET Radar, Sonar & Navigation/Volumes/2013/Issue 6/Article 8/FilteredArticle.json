The multi-constellation approach is a possible way to fill this gap. In this work GPS/GLONASS systems are combined and single point algorithm performance is assessed for different configurations in urban scenario. GLONASS is nearly fully operational and its inclusion guarantees satellite availability improvement, but the GPS/GLONASS multi-constellation use involves the addition, as further unknown, of the intersystem time-scale offset. The considered estimation techniques are Least Squares and Kalman filter. The first method uses only the measurement model, with the drawback of solution unavailability during GNSS outages. The last uses, in addition to a measurement model, a process model allowing the estimation of the unknowns in case of GNSS outage. To improve both methods performances aiding are considered on height and intersystem time scale offset. The main purposes of this work are the performance assessment of a multi-constellation system relative to GPS-only, adopting the aforesaid estimators, and the benefit evaluation of the aiding."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6923271", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923271", "pdfSize": "2420KB"}, "title": "A resolution enhancement technique for GNSS-R Delay Doppler Map", "displayText": "Domenico Schiavulli, Ferdinando Nunziata, Maurizio Migliaccio, Giovanni Pugliano, \"A resolution enhancement technique for GNSS-R Delay Doppler Map\", <em>Environmental Energy and Structural Monitoring Systems (EESMS) 2014 IEEE Workshop on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2014.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6934165", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6934165", "pdfSize": "2422KB"}, "title": "Asynchronous pseudolites and GNSS hybrid positioning", "displayText": "Ciro Gioia, Daniele Borio, \"Asynchronous pseudolites and GNSS hybrid positioning\", <em>Localization and GNSS (ICL-GNSS) 2014 International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-6, 2014, ISSN 2325-0771.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6947312", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6947312", "pdfSize": "480KB"}, "title": "A simulator for GNSS-R polarimetric observations over the ocean", "displayText": "Domenico Schiavulli, Ali Ghavidel, Adriano Camps, Maurizio Migliaccio, \"A simulator for GNSS-R polarimetric observations over the ocean\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2014 IEEE International</em>, pp. 3802-3805, 2014.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6577253", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6577253", "pdfSize": "431KB"}, "title": "Testing the test satellites: the Galileo IOV measurement accuracy", "displayText": "Antonio Angrisano, Salvatore Gaglione, Ciro Gioia, Daniele Borio, Joaquim Fortuny-Guasch, \"Testing the test satellites: the Galileo IOV measurement accuracy\", <em>Localization and GNSS (ICL-GNSS) 2013 International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-6, 2013, ISSN 2325-0771.", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7028060", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7028060", "pdfSize": "653KB"}, "title": "Dual GNSS systems positioning based on nonlinear filter and satellites selection in bad conditions", "displayText": "Fucheng Dai, Xuchu Mao, \"Dual GNSS systems positioning based on nonlinear filter and satellites selection in bad conditions\", <em>System Integration (SII) 2014 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on</em>, pp. 334-339, 2014.", "order": "5"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:24:38", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Performance assessment of aided Global Navigation Satellite System for land navigation", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.042851S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Performance assessment of aided Global Navigation Satellite System for land navigation", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573679/6573687", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "5"}}
