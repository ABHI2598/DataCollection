However, precise prior knowledge of target-radar orientation is usually difficult to obtain, whereas target impulse response is sensitive to target-radar orientation. Therefore that has become a barrier for the waveform design. In this study, the authors propose an eigensubspace projection-based method to enlarge the separation between the received echoes of different targets with additive coloured Gaussian noise, after analysing the upper bound on the error probability of multitarget recognition. Numerical results show that the proposed method is able to improve the recognition rates effectively."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:00:22", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Waveform design for wideband radar target recognition based on eigensubspace projection", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019162S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Waveform design for wideband radar target recognition based on eigensubspace projection", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573679/6573690", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
