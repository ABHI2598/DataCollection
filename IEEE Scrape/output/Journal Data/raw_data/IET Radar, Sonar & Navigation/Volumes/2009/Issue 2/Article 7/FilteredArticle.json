However, the problem of position finding in passive radar systems is somewhat different from the general case of sensor networks. Generally, in a passive radar system, there are few receivers located at short distances when compared with the it distance from the target. In this case, a problem known as geometric dilution of precision (GDP) occurs, which considerably increases the error of many proposed methods. This phenomenon can even make the position finding equations non-solvable. Regarding this fact, we have developed a least mean square error (LMSE) based method, which uses both the angle of arrival (AOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements to estimate almost precisely the position of very distant targets in a passive radar system. A simple equation is derived here to compare the TDOA and AOA accuracies. Then, it is shown that whenever the accuracies of these two measurements are comparable, the proposed method estimates the target position more precisely than the conventional AOA-only and TDOA-only methods. It also avoids the non-convergence behaviour encountered in TDOA-only methods."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6621849", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6621849", "pdfSize": "2370KB"}, "title": "Target Localization using Least Squares Estimation for MIMO Radars with Widely Separated Antennas", "displayText": "Mojtaba Dianat, Mohammad Reza Taban, Javad Dianat, Vahid Sedighi, \"Target Localization using Least Squares Estimation for MIMO Radars with Widely Separated Antennas\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 49, pp. 2730-2741, 2013, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7486220", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7486220", "pdfSize": "4630KB"}, "title": "Frequency-Only Radars and Other Frequency-Based Systems with Applications", "displayText": "Yilmaz Kalkan, \"Frequency-Only Radars and Other Frequency-Based Systems with Applications\", <em>Microwave Magazine IEEE</em>, vol. 17, pp. 26-52, 2016, ISSN 1527-3342.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7060381", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7060381", "pdfSize": "893KB"}, "title": "SAR processing To localize LPI radars", "displayText": "F.
