The method, called direct position determination (DPD), enables one to determine the emitter position in a single search operation. In formerly published articles on DPD, the signal was assumed to be a narrowband Gaussian source, which was subjected to a rather simple flat-fading channel model. Here, the authors extend the DPD algorithm to handle the OFDM signals that propagate through a frequency-selective channel, and derive the least squares estimator (LSE) for the problem. In addition, the authors present a method for a fine 2D position estimation, which enables one to reduce the DPD computational complexity without compromising on its estimation accuracy."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6151853", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6151853", "pdfSize": "2247KB"}, "title": "Wireless Positioning Using TDS-OFDM Signals in Single-Frequency Networks", "displayText": "Linglong Dai, Zhaocheng Wang, Changyong Pan, Sheng Chen, \"Wireless Positioning Using TDS-OFDM Signals in Single-Frequency Networks\", <em>Broadcasting IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 58, pp. 236-246, 2012, ISSN 0018-9316.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5505942", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5505942", "pdfSize": "398KB"}, "title": "Positioning with OFDM signals for the next- generation GNSS", "displayText": "Linglong Dai, Zhaocheng Wang, Jun Wang, Zhixing Yang, \"Positioning with OFDM signals for the next- generation GNSS\", <em>Consumer Electronics IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 56, 2010, ISSN 0098-3063.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6979218", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6979218", "pdfSize": "1093KB"}, "title": "Performance Analysis of Time of Arrival Estimation on OFDM Signals", "displayText": "Marco Driusso, Massimiliano Comisso, Fulvio Babich, Chris Marshall, \"Performance Analysis of Time of Arrival Estimation on OFDM Signals\", <em>Signal Processing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 22, pp. 983-987, 2015, ISSN 1070-9908.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7346273", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7346273", "pdfSize": "803KB"}, "title": "Investigation into distortion control in OFDM radar by spectral avoidance", "displayText": "S.R.
