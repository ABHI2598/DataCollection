The authors propose a two-dimensional pulse-to-pulse canceller (TDPC) that can make full use of such prior information. The more detailed formulations of the ground clutter model and the signal model are given in a matrix-vector form. The least-squares-typical cost function associated with the filter coefficient matrix of the TDPC is established on the basis of the ground clutter model and the signal model. Like the classical displaced phase centre antenna (DPCA) processing, the proposed TDPC is also a spatial-temporal suppressor of ground clutter and can decrease the ground clutter signals, even though the DPCA condition is not satisfied. The proposed TDPC can also be used as an efficient pre-filtering tool before the conventional moving target indication (MTI) processing and the classical adaptive processing. Moreover, if only the TDPC plus the conventional MTI is used, it takes less computational time than the adaptive canceller. Experimental results show that the proposed TDPC has the satisfactory ground clutter suppression capability by using both simulated data and measured data."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:22", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Two-dimensional pulse-to-pulse canceller of ground clutter in airborne radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.020193S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Two-dimensional pulse-to-pulse canceller of ground clutter in airborne radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4782973/4782977", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
