The DOAs of uncorrelated signals are first estimated using a new method of modified total least squares estimation of signal parameters via rotation invariance techniques. Afterwards, the contributions of uncorrelated signals are eliminated and a new matrix is constructed based on the spatial difference matrix. Then, the coherent signals can be resolved by performing the forward spatial smoothing scheme on the new matrix. The proposed method can resolve more signals than the array elements with good performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5957375", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5957375", "pdfSize": "338KB"}, "title": "Direction of Arrival Tracking under Various Degrees of Correlation", "displayText": "Sherif I.
