However, the CFA non-planar geometry induces clutter non-stationarity, resulting in elevated signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) loss when applying conventional space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms. Non-stationary clutter leads to covariance matrix estimation error and, consequently, an erroneous STAP frequency response. In this study, the authors examine two practical conformal antenna configurations: a belly-mounted canoe and a nose-mounted, chined shape. Using high-fidelity signal models, the authors show traditional STAP losses in excess of 10-dB because of the effects of clutter non-stationarity. The authors then investigate a number of ameliorating techniques compatible with standard STAP implementation, including localised processing, localised processing with time-varying weights, equivalent uniform linear array transformation, angle-Doppler warping and higher-order angle-Doppler warping. The authors demonstrate very good performance for the higher-order angle-Doppler warping method applied to the chined radome shape, with peak adaptive SINR losses reduced from nearly 16-dB for the uncompensated case to 3-dB of loss consistent with performance attainable in a homogeneous clutter environment. The authors also find good performance for three-dimensional angle-Doppler warping over azimuth, elevation and Doppler when applied to the tapered canoe shape, with uncompensated losses of roughly 14-dB reduced to 3-dB, again a level compatible with STAP applied in a homogeneous clutter environment. The authors thus show that CFA STAP can yield performance similar to that of a conventional planar array when using appropriate compensation methods."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5494603", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5494603", "pdfSize": "1553KB"}, "title": "Clutter properties for STAP with smooth and faceted cylindrical conformal antennas", "displayText": "Svante Bj\u00f6rklund, Tomas Boman, Anders Nelander, Svante Bj\u00f6rklund, \"Clutter properties for STAP with smooth and faceted cylindrical conformal antennas\", <em>Radar Conference 2010 IEEE</em>, pp. 315-320, 2010, ISSN 2375-5318.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6230203", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6230203", "pdfSize": "2040KB"}, "title": "A broadband phased array system with cylindrical conformal antenna", "displayText": "Dan Sun, Wenbin Dou, Xuequan Yan, \"A broadband phased array system with cylindrical conformal antenna\", <em>Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT) 2012 International Conference on</em>, vol. 3, pp. 1-3, 2012.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5656256", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656256", "pdfSize": "270KB"}, "title": "General clutter modeling for airborne radar", "displayText": "Wang Yong-liang, Xie Wen-chong, Duan Ke-qing, Zhang Xi-chuan, \"General clutter modeling for airborne radar\", <em>Signal Processing (ICSP) 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on</em>, pp. 2274-2278, 2010.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6586085", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6586085", "pdfSize": "399KB"}, "title": "Clutter-based array calibration for enhanced geolocation accuracy", "displayText": "Ryan K.
