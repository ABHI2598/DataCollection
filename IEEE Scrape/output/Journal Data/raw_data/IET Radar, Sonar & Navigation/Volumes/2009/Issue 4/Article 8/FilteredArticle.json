The statistics of the secondary data snapshots used to estimate the optimum weight vector are not identically distributed with respect to range, thus preventing the customary STAP processor from achieving its optimum performance. The compensation of the range dependence of the secondary data requires precise knowledge of the array response for any direction of arrival (DOA), and, thus, of the spatial steering vectors (SVs). The authors propose a novel registration-based range-dependence compensation algorithm that gives an accurate estimate of the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix under the hypotheses that calibrated spatial SVs are available only for a small set of DOAs, and that the errors in the model giving the true spatial SV for each DOA are DOA dependent. The performance in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio loss is promising."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5494603", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5494603", "pdfSize": "1553KB"}, "title": "Clutter properties for STAP with smooth and faceted cylindrical conformal antennas", "displayText": "Svante Bj\u00f6rklund, Tomas Boman, Anders Nelander, Svante Bj\u00f6rklund, \"Clutter properties for STAP with smooth and faceted cylindrical conformal antennas\", <em>Radar Conference 2010 IEEE</em>, pp. 315-320, 2010, ISSN 2375-5318.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:46:22", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Handling partially calibrated conformal antenna arrays in range&#2013;dependence compensation for airborne bistatic space&#2013;time adaptive processing radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.026478S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Handling partially calibrated conformal antenna arrays in range&#2013;dependence compensation for airborne bistatic space&#2013;time adaptive processing radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5210015/5210023", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
