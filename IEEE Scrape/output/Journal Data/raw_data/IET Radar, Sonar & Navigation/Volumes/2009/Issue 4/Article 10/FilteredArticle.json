Specifically, the aim is the automatic recognition of ship targets from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images. For this purpose a new two-step multi-feature based technique is proposed; this technique uses a number of features extracted from the ship radar image and matches these features with those extracted from the images obtained by properly projecting the target models of the classification library. Both cases of a priori known or unknown ship aspect angles are considered: the knowledge of the ship aspect (as available from tracking data) allows the selection of the candidate models on the basis of the matching between the ship and the model length, thus resulting in a performance improvement. Moreover, both single- and multi-frame-based processing techniques are proposed in order to assess the performance improvement achievable when an increasing number of ISAR images are involved in the decision; the fusion strategy adopted for the exploitation of the information from the multiple images is also described. The performance of the overall proposed technique is deeply investigated against simulated data. Results of its application to a set of live ISAR images of a ship target are also provided showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7497261", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7497261", "pdfSize": "452KB"}, "title": "The preliminary survey of ship recognition algorithms using ISAR images", "displayText": "Anna Kurowska, \"The preliminary survey of ship recognition algorithms using ISAR images\", <em>Radar Symposium (IRS) 2016 17th International</em>, pp. 1-4, 2016, ISSN 2155-5753.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6586123", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6586123", "pdfSize": "1494KB"}, "title": "Multistatic passive ISAR based on geostationary satellites for coastal surveillance", "displayText": "Fabrizio Turin, Debora Pastina, \"Multistatic passive ISAR based on geostationary satellites for coastal surveillance\", <em>Radar Conference (RADAR) 2013 IEEE</em>, pp. 1-6, 2013, ISSN 1097-5659.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7272825", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272825", "pdfSize": "2065KB"}, "title": "Efficient classification of ISAR images using 2d fourier transform and polar mapping", "displayText": "Sang-hong Park, Joo-ho Jung, Si-ho Kim, Kyung-tae Kim, \"Efficient classification of ISAR images using 2d fourier transform and polar mapping\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 51, pp. 1726-1736, 2015, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6523065", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6523065", "pdfSize": "1995KB"}, "title": "Moving Target Analysis in ISAR Image Sequences With a Multiframe Marked Point Process Model", "displayText": "Csaba Benedek, Marco Martorella, \"Moving Target Analysis in ISAR Image Sequences With a Multiframe Marked Point Process Model\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 52, pp. 2234-2246, 2014, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7053018", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7053018", "pdfSize": "743KB"}, "title": "Research and application of variant granularity feedback recognition method based on maximal entropy and cloud-membership", "displayText": "Keqiong Chen, Jianping Wang, Weitao Li, Chenghui Zhu, Bo Li, \"Research and application of variant granularity feedback recognition method based on maximal entropy and cloud-membership\", <em>Intelligent Control and Automation (WCICA) 2014 11th World Congress on</em>, pp. 1944-1949, 2014.", "order": "5"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6699032", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6699032", "pdfSize": "1683KB"}, "title": "Maritime automated targets recognition algorithm test bed for high resolution ISAR imagery", "displayText": "Patrick L.
