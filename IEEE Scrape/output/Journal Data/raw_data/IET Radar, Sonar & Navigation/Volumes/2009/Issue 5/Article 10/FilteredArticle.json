The proposed new waveform maintains narrow pulses and high PRF even at the long-range mode. Range ambiguity is mitigated by periodic `yes`no` coding of the transmitted pulse train. Using narrow pulses improves the range resolution and reduces the radial dimension of the illuminated clutter."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6162275", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6162275", "pdfSize": "1329KB"}, "title": "Inter-pulse coding and coherent-on-receive modifications of magnetron-based marine radar &#x2013; experimental results", "displayText": "Erez Ben-Yaacov, Daniel Quartler, Nadav Levanon, \"Inter-pulse coding and coherent-on-receive modifications of magnetron-based marine radar &#x2013; experimental results\", <em>Microwaves Communications Antennas and Electronics Systems (COMCAS) 2011 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-9, 2011.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T15:16:17", "publisher": "IET", "title": "New waveform design for magnetron-based marine radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.025366S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "New waveform design for magnetron-based marine radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5260390/5260400", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
