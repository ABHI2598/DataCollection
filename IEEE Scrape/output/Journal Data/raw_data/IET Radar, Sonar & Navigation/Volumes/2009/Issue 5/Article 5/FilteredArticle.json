For stepped frequency (SF) radar, the Doppler modulation is coupled with the stepped carrier frequency. It shifts and smears the high-resolution range profile and makes it difficult to analyse and extract the micro-motion information from the range profile directly. The authors propose to comprehend the SF radar as a special pulse Doppler radar, and the range profile as a Doppler profile for the convenience of motion analysis. The signature of moving targets for SF radar is analysed from this point of view and the equivalent instantaneous Doppler frequency (EIDF) is introduced. Then, a typical micro-motion, rotation, is taken as an example. The sinusoidal vibration of the peaks in the range profile sequence is explained in detail, especially the relationship between the sinusoid parameters and the rotation parameters. An approach to extract the rotation parameters from the range profile or EIDF spectrum sequence is proposed based on the Hough transform. Simulated and experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and the feature extraction method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6166878", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6166878", "pdfSize": "1035KB"}, "title": "Micromotion Parameter Estimation of Free Rigid Targets Based on Radar Micro-Doppler", "displayText": "Peng Lei, Jinping Sun, Jun Wang, Wen Hong, \"Micromotion Parameter Estimation of Free Rigid Targets Based on Radar Micro-Doppler\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 50, pp. 3776-3786, 2012, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6159625", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6159625", "pdfSize": "151KB"}, "title": "HRRP synthesizing in presence of observation data loss: A new way", "displayText": "Rong Fan, Qun Wan, Hongzhi Zhu, \"HRRP synthesizing in presence of observation data loss: A new way\", <em>Radar (Radar) 2011 IEEE CIE International Conference on</em>, vol. 1, pp. 654-657, 2011.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:18:44", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Analysis and extraction of stepped frequency radar signature for micro-motion structure", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.03479S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analysis and extraction of stepped frequency radar signature for micro-motion structure", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5260390/5260395", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
