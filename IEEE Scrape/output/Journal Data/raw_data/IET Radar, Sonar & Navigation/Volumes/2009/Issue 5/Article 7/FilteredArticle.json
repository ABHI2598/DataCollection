The clutter spectra not only vary severely with range, but also vary with bistatic configuration. The problem of range dependence is more serious in monostatic airborne radar. In this paper, the geometry of arbitrary bistatic airborne radar configuration is firstly analysed, and a formula for Doppler frequency calculation with the variables of azimuth angle and bistatic range is deduced, which is an efficient tool for bistatic clutter analysis. Because of the severe clutter range dependence, the processing of compensation is indispensable in space time adaptive processing (STAP). However, when range ambiguity occurs, the compensation is difficult to be applied to each clutter range cell. To solve this problem, a range ambiguity resolving approach is further proposed by utilising azimuth elements in phased array. Because this approach will result in spatial degrees of freedom (DOF) loss, the overlapped subarray processing is introduced in order obtain enough spatial DOF for STAP. By doing so, the compensation for mitigating range dependence can be applied effectively to bistatic clutter."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7535724", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7535724", "pdfSize": "903KB"}, "title": "Resolving range ambiguity in long baseline synchronous acoustic positioning", "displayText": "Yan Wang, Qing Li, Jin Fu, Guolong Liang, \"Resolving range ambiguity in long baseline synchronous acoustic positioning\", <em>Ocean Acoustics (COA) 2016 IEEE/OES China</em>, pp. 1-5, 2016.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6663908", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663908", "pdfSize": "727KB"}, "title": "Robust space-time interpolation in presence of antenna element error for bistatic airborne radar", "displayText": "Liu Jinhui, Liao Guisheng, \"Robust space-time interpolation in presence of antenna element error for bistatic airborne radar\", <em>Signal Processing Communication and Computing (ICSPCC) 2013 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-3, 2013.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T14:27:17", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Bistatic clutter analysis and range ambiguity resolving for space time adaptive processing", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.033833S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Bistatic clutter analysis and range ambiguity resolving for space time adaptive processing", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5260390/5260397", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
