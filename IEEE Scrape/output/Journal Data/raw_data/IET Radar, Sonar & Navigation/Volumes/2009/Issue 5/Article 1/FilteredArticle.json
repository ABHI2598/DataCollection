The planar-plus-an-isolated array geometry, first defined by Li <i>et al.</i> (1996) is adopted. The authors propose to replace the planar pressure-sensors in Li <i>et al.</i> (1996) by electromagnetic vector sensors, thus exploiting the benefits inherent in the additional measurements made by a vector sensor. Compared with the algorithm in Li <i>et al.</i> (1996), the presently proposed algorithm can offer closed-form automatically paired azimuth-elevation angle estimates, without costly 2D iterative searching. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can achieve the unambiguous direction estimates with enhanced accuracy by setting the planar electromagnetic vector sensors to space much farther apart than a half-wavelength. Therefore the proposed algorithm constitutes a distinct improvement over (Li <i>et al.</i>, 1996)."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5937301", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937301", "pdfSize": "2791KB"}, "title": "Coherent Source Localization: Bicomplex Polarimetric Smoothing with Electromagnetic Vector-Sensors", "displayText": "Xiao-Feng Gong, Zhi-Wen Liu, You-Gen Xu, \"Coherent Source Localization: Bicomplex Polarimetric Smoothing with Electromagnetic Vector-Sensors\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 47, pp. 2268-2285, 2011, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T16:11:15", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Computationally efficient two-dimensional direction-of-arrival estimation of electromagnetic sources using the propagator method", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.026728S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Computationally efficient two-dimensional direction-of-arrival estimation of electromagnetic sources using the propagator method", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5260390/5260391", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
