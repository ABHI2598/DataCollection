By assuming some hypotheses that translate to some restrictions in the maritime surveillance scenario, a signal model for the phase history is derived. This function is calculated here using phase gradient autofocus and can be related to the pitch motion of the ship, which may consequently be estimated. The amplitude and the period of this pitch estimate allow us to select imaging times at which the ISAR images are descriptive for classification purposes. The cross-range scaling of these images is also achieved. Simulated data are used to validate the technique and to evaluate its performance when deviations from the nominal scenario are present. Results obtained with live data acquired by a high-resolution radar confirm the effectiveness of the approach."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5682042", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5682042", "pdfSize": "1393KB"}, "title": "Three-Dimensional Target Geometry and Target Motion Estimation Method Using Multistatic ISAR Movies and Its Performance", "displayText": "Kei Suwa, Toshio Wakayama, Masafumi Iwamoto, \"Three-Dimensional Target Geometry and Target Motion Estimation Method Using Multistatic ISAR Movies and Its Performance\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 49, pp. 2361-2373, 2011, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6237589", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6237589", "pdfSize": "7573KB"}, "title": "Experimental Performance Analysis of Distributed Target Coherent Radar Detectors", "displayText": "Javier Carretero-Moya, Antonio De Maio, Javier Gismero-Menoyo, Alberto Asensio-Lopez, \"Experimental Performance Analysis of Distributed Target Coherent Radar Detectors\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 48, pp. 2216-2238, 2012, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7812891", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7812891", "pdfSize": "1718KB"}, "title": "Three-dimensional aircraft isar imaging based on shipborne radar", "displayText": "Yicheng Jiang, Sibo Sun, Yeshu Yuan, Tat Soon Yeo, \"Three-dimensional aircraft isar imaging based on shipborne radar\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 52, pp. 2504-2518, 2016, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T15:12:25", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Pitch estimation for non-cooperative maritime targets in ISAR scenarios", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.032888S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Pitch estimation for non-cooperative maritime targets in ISAR scenarios", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5260390/5260399", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
