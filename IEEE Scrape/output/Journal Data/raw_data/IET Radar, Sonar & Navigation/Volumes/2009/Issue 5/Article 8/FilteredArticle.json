However, if the parameters of stepped-frequency (SF) radar (such as single pulse bandwidth, frequency step size and sampling instant) are not prudently designed, `ghost image` phenomenon (also called range ambiguity in some literature) will corrupt the synthetic HRR profiles. The relationship between parameters of the SF radar and the ghost images is provided analytically. A new synthetic range profiling algorithm is developed to generate HRR profiles without ghost images by using the least-squares (LS) estimation. For targets with negligible radial velocities, the new LS profiling algorithm can eliminate the ghost images successfully, and introduces less signal-to-noise ratio loss. With this algorithm, the restriction on the frequency step size is less rigid than the traditional unambiguous criterion. Consequently, a higher range resolution could be obtained. Simulations and field experimental results are also presented."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5473138", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5473138", "pdfSize": "213KB"}, "title": "Velocity Estimation and Range Shift Compensation for High Range Resolution Profiling in Stepped-Frequency Radar", "displayText": "Yimin Liu, Huadong Meng, Gang Li, Xiqin Wang, \"Velocity Estimation and Range Shift Compensation for High Range Resolution Profiling in Stepped-Frequency Radar\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 7, pp. 791-795, 2010, ISSN 1545-598X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6849991", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6849991", "pdfSize": "3688KB"}, "title": "Fundamental Limits of HRR Profiling and Velocity Compensation for Stepped-Frequency Waveforms", "displayText": "Yimin Liu, Tianyao Huang, Huadong Meng, Xiqin Wang, \"Fundamental Limits of HRR Profiling and Velocity Compensation for Stepped-Frequency Waveforms\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 62, pp. 4490-4504, 2014, ISSN 1053-587X.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5960695", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5960695", "pdfSize": "555KB"}, "title": "Extended range profiling in stepped-frequency radar with sparse recovery", "displayText": "Yang Hu, Yimin Liu, Huadong Meng, Xiqin Wang, \"Extended range profiling in stepped-frequency radar with sparse recovery\", <em>Radar Conference (RADAR) 2011 IEEE</em>, pp. 1046-1049, 2011, ISSN 1097-5659.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6129624", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6129624", "pdfSize": "4331KB"}, "title": "High Range Resolution Profile of Simulated Aircraft Wake Vortices", "displayText": "Jianbing Li, Xuesong Wang, Tao Wang, Jun Li, Shunping Xiao, Zhongxun Liu, \"High Range Resolution Profile of Simulated Aircraft Wake Vortices\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 48, pp. 116-129, 2012, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6850187", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6850187", "pdfSize": "1263KB"}, "title": "Cognitive random stepped frequency radar with sparse recovery", "displayText": "Tianyao Huang, Yimin Liu, Huadong Meng, Xiqin Wang, \"Cognitive random stepped frequency radar with sparse recovery\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 50, pp. 858-870, 2014, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "5"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T15:17:23", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Eliminating ghost images in high-range resolution profiles for stepped-frequency train of linear frequency modulation pulses", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.051939S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Eliminating ghost images in high-range resolution profiles for stepped-frequency train of linear frequency modulation pulses", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5260390/5260398", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "5"}}
