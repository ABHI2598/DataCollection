A signal model is developed to account for both code diverse MIMO (c-MIMO) and frequency diverse MIMO (f-MIMO), and a general framework on performance evaluation is presented to take into account various waveform configurations including phased array (PA), partially correlated MIMO and ideally orthogonal MIMO. The proposed framework evaluates the system performance through optimum processing (OP) gain and transmit array (TA) gain. The OP gain is in turn evaluated by the number of available space-time measurements (ASMs) that depends on the number of clutter degrees of freedom (clutter NDoF) relative to the system degrees of freedom (system NDoF). The waveform diversity introduced by MIMO, especially f-MIMO, could significantly enhance the OP gain by increasing the number of ASMs. Hence, in OP-gain-limited scenarios, where the overall performance significantly degrades despite the TA gains, the preferable configuration in terms of optimum performance would be ordered as f-MIMO, c-MIMO, and last, PA, that is, no MIMO."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5960647", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5960647", "pdfSize": "604KB"}, "title": "Target models and waveform design for detection in MIMO radar", "displayText": "Jun Tang, Bo Tang, Lizhong Zheng, \"Target models and waveform design for detection in MIMO radar\", <em>Radar Conference (RADAR) 2011 IEEE</em>, pp. 798-803, 2011, ISSN 1097-5659.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5656256", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656256", "pdfSize": "270KB"}, "title": "General clutter modeling for airborne radar", "displayText": "Wang Yong-liang, Xie Wen-chong, Duan Ke-qing, Zhang Xi-chuan, \"General clutter modeling for airborne radar\", <em>Signal Processing (ICSP) 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on</em>, pp. 2274-2278, 2010.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:55:14", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Models and performance evaluation for multiple-input multiple-output space-time adaptive processing radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.033581S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Models and performance evaluation for multiple-input multiple-output space-time adaptive processing radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5332148/5332150", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
