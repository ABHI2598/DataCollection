Here we use the order statistic theory to obtain alternative expressions for the detection probability and the false-alarm rate of the S-CFAR in homogeneous background. They are not bulky and thus are easy to calculate for the thresholding parameters."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:08:08", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Comments on 'constant false-alarm rate algorithm based on test cell information'", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018754S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Comments on 'constant false-alarm rate algorithm based on test cell information'", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5332148/5332158", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
