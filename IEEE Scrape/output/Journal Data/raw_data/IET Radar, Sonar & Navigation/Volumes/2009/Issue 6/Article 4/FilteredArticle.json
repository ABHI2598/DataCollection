It is shown, through full-field simulation, that for a given absorber, the inclusion of impedance loading can reduce the frequency at which a -40-dB reflectivity level is obtained from 6 to 2 GHz. Oblique incidence and variable tolerancing are also discussed."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:11:12", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Optimisation of a pyramidal geometric transition radar absorbing material loaded with a resistive frequency selective surface", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.023568S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Optimisation of a pyramidal geometric transition radar absorbing material loaded with a resistive frequency selective surface", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5332148/5332152", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
