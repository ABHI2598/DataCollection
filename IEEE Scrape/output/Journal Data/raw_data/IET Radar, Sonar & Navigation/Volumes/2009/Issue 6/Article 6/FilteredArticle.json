India is also developing one such system popularly known as GPS aided geo augmented navigation (GAGAN) system. Modelling of ionospheric effects is one of the major challenges in developing precise and reliable GAGAN. The high values of total electron content (TEC), the large diurnal and seasonal variability and intense irregularities present in the low-latitude ionosphere, lead to unacceptable positional errors in GAGAN service region. Todd Walter <i>et al.</i> of Stanford University, USA have made significant contribution in the area of SBAS ionospheric grid modelling by developing the popularly known planar fit model. It is reported by Walter <i>et al.</i> (2000) that a constant decorrelation value of 35 cm was proposed over the wide area augmentation system (WAAS) service region. To provide accurate estimation of ionospheric delays at user ionospheric pierce points (IPP) during a storm or intense irregularities, an irregularity detector and a decorrelation adaptor are incorporated in the modelling. As planar fit model is not adequate to model intense irregularities of Indian ionosphere, a modified planar fit model is applied for GAGAN data on similar lines as was done for WAAS and the results are encouraging."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7210187", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210187", "pdfSize": "1480KB"}, "title": "Modeling of Ionospheric Time Delay Using Anisotropic IDW With Jackknife Technique", "displayText": "V.
