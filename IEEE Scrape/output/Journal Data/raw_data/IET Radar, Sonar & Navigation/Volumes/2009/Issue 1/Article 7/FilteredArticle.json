Variations in the distance to the target cause circular shifts of the received signal, and most of the classification algorithms are very sensitive to shifts over the input signal. This fact makes the alignment of each signal prior to any classification stage very important. Here the alignment of noisy signals using the zero phase method is studied. In order to evaluate the performance of the alignment method, a theoretical analysis of the sensitivity to noise of this alignment method is carried out. As a result, an analytical expression that predicts the error of the alignment method is obtained. The validity of this expression is also confirmed by experimental results. A database of high-range resolution radar profiles containing patterns belonging to six different targets has been used, and a comparative study of the sensitivity to noise estimated using the profiles of the database and predicted by the analytical expression is carried out. The results demonstrate that the proposed analytical expression is useful to analyse the sensitivity to noise of the zero-phase alignment method for medium and high signal-to-noise ratio values."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T12:34:22", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Statistical analysis of the zero-phase method for aligning noisy high-resolution radar signals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.023579S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Statistical analysis of the zero-phase method for aligning noisy high-resolution radar signals", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4723699/4723706", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
