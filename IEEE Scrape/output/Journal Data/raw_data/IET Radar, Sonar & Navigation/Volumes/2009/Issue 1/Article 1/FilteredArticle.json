A spoofer transmits GNSS-like signals to a navigation receiver and may cause a significant position deviation in navigation computation. Although GNSS receivers can be equipped with certain receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) schemes to provide fault detection and isolation functions, it is possible that the misleading information because of spoofers may enter a GNSS receiver without being detected. As spoofers may inject erroneous pseudo-range measurements to the navigation receiver with a false message, it is important to assess the spoofing effect on the resulting position. An optimisation approach is adopted to determine the worst-case misleading message and the resulting position deviation. A vulnerability index against spoofing is defined for the assessment of the position deviation in a spoofed environment."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7444141", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7444141", "pdfSize": "2033KB"}, "title": "Overview of Spatial Processing Approaches for GNSS Structural Interference Detection and Mitigation", "displayText": "Ali Broumandan, Ali Jafarnia-Jahromi, Saeed Daneshmand, G&#x00E9;rard Lachapelle, \"Overview of Spatial Processing Approaches for GNSS Structural Interference Detection and Mitigation\", <em>Proceedings of the IEEE</em>, vol. 104, pp. 1246-1257, 2016, ISSN 0018-9219.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7444116", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7444116", "pdfSize": "1643KB"}, "title": "Robust GNSS Receivers by Array Signal Processing: Theory and Implementation", "displayText": "Carles Fern&#x00E1;ndez-Prades, Javier Arribas, Pau Closas, \"Robust GNSS Receivers by Array Signal Processing: Theory and Implementation\", <em>Proceedings of the IEEE</em>, vol. 104, pp. 1207-1220, 2016, ISSN 0018-9219.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T15:34:52", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Analysis of global navigation satellite system position deviation under spoofing", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.026921S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analysis of global navigation satellite system position deviation under spoofing", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4723699/4723700", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
