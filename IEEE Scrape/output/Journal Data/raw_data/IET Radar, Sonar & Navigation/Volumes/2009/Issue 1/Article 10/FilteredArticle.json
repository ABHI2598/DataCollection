Instead of a direct use of the classic PASTd algorithm in the RR-STAP, which suffers from a slow convergence rate because of the sequential tracking of multiple clutter eigenvectors, a modified PASTd adapted to the STAP is presented. In comparison with the conventional eigenvalue decomposition approach, the presented algorithm is computationally much more efficient and is also able to achieve comparable convergence effectiveness. The presented methodology is validated by the Monte Carlo simulation."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6568071", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6568071", "pdfSize": "802KB"}, "title": "A spatial spectrum estimation algorithm based on adaptive beamforming nulling", "displayText": "Yong J.
