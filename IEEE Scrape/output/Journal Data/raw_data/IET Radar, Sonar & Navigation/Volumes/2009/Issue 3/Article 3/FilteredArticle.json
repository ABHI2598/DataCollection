They are time-varying because the Doppler frequency shifts of sea echoes are simultaneously modulated by the velocity components projected from the unavoidably different motions of both platforms, which is more complex than its counterpart in the monostatic mode. The geometrical relation is used to obtain the received signal model: strong first-order sea clutter interferences and submerged ship targets with constant and non-constant speeds are considered as mixed-order multicomponent polynomial-phase signals (mc-PPSs) and both second-order sea clutter continuum and atmospheric noise as additive noise. Then, a scheme based on the product high-order ambiguity function is proposed to extract the targets; it is a recursive procedure in which the first-order sea clutter is removed by an existing time-space cascaded filtering method. Monte Carlo simulations show the validity and efficiency of the proposed scheme."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:26:09", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Extraction of mixed-order multicomponent ship target signals from broadened sea clutter in bistatic shipborne surface wave radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019911S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Extraction of mixed-order multicomponent ship target signals from broadened sea clutter in bistatic shipborne surface wave radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5071501/5071504", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
