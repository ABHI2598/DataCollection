Two forms, with an approximation of extracting the range dependence and an accurate iterative solution, as well as their respective focusing methods, that is the approximated solution method and the iterative solution method are presented here. The range-Doppler method is extended to the TI configuration of BISAR. Imaging simulation of the point targets and comparison with the bistatic backprojection method shows the feasibility of these methods as well as their merits and demerits."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7468462", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7468462", "pdfSize": "3542KB"}, "title": "Iterative ADMM for Inverse FE&#x2013;BI Problem: A Potential Solution to Radio Tomography of Asteroids", "displayText": "Huan Su, Feng Xu, Shuai Lu, Ya-Qiu Jin, \"Iterative ADMM for Inverse FE&#x2013;BI Problem: A Potential Solution to Radio Tomography of Asteroids\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 54, pp. 5226-5238, 2016, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4578822", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4578822", "pdfSize": "3125KB"}, "title": "Imaging Simulation of Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar and Its Polarimetric Analysis", "displayText": "Feng Xu, Ya-Qiu Jin, \"Imaging Simulation of Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar and Its Polarimetric Analysis\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 46, pp. 2233-2248, 2008, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:50:12", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Raw signal processing of stripmap bistatic synthetic aperture radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.028448S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Raw signal processing of stripmap bistatic synthetic aperture radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5071501/5071506", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
