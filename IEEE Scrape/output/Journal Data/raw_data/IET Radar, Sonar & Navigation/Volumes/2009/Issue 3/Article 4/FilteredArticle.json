The TDF, called the angle density function, is studied by utilising the angular distribution of targets at a fixed range. Active sensor imaging based on the angle density function is achieved using a phased array radar system. The phased array system is arranged for stationary radar-stationary target configuration. The imaging algorithm is applied for the whole target area. Instead of pointwise imaging, an approach including the whole target area globally is developed. An advantage of the technique is the use of standard Fourier-based analysis. This makes it possible to use of simple functions for global radar imaging. Although the imaging is accomplished by way of the phased array radars, beamforming is not necessary with the proposed technique."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-07-14T10:14:26", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Angle density functions for active sensor imaging", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.021429S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Angle density functions for active sensor imaging", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5071501/5071505", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
