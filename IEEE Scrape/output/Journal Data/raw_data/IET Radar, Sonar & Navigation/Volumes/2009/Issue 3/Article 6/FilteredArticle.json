Second-order properties of output of the correlation receiver are evaluated and an approximate Cramer-Rao bound on errors of Doppler measurement is derived. The accuracy of Doppler measurements is found to be affected by the following factors: power spectral density of noise signal, frequency response of the low-pass filter in correlator, observation time, velocity of the target and signal to noise ratio. It is shown that the random nature of the transmitted signal induces additional fluctuations at the output of correlator which limit the accuracy even in the infinite signal to noise case. Qualitative extension of the results to a case covering multiple targets and clutter is made. It is argued that the performance will decrease and that increasing transmitted power may not provide significant improvement when clutter is present."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6129668", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6129668", "pdfSize": "2191KB"}, "title": "Processing of Noise Radar Waveforms using Block Least Mean Squares Algorithm", "displayText": "Michal Meller, Stanislaw Tujaka, \"Processing of Noise Radar Waveforms using Block Least Mean Squares Algorithm\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 48, pp. 749-761, 2012, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7073528", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073528", "pdfSize": "684KB"}, "title": "Through-the-wall detection of human activities using a noise radar with microwave quadrature correlator", "displayText": "Waldemar Susek, Bronislaw Stec, \"Through-the-wall detection of human activities using a noise radar with microwave quadrature correlator\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 51, pp. 759-764, 2015, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5494508", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5494508", "pdfSize": "672KB"}, "title": "Some aspects of designing real-time digital correlators for noise radars", "displayText": "Micha&#x142; Meller, \"Some aspects of designing real-time digital correlators for noise radars\", <em>Radar Conference 2010 IEEE</em>, pp. 821-825, 2010, ISSN 2375-5318.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4976926", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976926", "pdfSize": "354KB"}, "title": "Block Least Mean Squares processing of noise radar waveforms", "displayText": "Michal Meller, Stanislaw Tujaka, \"Block Least Mean Squares processing of noise radar waveforms\", <em>Radar Conference 2009 IEEE</em>, pp. 1-6, 2009, ISSN 1097-5659.", "order": "4"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T14:43:41", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Approximate Cramer-Rao bound on Doppler error in correlation-processing relatively narrowband noise radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.030537S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Approximate Cramer-Rao bound on Doppler error in correlation-processing relatively narrowband noise radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5071501/5071507", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "4"}}
