The CWT allows to analyse two-dimensional SAR images to highlight the frequency and angular behaviour of the scatterers. This technique allows to build a SAR hyperimage, that is, a four-dimensional data cube which represents for each spatial location (x, y) of the scatterer in the image, its frequency and angular energy behaviour. When analysing different targets, objects or areas in SAR images, it has been recently observed that some scatterers belonging to a same class of objects could have similar frequency and angular energy responses. The previous observations have motivated the determination to exploit these energy responses to discriminate these objects. This discrimination is performed by frequency and angular correlations between the response of a particular scatterer (measured) and those of all the scatterers in the SAR image. Some examples of discrimination from real SAR data are presented and show an interest of the method for target classification and recognition for SAR imaging"}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6977915", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977915", "pdfSize": "3222KB"}, "title": "Urban Area SAR Image Man-Made Target Extraction Based on the Product Model and the Time&#x2013;Frequency Analysis", "displayText": "Wenjin Wu, Huadong Guo, Xinwu Li, \"Urban Area SAR Image Man-Made Target Extraction Based on the Product Model and the Time&#x2013;Frequency Analysis\", <em>Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 8, pp. 943-952, 2015, ISSN 1939-1404.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5417407", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5417407", "pdfSize": "241KB"}, "title": "Supervised classification by neural networks using polarimetric time-frequency signatures", "displayText": "M.
