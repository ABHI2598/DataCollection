The system is based on a supervised approach that uses augmented reality (AR) images for training computer added detection and classification (CAD/CAC) algorithms, which are then deployed on real data. The algorithms are able to generalise and detect real targets when trained on AR ones, with performances comparable with the state-of-the-art in CAD/CAC. To illustrate the approach, the focus is on one specific algorithm, which uses Bayesian decision and the novel, purpose-designed central filter feature extractors. Depending on how the training database is partitioned, the algorithm can be used either for detection or classification. Performance figures for these two modes of operation are presented, both for synthetic and real targets. Typical results show a detection rate of more that 95% and a false alarm rate of less than 5%. The proposed supervised approach can be directly applied to train and evaluate other learning algorithms and data representations. In fact, a most important aspect is that it enables the use of a wealth of legacy pattern recognition algorithms for the sonar CAD/CAC applications of target detection and target classification"}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7472026", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7472026", "pdfSize": "600KB"}, "title": "Improving resolution in supervised patch-based target detection", "displayText": "Ron Amit, Gal Mishne, Ronen Talmon, \"Improving resolution in supervised patch-based target detection\", <em>Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2016 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1994-1998, 2016, ISSN 2379-190X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6729126", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729126", "pdfSize": "3910KB"}, "title": "Fast Target Detection in Synthetic Aperture Sonar Imagery: A New Algorithm and Large-Scale Performance Analysis", "displayText": "David P.
