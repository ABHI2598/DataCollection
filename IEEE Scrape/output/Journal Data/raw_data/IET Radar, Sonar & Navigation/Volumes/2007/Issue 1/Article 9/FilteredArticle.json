Although the formulation and the theoretical derivations presented in their work are indeed correct, the analysis of the proposed bound and the conclusions that follow are wrong. Here, a correct analysis is presented with the key observation that [as opposed to the claim made in the work of Ristic et al. (2004)], the proposed CRLB reflects the interaction between the targets, even if their motion is independent. The multi-target CRLB is also compared with the error performance of a multi-target state maximum likelihood estimator; a remarkable agreement is observed for high signal-to-noise ratio"}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4408173", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4408173", "pdfSize": "166KB"}, "title": "Integrated detection and tracking of multiple objects with a network of acoustic sensors", "displayText": "Branko Ristic, Sanjeev Arulampalam, \"Integrated detection and tracking of multiple objects with a network of acoustic sensors\", <em>Information Fusion 2007 10th International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-7, 2007.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4560217", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4560217", "pdfSize": "5058KB"}, "title": "Performance measure for Markovian switching systems using best-fitting Gaussian distributions", "displayText": "M.
