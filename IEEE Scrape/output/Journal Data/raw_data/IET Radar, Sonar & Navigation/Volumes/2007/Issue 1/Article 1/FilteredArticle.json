Here, the problem of target range estimation and ambiguity resolving is converted to the problem of static multiple models estimation and decision. Frequency and pseudo-range measurements are used to update each model of the target with the probabilistic data association and tracking filter. The method to select the PRF used to detect the target is also suggested according to the state estimates of the survived models. Simulation results demonstrate the improved accuracy and convergence when compared with the conventional methods"}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6914435", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6914435", "pdfSize": "183KB"}, "title": "Gaussian mixture measurement model for high pulse-repetition frequency radar tracking in clutter", "displayText": "Yi Fang Shi, Darko Mu&#x0161;icki, Tae Han Kim, Taek Lyul Song, \"Gaussian mixture measurement model for high pulse-repetition frequency radar tracking in clutter\", <em>Electronics Information and Communications (ICEIC) 2014 International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-2, 2014.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:26:16", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Multiple models track algorithm for radar with high pulse-repetition frequency in frequency-modulated ranging mode", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.03568S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Multiple models track algorithm for radar with high pulse-repetition frequency in frequency-modulated ranging mode", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4119395/4119396", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
