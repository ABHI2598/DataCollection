With this comes a corresponding increase in complexity of determining the performance of the sensor, with focus shifting from simple signal detection theory to assess the capability for automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms to discriminate between different objects based on the shape of the projected acoustic shadows on the seafloor. This paper uses information theory to place bounds on the performance of ATR algorithms which use features based on an object's shadow as a classification cue. Information is used to compute different bounds on the performance of any classification method. The technique is applied to a simple classification task namely to discriminate between circular and square shapes. The effect of sensor characteristics, such as contrast and resolution, are computed. An example is given where the bounds on performance for a sidescan sonar with given characteristics under some environmental conditions are computed. The performance is then analysed as a function of the shapes being classified by changing the circular shape to a superellipse. Although high-frequency imaging sonar is examined here, the method could be applied to other types of monochromatic imagery that contains multiplicative noise."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6107881", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107881", "pdfSize": "1084KB"}, "title": "Use of small imaging sonars for diver identification", "displayText": "Anna Crawford, Aaron Percival, Vance Crowe, \"Use of small imaging sonars for diver identification\", <em>Technologies for Homeland Security (HST) 2011 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 262-266, 2011.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6907832", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6907832", "pdfSize": "589KB"}, "title": "Area coverage planning that accounts for pose uncertainty with an AUV seabed surveying application", "displayText": "Liam Paull, Mae Seto, Howard Li, \"Area coverage planning that accounts for pose uncertainty with an AUV seabed surveying application\", <em>Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2014 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 6592-6599, 2014.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5475293", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5475293", "pdfSize": "696KB"}, "title": "A Template Matching Procedure for Automatic Target Recognition in Synthetic Aperture Sonar Imagery", "displayText": "Vincent Myers, John Fawcett, \"A Template Matching Procedure for Automatic Target Recognition in Synthetic Aperture Sonar Imagery\", <em>Signal Processing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 17, pp. 683-686, 2010, ISSN 1070-9908.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5170758", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5170758", "pdfSize": "314KB"}, "title": "ISAR Target 2D Images Pre-processing in ATR", "displayText": "Xinggan Zhang, Yechao Bai, \"ISAR Target 2D Images Pre-processing in ATR\", <em>Computer Science and Information Engineering 2009 WRI World Congress on</em>, vol. 6, pp. 542-544, 2009.", "order": "4"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T14:10:44", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Bounding the performance of sidescan sonar automatic target recognition algorithms using information theory", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.037671S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Bounding the performance of sidescan sonar automatic target recognition algorithms using information theory", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4267617/4267620", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "4"}}
