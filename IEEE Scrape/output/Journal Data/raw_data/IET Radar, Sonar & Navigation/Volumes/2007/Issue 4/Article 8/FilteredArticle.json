Most of the existing methods are based on quadratic time-frequency (TF) distributions, which, however, yield a number of outliers in the cases of low SNRs. In this paper, we construct a new family of TF distributions, namely, the joint distributions, to estimate the IF curves in order to reduce outliers in the cases of low SNRs. The construction of the joint distributions is based on the definition of the directionally smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distributions (DSPWVD) and pointwise adaptive weight averaging of a bank of DSPWVDs with different directions. The segments of the IF curve whose directions are close to that of the DSPWVD can be highlighted by each DSPWVD and the entire IF curve will be enhanced by the joint TF distribution. Simulation results show that the IF estimator based on the joint distributions outperforms that using quadratic TF distributions and the adaptive optimal adaptive kernel distribution in the cases of low SNRs."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5657076", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5657076", "pdfSize": "294KB"}, "title": "Filter design for linear frequency modulation signal based on fractional Fourier transform", "displayText": "Yan Zhe, Wang Hongting, Wu Ligang, Fan Fei, Zhao Hong, \"Filter design for linear frequency modulation signal based on fractional Fourier transform\", <em>Signal Processing (ICSP) 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on</em>, pp. 251-254, 2010.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6923829", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923829", "pdfSize": "225KB"}, "title": "Instantaneous magnitudes and frequencies of signals with positivity constraints", "displayText": "Wei-Chao Kuang, Bingo Wing-Kuen Ling, Charlotte Yuk-Fan Ho, Zhijing Yang, Qingyun Dai, \"Instantaneous magnitudes and frequencies of signals with positivity constraints\", <em>Communication Systems Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP) 2014 9th International Symposium on</em>, pp. 222-226, 2014.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7394589", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7394589", "pdfSize": "150KB"}, "title": "A novel digital frequency de-hopper using bandpass sampling technique", "displayText": "Muhammad Zeeshan, Shoab Ahmed Khan, \"A novel digital frequency de-hopper using bandpass sampling technique\", <em>Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO) 2015 9th International Conference on</em>, pp. 739-743, 2015.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:54:22", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Instantaneous frequency estimation based on directionally smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution bank", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.037847S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Instantaneous frequency estimation based on directionally smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution bank", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4267617/4267626", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
