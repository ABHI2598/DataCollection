Real radar targets however have complex geometry comprised of many scattering centres, and multiple interactions may occur between these. Therefore, the authors explore whether the PMS technique is still effective when applied to more realistic target geometries"}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7393475", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7393475", "pdfSize": "342KB"}, "title": "High-Resolution Range Profile Deception Method Based on Phase-Switched Screen", "displayText": "Letao Xu, Dejun Feng, Ran Zhang, Xuesong Wang, \"High-Resolution Range Profile Deception Method Based on Phase-Switched Screen\", <em>Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 15, pp. 1665-1668, 2016, ISSN 1536-1225.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T12:55:39", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Reflection of radar signals from multiple phase-modulated surfaces", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.028143S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reflection of radar signals from multiple phase-modulated surfaces", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4197511/4197519", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
