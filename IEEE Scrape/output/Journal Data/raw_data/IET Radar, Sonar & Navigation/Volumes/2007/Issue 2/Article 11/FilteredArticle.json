Thus, it will be possible to detect cars and measure their speed from the acquired along track interferometric data. The development of vehicle-detection algorithms requires the knowledge of the radar signatures of vehicles, especially under consideration of the geometry of the radar look direction and the vehicle orientation. The radar signatures of the non-moving cars are presented. They are estimated experimentally from airborne E-SAR multi-frequency and polarimetric data, which have been collected during a flight campaign in 2003. Radar signatures are estimated for a considerable part of aspect angles ranging from 0deg to 180deg. The large synthetic aperture length of the E-SAR radar sensor allows the look processing of data and therefore allows an increase of the aspect angle resolution. The radar signature analysis for one type of passenger cars showed that the largest radar cross-section values and thus the greatest chance for high probability of detection are for cars standing in rear and front views of radar beam direction. This holds true for all frequencies and co-polarisations. Radar cross-section values for cross-polarisations and diagonal views are much lower and are therefore less suitable for car detection. The radar signature profile over a considerable range of aspect angles in fine resolution can be used further for the verification of simulation studies and for the performance prediction for traffic monitoring with a coming German TerraSAR-X satellite"}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7065350", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7065350", "pdfSize": "2240KB"}, "title": "A 3D Simulation Model for Experimental Analysis from Moving Target Detection and Localization Using UWB Radar System", "displayText": "N.T.
