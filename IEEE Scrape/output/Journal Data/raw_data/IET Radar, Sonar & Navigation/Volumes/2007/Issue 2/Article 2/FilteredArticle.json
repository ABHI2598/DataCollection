However, after the implementation of the Galileo system in a few years, there will be more satellites in view for the user to utilise together with GPS satellites, and a combination of them will bring better performance for RAIM. On the other hand, with the help of wide area augmentation system and the use of dual-frequency operation, pseudo-range errors will be reduced greatly. Thus, tighter alert limits are required for RAIM, and formerly `small' errors should not be neglected. All of those factors make it necessary to consider simultaneous multiple-satellite faults. A detailed theoretical analysis of RAIM under the condition of two-satellite faults for both vertical and horizontal directions is presented. The characteristic/max slopes for every pair of satellites are then deduced in order to calculate the tighter vertical/horizontal protection level for RAIM"}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7546152", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7546152", "pdfSize": "736KB"}, "title": "A Novel RAIM Scheme in Single Constellation Based on Receiver Clock Auxiliary", "displayText": "Fanchen Meng, Siyuan Tan, Shan Wang, Bocheng Zhu, \"A Novel RAIM Scheme in Single Constellation Based on Receiver Clock Auxiliary\", <em>Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN) 2015 International Conference on</em>, pp. 543-547, 2015, ISSN 2472-7555.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4724789", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724789", "pdfSize": "264KB"}, "title": "An Improved RAIM Algorithm Based on the Total Least Squares", "displayText": "Chuansen Yang, Xiaohao Xu, Ruihua Liu, Hongsheng Zhao, \"An Improved RAIM Algorithm Based on the Total Least Squares\", <em>Computational Intelligence and Security 2008.
