The radar frequency, grazing angle, azimuth angle, water wavelength, wave steepness and the breaking wave strength were all varied systematically. The velocity of the peak Doppler power spectral density was found to depend on the phase velocity of the breaking wave in the radar line of sight, but was independent of the radar frequency. The spectral width depended on the phase velocity of the wave, but not on the grazing angle used. The peak Doppler power and radar cross-section of the breaking waves was found to scale with the radar wavelength (proplambda<sub>r</sub> <sup>1.5</sup>)"}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7346250", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7346250", "pdfSize": "192KB"}, "title": "Modeling of sea spike events with generalized extreme value distribution", "displayText": "Hao Ding, Yong Huang, Ningbo Liu, Yonghua Xue, Guoqing Wang, \"Modeling of sea spike events with generalized extreme value distribution\", <em>Radar Conference (EuRAD) 2015 European</em>, pp. 113-116, 2015.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7373603", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7373603", "pdfSize": "3147KB"}, "title": "Multichannel Analysis and Suppression of Sea Clutter for Airborne Microwave Radar Systems", "displayText": "Valeria Gracheva, Joachim Ender, \"Multichannel Analysis and Suppression of Sea Clutter for Airborne Microwave Radar Systems\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 54, pp. 2385-2399, 2016, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T13:52:05", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Measurements of the Doppler spectra of breaking waves", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.032878S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Measurements of the Doppler spectra of breaking waves", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4197511/4197520", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
