The rationale behind this requirement is that this additional capability greatly enhances the utility of military and commercial systems. Two approaches to improving the dynamic range of modern radar and surveillance receivers are described: (1) linearisation of intermodulation distortion (IMD) using digital post-distortion algorithms and (2) linearisation of IMD using frequency retranslation mixer (FRM). The experimental results presented illustrate that the digital post-distortion and FRM approaches are effective in providing IMD improvements for the hardware and test scenarios measured. The improvements measured ranged from 15 to 35 dB for narrowband signals to 2-6 dB for frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) wideband signals. The digital post-distortion approach provided the greatest performance improvement when the input signals were between the analogue-to-digital converter full range and 20 dB below that level. The improvements measured for the FRM linearisation approach ranged from 20 to 25 dB for the narrowband two-tone tests and 16-18 dB for the wideband FMCW signal chirps."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5605172", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5605172", "pdfSize": "2389KB"}, "title": "Broadband signal search and direction finding at UHF frequencies", "displayText": "Volkan Turgul, Meltem Dirim, Sukru B.
