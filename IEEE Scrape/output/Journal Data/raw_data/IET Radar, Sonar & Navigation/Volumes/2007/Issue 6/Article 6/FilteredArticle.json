Superresolution processing can discriminate signals at separations much less than the beamwidth or conventional Doppler bin width (or conversely, achieve a given minimum resolvable separation with a smaller array or less time-on-target). Simulation results and analysis of real radar data presented here show at least a 2-fold improvement compared with conventional processing, assuming simple theoretical gain manifolds. A novel polarisation-sensitive superresolution algorithm applicable to skywave HF radar is also discussed."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-08-22T19:14:19", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Superresolution for high-frequency radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018903S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Superresolution for high-frequency radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4405563/4405569", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
