Data are presented showing that there is a transient coherence in the long-term fluctuations of the clutter, which locally appears to show the single periodic fluctuation of a dominant wave, but when averaged over a large area is seen to contain a wide band of fluctuation frequencies. This apparently non-stationary behaviour makes it difficult to predict the local sea clutter level for constant false alarm rate (CFAR) thresholding using conventional techniques. A new method of scan-to-scan CFAR processing is therefore proposed, which takes account of this behaviour. The scheme is analysed and its performance characterised."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7494170", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7494170", "pdfSize": "13995KB"}, "title": "New synthesis time accumulation sea spike restraint method", "displayText": "Xujin Yuan, Xiaofeng Yuan, \"New synthesis time accumulation sea spike restraint method\", <em>Electronic Measurement & Instruments (ICEMI) 2015 12th IEEE International Conference on</em>, vol. 01, pp. 265-269, 2015.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6682294", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682294", "pdfSize": "489KB"}, "title": "The Decorrelation Time Accumulation Restrain Method for Sea Clutter Spike", "displayText": "Xujin Yuan, Yong Chen, Chao Wang, Hongcheng Yin, \"The Decorrelation Time Accumulation Restrain Method for Sea Clutter Spike\", <em>Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) 2013 IEEE and Internet of Things (iThings/CPSCom) IEEE International Conference on and IEEE Cyber Physical and Social Computing</em>, pp. 1576-1579, 2013.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T15:36:24", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Sea clutter transient spatial coherence and scan-to-scan constant false alarm rate", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.0297S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Sea clutter transient spatial coherence and scan-to-scan constant false alarm rate", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4405563/4405568", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
