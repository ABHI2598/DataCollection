A software simulation has been developed to allow assessment of netted radar sensitivity and ambiguity properties in both two-and three-dimensional space. Simulation results demonstrate that coherent netted radar sensitivity depends not only on the radar parameters, but also on the numbers, locations and specification of transmit and receive nodes. The netted radar ambiguity function is affected by a combination of many factors. In addition to those that determine the form of the monostatic ambiguity function, the locations of transmit and receive nodes as well as the position and velocity of the target all are shown to play an important role in evaluating system performance. As a result of these dependencies, it is shown that there is severe degradation of range and Doppler resolution when a target crosses sufficiently close to a transmit-receive baseline."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7311315", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7311315", "pdfSize": "367KB"}, "title": "Ambiguity function for multistatic radar systems with orthogonal frequency waveforms", "displayText": "Lei Pengzheng, Huang Xiaotao, \"Ambiguity function for multistatic radar systems with orthogonal frequency waveforms\", <em>Waveform Diversity & Design Conference (WDD) 2012 International</em>, pp. 151-154, 2012.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6784855", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6784855", "pdfSize": "182KB"}, "title": "The evaluation of embattle project of netted radar based on oppositional effectiveness", "displayText": "Liang Chen, Peng Zou, \"The evaluation of embattle project of netted radar based on oppositional effectiveness\", <em>Conference Anthology IEEE</em>, pp. 1-5, 2013.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4976946", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976946", "pdfSize": "997KB"}, "title": "MIMO radar limitations in clutter", "displayText": "G.
