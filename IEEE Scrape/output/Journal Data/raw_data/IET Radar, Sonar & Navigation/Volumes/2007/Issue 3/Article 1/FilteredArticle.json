One essential characteristic of the vehicle trajectory is its deceleration when it reaches dense atmospheric layers. The intensity of the phenomenon is proportional to a scalar, called the ballistic coefficient. This leads to an highly nonlinear time-varying dynamic. To understand the dimensioning parameters for estimating the ballistic coefficient, accurate approximations of the Fisher information matrix are developed. The main result is a closed-form expression of a lower bound for the variance of the ballistic coefficient estimate."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-07-14T10:14:25", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Estimating the ballistic coefficient of a re-entry vehicle", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.02167S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Estimating the ballistic coefficient of a re-entry vehicle", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4225360/4225361", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
