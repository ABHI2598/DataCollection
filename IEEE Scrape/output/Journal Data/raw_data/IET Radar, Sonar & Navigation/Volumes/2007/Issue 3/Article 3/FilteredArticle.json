The conventional approach to image rejection in RF receivers is to employ a front-end RF tuner before downconversion to the intermediate frequency. As DOA processing employs a separate receiver channel for each array element, an RF tuner would be needed behind each element. Clearly for scanned systems at microwave frequencies, this is not a viable option where the tuners would generally have to be implemented in RF hardware. The need for RF tuners can be eliminated by downconversion down to baseband and employing I&amp;Q mixers, which provide an intrinsic image rejection capability. Unfortunately, such a solution requires two analog-to-digital (A/D) converters per array element. An alternative approach is to use image rejection mixers in which case only one A/D converter per array element is needed. The approach also requires only one A/D per array element but achieves the image rejection through a DSP implementation. As a result, use of relatively expensive image rejection mixers is avoided without sacrificing performance. Experimental results are presented that validate the theoretical predictions."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:17:14", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Image frequency suppression in frequency-scanned direction-of-arrival estimation systems", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018299S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Image frequency suppression in frequency-scanned direction-of-arrival estimation systems", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4225360/4225363", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
