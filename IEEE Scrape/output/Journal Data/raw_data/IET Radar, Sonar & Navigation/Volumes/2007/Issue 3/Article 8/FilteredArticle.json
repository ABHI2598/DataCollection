The PAS using annihilating weights is shown to be free of signal cancellation [which occurs in the conventional spatial smoothing (SS) technique for uncorrelated sources] while effectively suppressing coloured noise with unknown Toeplitz covariance matrix, but may be incompetent for DOA estimation. The PAS technique is still shown to be more attractive than the SS scheme in a very difficult situation that the direct signals and the reflecting signals are of very close DOAs. The penalised Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz scheme is further suggested for more thorough source decorrelation with an L-shaped electromagnetic vector-sensor array to gain improved interference suppression. The analytical expression for the mean-squared error of DOA estimates obtained from the weight-PAS pre-processed root-multiple signal classification is derived and analysed. A hybrid DOA estimator incorporating PAS and integrating some existing techniques is also described. Numerical results are finally given."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5967658", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5967658", "pdfSize": "1753KB"}, "title": "Cram&#x00E9;r-rao bound of the direction-of-arrival estimation using a spatially spread electromagnetic vector-sensor", "displayText": "Xin Yuan, \"Cram&#x00E9;r-rao bound of the direction-of-arrival estimation using a spatially spread electromagnetic vector-sensor\", <em>Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP) 2011 IEEE</em>, pp. 1-4, 2011, ISSN pending.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5937301", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5937301", "pdfSize": "2791KB"}, "title": "Coherent Source Localization: Bicomplex Polarimetric Smoothing with Electromagnetic Vector-Sensors", "displayText": "Xiao-Feng Gong, Zhi-Wen Liu, You-Gen Xu, \"Coherent Source Localization: Bicomplex Polarimetric Smoothing with Electromagnetic Vector-Sensors\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 47, pp. 2268-2285, 2011, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5595021", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5595021", "pdfSize": "680KB"}, "title": "&#x201C;Vector Cross-Product Direction-Finding&#x201D; With an Electromagnetic Vector-Sensor of Six Orthogonally Oriented But Spatially Noncollocating Dipoles/Loops", "displayText": "Kainam Thomas Wong, Xin Yuan, \"&#x201C;Vector Cross-Product Direction-Finding&#x201D; With an Electromagnetic Vector-Sensor of Six Orthogonally Oriented But Spatially Noncollocating Dipoles/Loops\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 59, pp. 160-171, 2011, ISSN 1053-587X.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6900695", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6900695", "pdfSize": "423KB"}, "title": "Bicomplex-valued adaptive filtering with application to wind profile prediction", "displayText": "Xiaoming Gou, Zhiwen Liu, Zheyi Fan, Yougen Xu, \"Bicomplex-valued adaptive filtering with application to wind profile prediction\", <em>Digital Signal Processing (DSP) 2014 19th International Conference on</em>, pp. 404-408, 2014, ISSN 2165-3577.", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4737232", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737232", "pdfSize": "448KB"}, "title": "Minimum variance beamforming using polarization sensitive array", "displayText": "Muhammad Ishtiaq Ahmad, Zhiwen Liu, Yougen Xu, \"Minimum variance beamforming using polarization sensitive array\", <em>Communication Systems 2008.
