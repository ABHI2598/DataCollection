The proposed technique not necessary to predesign the acceleration levels according to the target manoeuver properties. The manoeuver input is esitmated using the difference between the non-manoeuvering filter and the manoeuvering one. To compensate the estimation error, the fuzzy gain is used to describe the relationship between the filter residual and its variation. A fuzzy system is utilised for an universal approximator. It is optimised by using a genetic algorithm. A computer simulations show that the effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with multiple filters."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:06:30", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Intelligent tracking algorithm for manoeuvering target using Kalman filter with fuzzy gain", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.021673S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Intelligent tracking algorithm for manoeuvering target using Kalman filter with fuzzy gain", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4225360/4225369", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
