The paper explores statistical estimation techniques based on the maximum likelihood criterion and Gibbs sampling, and addresses concerns about the accuracy of the measurements delivered thereby. In particular, the Gibbs approach can deliver joint measurements (and the associated covariances) from both targets, and it is therefore natural to consider a joint filter. The ideas are compared, and among the various strategies discussed, a particle filter that operates directly on the monopulse measurements seems to be the best."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T13:53:09", "publisher": "IET", "title": "MCMC methods for tracking two closely spaced targets using monopulse radar channel signals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.021831S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "MCMC methods for tracking two closely spaced targets using monopulse radar channel signals", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4225360/4225367", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
