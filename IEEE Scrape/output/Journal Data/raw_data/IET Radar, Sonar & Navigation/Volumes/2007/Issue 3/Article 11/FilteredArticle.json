It is a well-known fact that radar range resolution is a constant parameter unrelated to the detection range. This is because range resolution is dependent on the transmitted and received signal. At the same time, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is dependent on the detection range. For example, at a distance of half the maximum detection range, the SNR increases by 12 dB from that of the maximum detection range and at one-fourth the distance, it increases by 24 dB."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-07-14T10:14:27", "publisher": "IET", "title": "REPLY TO COMMENTS - REPLY TO THE COMMENT ON \"MULTI-RANGE-RESOLUTION RADAR USING SIDEBAND SPECTRUM\"", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019658S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "REPLY TO COMMENTS - REPLY TO THE COMMENT ON \"MULTI-RANGE-RESOLUTION RADAR USING SIDEBAND SPECTRUM\"", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4225360/4225371", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
