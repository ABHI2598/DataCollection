Some EW receivers receive radar pulses, measure the parameter of each pulse received and group the pulses that belongs to the same emitter together to determine the radar parameters for each emitter. These parameters are then compared with values stored for known radar types, to identify the emitter type. Two parts are focused, emitters deinterleaving and PRF-type identification. The deinterleaving is done through parameters clustering. Two parameters are selected for clustering direction of arrival and radio frequency. A self-organising neural network called Fuzzy ART is proposed for clustering. This algorithm has a very good clustering quality and can run in real-time applications.The PRF-type identification is done through time-of-arrival (TOA) analysis. Three previously presented algorithms are combined in new scheme to do the TOA analysis (or PRF-type identification). These algorithms are difference TOA histogram, TOA folding histogram and sequence search algorithm. The complete proposed system has been tested using three different tests. These tests are simple PRI test, jittered PRI test and staggered PRI test. The proposed system identifies up to 90 simple emitters, 20 jittered emitters and 20 staggered emitters. In all tests, the data were simulated and generated using software."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5960608", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5960608", "pdfSize": "693KB"}, "title": "A mutual information-based time-frequency atom extraction algorithm for radar emitter recognition", "displayText": "Jingyao Liu, Huadong Meng, Yimin Liu, Xiqin Wang, \"A mutual information-based time-frequency atom extraction algorithm for radar emitter recognition\", <em>Radar Conference (RADAR) 2011 IEEE</em>, pp. 602-605, 2011, ISSN 1097-5659.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6830709", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6830709", "pdfSize": "372KB"}, "title": "Performance evaluation of self organizing neural networks for clustering in ESM systems", "displayText": "Kenan Gencol, Hakan Tora, \"Performance evaluation of self organizing neural networks for clustering in ESM systems\", <em>Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU) 2014 22nd</em>, pp. 2233-2236, 2014.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5226342", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226342", "pdfSize": "395KB"}, "title": "Parade: A versatile parallel architecture for accelerating pulse train clustering", "displayText": "Amin Ansari, Dan Zhang, Scott Mahlke, \"Parade: A versatile parallel architecture for accelerating pulse train clustering\", <em>Application Specific Processors 2009.

De-interleaving the stream of received pulses may include forming clusters of pulses having similar parameter values around anchor points, where each cluster is defined by a window around its anchor point. The dimensions of each window may be determined by a weighted distance, i.e., a measure of dissimilarity, calculated using weights. Each weight may depend inversely on the measurement error in the parameter with which the weight is associated. Each anchor point may have a set of weights adjusted to its parameter values, and which may change as operating conditions change. The weights may be determined using a method including a calibration step, which may include injecting pulses with known parameters into the receiver (12).", "title": "Method for de-interleaving received radar pulses using dynamically updated weights", "patentNumber": "9063210", "filingDate": "01 June 2012", "grantDate": "23 June 2015", "ipcClasses": ["G01S0070200000", "G01S0072920000", "G01S0138700000"], "assignees": ["RAYTHEON CO"], "inventors": "Hammack, George D.", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US9063210.pdf", "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9063210.PN.&OS=PN/9063210"}], "lastupdate": "2016-05-07T16:01:57", "isEarlyAccess": false, "publisher": "IET", "title": "Deinterleaving of radar signals and PRF identification algorithms", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.045085S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Deinterleaving of radar signals and PRF identification algorithms", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4299454/4299456", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "6"}}
