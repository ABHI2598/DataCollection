The approach serves as an alternative to the costly Monte Carlo simulation method. In MTT, evaluation of interference among multiple targets remains a crucial issue on tracking performance study. This issue is investigated in dense target scenarios with feature information and unrestrictive motion. Analytic expressions are developed for tracking performance in terms of the probability of correct association and estimation accuracy. Feature information of targets is incorporated in the formulation which provides us an insight on how the tracking performance is impacted by features. In the derivations, a series of simplification assumptions are made and the results are not intended to be used directly in practical tracking applications. The major contribution of the paper is to provide a theoretical exploration and a methodology for analytic performance prediction of MTT."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7272840", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272840", "pdfSize": "1270KB"}, "title": "Looking behind a corner using multipath-exploiting UWB radar", "displayText": "Rudolf Zetik, Marcus Eschrich, Snezhana Jovanoska, Reiner S.
