First, the receiving signal model is established in multipath environment based on the complex reflection coefficient model. Then the decorrelating efficiency of polarisation smoothing (PS) is presented by analysing the condition number of envelop covariance matrix by PS. After that, the PS-MUSIC algorithm which combines the PS preprocessing and the MUSIC algorithm is established. Its performances, in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio, elevation angle of target and polarisation angle, are evaluated by simulations. The PS-MUSIC algorithm needs only a few snapshots or even a single one. This method can work well in a narrow band system and is not restrained by array configuration. It can also be applied in other scenarios, where multipath effect is serious."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:45", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Low-angle tracking algorithm using polarisation sensitive array for very-high frequency radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018848S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Low-angle tracking algorithm using polarisation sensitive array for very-high frequency radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985829", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
