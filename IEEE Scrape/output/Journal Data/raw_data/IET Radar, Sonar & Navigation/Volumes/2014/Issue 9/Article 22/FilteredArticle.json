The target echoes are all assumed to come from the same direction. However, the exact direction is unknown a priori. Precisely, the signal steering vector lies in a certain known subspace, but with unknown coordinate. They derive the Wald test and two-step Wald test and also show that there is no meaningful Rao test or its two-step variation. Moreover, it is found that the two-step Wald test is equivalent to an existing direction detector. Additionally, it is shown that the Wald test possesses the constant false alarm rate property. Some numerical examples are given to compare the detection performance of the novel direction detector with its counterparts, both in the cases of matched and mismatched signals."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7230411", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230411", "pdfSize": "209KB"}, "title": "Generalized direction detectors in sample-starved environments", "displayText": "Weijian Liu, Wei Zhang, Hongli Li, Chen Zhang, Yongliang Wang, Jun Liu, \"Generalized direction detectors in sample-starved environments\", <em>Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP) 2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on</em>, pp. 296-299, 2015.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:47", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Detection of a distributed target with direction uncertainty", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.026154S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Detection of a distributed target with direction uncertainty", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985794", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
