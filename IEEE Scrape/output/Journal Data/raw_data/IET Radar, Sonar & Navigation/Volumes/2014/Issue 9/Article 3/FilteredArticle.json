Here, an efficient clutter suppression approach is presented to improve STAP performance. Utilising the characteristics of clutter, the near-range clutter, the major reason for the performance degradation, is extracted from raw returns using a specially designed oblique projector firstly, and then is mitigated by an adaptive beamformer estimated from the extracted components. Subsequently, an azimuth-Doppler STAP beamformer is employed to further suppress the residual clutter. To enhance the robustness of the approach, a simple steering vector calibration technique is taken into account. The proposed approach can eliminate the near-range clutter effectively, and therefore alleviate the clutter range dependence greatly. The STAP performance can be improved significantly. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:40", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Clutter suppression approach for non-sidelooking airborne radar with medium pulse repetition frequency", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.021913S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Clutter suppression approach for non-sidelooking airborne radar with medium pulse repetition frequency", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985882", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
