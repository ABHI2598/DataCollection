During recent years, much progress has been made in order to deal with unfavourable data conditions and to further enhance the achievable resolutions. Since TomoSAR has essentially be seen as a spectral estimation problem in the context of array signal processing, most of the methods investigated until now rely on a relatively large tomographic aperture and a relatively high number of receiving antennas in order to be able to separately reconstruct scatterers below the Rayleigh resolution limit. In contrast to that, this study proposes a maximum-likelihood-based approach for tomographic SAR inversion, which provides a better height resolution than conventional array signal processing approaches even if the number of antennas or the overall baseline size is limited. The algorithm is tested on real multi-baseline SAR data acquired over an urban area by an airborne single-pass four-antenna system operating in the millimetre-wave domain. First results show the feasibility of the method both with respect to 3D scatterer reconstruction and 3D SAR focusing."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6946340", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6946340", "pdfSize": "8933KB"}, "title": "Generating point clouds of forested areas from airborne millimeter wave InSAR data", "displayText": "Michael Schmitt, Uwe Stilla, \"Generating point clouds of forested areas from airborne millimeter wave InSAR data\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2014 IEEE International</em>, pp. 1-4, 2014.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7305787", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305787", "pdfSize": "3106KB"}, "title": "Analysis of a Maximum Likelihood Phase Estimation Method for Airborne Multibaseline SAR Interferometry", "displayText": "Christophe Magnard, Max Frioud, David Small, Thorsten Brehm, Erich Meier, \"Analysis of a Maximum Likelihood Phase Estimation Method for Airborne Multibaseline SAR Interferometry\", <em>Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 9, pp. 1072-1085, 2016, ISSN 1939-1404.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6914287", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6914287", "pdfSize": "14208KB"}, "title": "Towards the recognition of individual trees in decimeter-resolution airborne millimeterwave SAR", "displayText": "Uwe Stilla, Michael Schmitt, Oliver Maksymiuk, Stefan Auer, \"Towards the recognition of individual trees in decimeter-resolution airborne millimeterwave SAR\", <em>Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing (PRRS) 2014 8th IAPR Workshop on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2014.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6946349", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6946349", "pdfSize": "452KB"}, "title": "A new phase unwrapping approach using mutually correlated multi-baseline interferograms", "displayText": "Fabio Baselice, Giampaolo Ferraioli, Vito Pascazio, Gilda Schirinzi, \"A new phase unwrapping approach using mutually correlated multi-baseline interferograms\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2014 IEEE International</em>, pp. 37-40, 2014.", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7147797", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147797", "pdfSize": "2874KB"}, "title": "Phase Inconsistencies and Multiple Scattering in SAR Interferometry", "displayText": "Francesco De Zan, Mariantonietta Zonno, Paco L&#x00F3;pez-Dekker, \"Phase Inconsistencies and Multiple Scattering in SAR Interferometry\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 53, pp. 6608-6616, 2015, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "5"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7368107", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7368107", "pdfSize": "1369KB"}, "title": "Demonstration of Single-Pass Millimeterwave SAR Tomography for Forest Volumes", "displayText": "Michael Schmitt, Xiao Xiang Zhu, \"Demonstration of Single-Pass Millimeterwave SAR Tomography for Forest Volumes\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 13, pp. 202-206, 2016, ISSN 1545-598X.", "order": "6"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7729030", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729030", "pdfSize": "9739KB"}, "title": "Forest remote sensing on the individual tree level by airborne millimeterwave SAR", "displayText": "Michael Schmitt, Muhammad Shahzad, Xiao Xiang Zhu, \"Forest remote sensing on the individual tree level by airborne millimeterwave SAR\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2016 IEEE International</em>, pp. 151-154, 2016, ISSN 2153-7003.", "order": "7"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:44", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Maximum-likelihood-based approach for single-pass synthetic aperture radar tomography over urban areas", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.065692S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Maximum-likelihood-based approach for single-pass synthetic aperture radar tomography over urban areas", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985834", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "7"}}
