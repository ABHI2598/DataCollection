In this study, the authors propose a clutter covariance matrix estimation algorithm using multi-polarised data in the polarimetric radar system, which can mitigate this problem with an enlarged training sample set. Based on the space-time signal model, they validate that the clutter snapshots for different polarisations share a common spectral structure theoretically. Then, the maximum likelihood estimations of clutter covariance matrixes with multi-polarised training samples are deduced under Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistic. Finally, the performance improvement of our method with limited training samples is demonstrated with simulated data."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:41", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Clutter space-time covariance matrix estimate based on multi-polarised data", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.01503S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Clutter space-time covariance matrix estimate based on multi-polarised data", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985777", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
