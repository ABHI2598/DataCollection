The design options for the system are presented and justified, and the required signal processing steps are summarised. Special attention is then devoted to the critical issue of target association. A slow-time feature, video time density function, is proposed to associate target responses in different receiver channels. Video time density function is extracted from range-Doppler video sequences for each target. It indicates the slow-time evolution characteristic of the moving human targets, and thus is invariant to radar observation angles (provided that the target can be detected). Auction algorithm-based global nearest neighbour approach is extended to the measurement-to-measurement association between receivers. The decentralised tracking approach proposed is experimentally verified on measured data."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7491979", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7491979", "pdfSize": "982KB"}, "title": "Human micro-Doppler signature extraction in the foliage-penetration environment", "displayText": "Jun Zhang, Tian Jin, Yuan He, Lei Qiu, Zhimin Zhou, \"Human micro-Doppler signature extraction in the foliage-penetration environment\", <em>Microwave Radar and Wireless Communications (MIKON) 2016 21st International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-5, 2016.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:42", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Decentralised tracking for human target in multistatic ultra-wideband radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.031594S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Decentralised tracking for human target in multistatic ultra-wideband radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985865", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
