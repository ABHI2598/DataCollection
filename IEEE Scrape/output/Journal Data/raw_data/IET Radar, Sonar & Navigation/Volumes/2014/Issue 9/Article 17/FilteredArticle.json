The method of statistical linearisation of the non-linear discrimination characteristic of time discriminator was used to analyse the accuracy of steady-state range measurements, and mathematical relationships were obtained. The influence of input noise on the linearisation of discrimination characteristics was explored. The mathematical relationships and findings presented in this study are confirmed by the results of simulation and allow establishment of the optimal parameters of range finders."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:39", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Analysis of non-linear properties of digital radar range finders using statistical linearisation method", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018101S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analysis of non-linear properties of digital radar range finders using statistical linearisation method", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985831", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
