ISR system usually has large radio frequency (RF) power and antenna array size. The novel ISR introduced in this study has the advantages of low power consumption and continuous operation as it uses novel technologies. It can probe real time plasma parameters in the entire altitude range of the ionosphere (80-1000 km). Successful development of such an ISR will resolve the problem of continuous detection of ionospheric parameters. This study will introduce the design concept of this low power software defined ISR."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:42", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Low power software defined incoherent scatter radar system design concept for continuous sounding the earth's ionosphere", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.022515S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Low power software defined incoherent scatter radar system design concept for continuous sounding the earth's ionosphere", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985802", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
