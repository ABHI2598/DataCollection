Via integral quadratic constraints approach, the absolute stability conditions of the global positioning system carrier tracking loop aided by INS aiding Doppler estimator are derived in order to ensure reliable and robust navigation performance for practical engineering application. The performance of the third-order carrier tracking loop aided by the proposed INS aiding Doppler estimator was evaluated in the high dynamic flight trajectory and low carrier-to-noise ratio scenarios. It is shown that INS aiding Doppler estimator can increase the receiver's robustness in high dynamics when the proposed absolute stability conditions are satisfied."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:39", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Stability analysis of inertial navigation system-aided phase-lock-loop via an integral quadratic constraint approach", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018039S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Stability analysis of inertial navigation system-aided phase-lock-loop via an integral quadratic constraint approach", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985867", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
