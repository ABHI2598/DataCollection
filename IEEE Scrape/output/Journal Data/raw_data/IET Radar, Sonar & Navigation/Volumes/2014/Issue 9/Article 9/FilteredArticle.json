A well selected satellite combination can provide better positioning accuracy and lighter computational load. In this study, typical obstacle environments in urban areas and their effects on satellite selection are discussed. A distribution-free satellite selecting method is proposed. The main idea of this proposed method is to expand the selected satellite subset sequentially. The performance of the proposed methods is validated and compared with four other methods by simulation in typical scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed method is suitable for urban GNSS applications."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7560443", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7560443", "pdfSize": "195KB"}, "title": "Change of Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) for integrated system", "displayText": "Ao Yongcai, Zhang Bo, Zhou Baozhuo, Wang Shili, \"Change of Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) for integrated system\", <em>Information Technology Networking Electronic and Automation Control Conference IEEE</em>, pp. 660-662, 2016.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7374026", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7374026", "pdfSize": "2238KB"}, "title": "GNSS reliability and positioning accuracy enhancement based on fast satellite selection algorithm and RAIM in multiconstellation", "displayText": "Fanchen Meng, Shan Wang, Bocheng Zhu, \"GNSS reliability and positioning accuracy enhancement based on fast satellite selection algorithm and RAIM in multiconstellation\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine IEEE</em>, vol. 30, pp. 14-27, 2015, ISSN 0885-8985.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:42", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Fast satellite selection method for multi-constellation Global Navigation Satellite System under obstacle environments", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.029386S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Fast satellite selection method for multi-constellation Global Navigation Satellite System under obstacle environments", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985858", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
