The directional filters consist of individual balanced sections composed of hybrids and single resonators. Each of the sections corresponds to a pole of an all-pass function composed of the sum of <i>S</i><sub>11</sub> and <i>S</i><sub>12</sub> of the desired filter transfer function. A simple synthesis method is presented. The filter combiner has the advantage of ease of tunability because each pole is associated with a single resonator. Furthermore, no cross-couplings are required to realise finite frequency transmission zeros. Experimental results for a prototype device are presented."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:42", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Transversal directional filters for channel combining", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.021098S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Transversal directional filters for channel combining", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985823", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
