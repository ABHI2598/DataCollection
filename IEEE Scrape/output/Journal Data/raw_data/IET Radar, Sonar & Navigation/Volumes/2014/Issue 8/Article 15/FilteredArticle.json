The online SB estimation is implemented in two steps. In the first step, the state-free SB measurement and the UI-free SB dynamic model are derived in the case that UI-free condition holds. In the second step, the linear minimum mean squared filter is obtained via orthogonal principle, and the sufficient condition of filtering stability is presented. A simulation about target tracking is given to verify the proposed method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7260374", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7260374", "pdfSize": "524KB"}, "title": "Joint estimation of state and bias based on generalized systematic model", "displayText": "Zhou Jie, Liang Yan, Zhou Lin, Pan Quan, \"Joint estimation of state and bias based on generalized systematic model\", <em>Control Conference (CCC) 2015 34th Chinese</em>, pp. 4750-4755, 2015, ISSN 1934-1768.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-16T09:54:53", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Linear minimum mean squared estimation of measurement bias driven by structured unknown inputs", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.024619S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Linear minimum mean squared estimation of measurement bias driven by structured unknown inputs", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6911062/6911077", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
