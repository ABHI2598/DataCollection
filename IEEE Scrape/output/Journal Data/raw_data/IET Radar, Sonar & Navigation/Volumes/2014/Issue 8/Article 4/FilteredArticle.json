The mission considered is an L-band geosynchronous circular SAR (GEOCSAR) with full aperture measurement. Since the integration time of GEOCSAR can be as long as 24 h, the orbit altitude is about 36 000 km and the coverage may reach 1/3 of the Earth's surface. The spatial and temporal variation of the ionosphere may impose significant effects on 3D imaging performance of GEOCSAR. The effects of ionospheric spatial variation including vertical and horizontal structure, the ionospheric turbulence and the ionospheric temporal variation are discussed. The analysis shows that the temporal variation of the ionospheric electron content during the synthetic aperture and the ionospheric turbulence may severely affect the GEOCSAR focusing performance on the <i>XY</i> plane. The vertical and horizontal structure of the ionosphere will cause image shift, and the dispersion effect is negligible."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-16T09:54:51", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Ionospheric effects on three-dimensional imaging of L-band geosynchronous circular synthetic aperture radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.017991S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Ionospheric effects on three-dimensional imaging of L-band geosynchronous circular synthetic aperture radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6911062/6911066", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
