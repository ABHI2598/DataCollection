Within each iterative step, the image spectra samples are classified as containing contributions from fundamental, first-order and higher harmonic waves or noise. Based on the classification result, a new scheme is proposed to increase the robustness of current estimation. This involves automatically adjusting the first threshold that is used for obtaining an initial guess of the current velocity in the iterative LS method. The proposed wave algorithm directly uses the classified fundamental and first-order harmonic wave components for wave spectra and parameter retrieval. Unlike previous wave analysis techniques in which a bandpass filter is required to eliminate the non-wave contributions after the current velocity is obtained, the proposed algorithm simplifies the wave retrieval without such a bandpass filter. Algorithm verification is first conducted by using simulated radar images. Subsequently, the method is applied to field radar data and the results are compared with wave-buoy measurements. Wave parameters from both types of data show that the modified wave algorithm produces results that are close to those achieved using traditional algorithms."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7003223", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7003223", "pdfSize": "798KB"}, "title": "A review of the continuing evolution of coastal ocean radar remote sensing in the Eastern Canadian context", "displayText": "Eric W.
