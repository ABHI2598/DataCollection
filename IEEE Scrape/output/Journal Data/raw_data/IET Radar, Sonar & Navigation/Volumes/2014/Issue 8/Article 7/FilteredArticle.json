However, for a ground-based FSR imaging system, which usually includes an envelope detection module, it is pretty hard to obtain the complex RHS. Thus a novel method for RHS reconstruction is proposed by considering the relationship between the in-phase part and the orthogonal part. The operation of envelope detection is never combined with segmented Hilbert transform before in RHS reconstruction and detailed skills in applying the method are discussed with simulations. Then, the proposed method is verified through real experimental data processing, of which a metal board and a microbus are regarded as the targets. Furthermore, target profiles via SISAR imaging processing are achieved very well when using the reconstructed RHS."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7131113", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131113", "pdfSize": "1474KB"}, "title": "Target Shadow Profile Reconstruction in ground-based forward scatter radar", "displayText": "Stanislav Hristov, Liam Daniel, Edward Hoare, Mikhail Cherniakov, Marina Gashinova, \"Target Shadow Profile Reconstruction in ground-based forward scatter radar\", <em>Radar Conference (RadarCon) 2015 IEEE</em>, pp. 0846-0851, 2015.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7346241", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7346241", "pdfSize": "1473KB"}, "title": "Analysis of canonical targets in near field for Forward Scatter Radar applications", "displayText": "Marta T.
