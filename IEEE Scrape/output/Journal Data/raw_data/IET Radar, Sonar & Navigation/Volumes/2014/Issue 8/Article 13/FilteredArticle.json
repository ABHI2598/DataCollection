Closed form expressions of the physical optics technique are applied to calculate monostatic radar cross section of an electrically large wind turbine model over a dielectric, lossy half space. The model is constructed with perfectly conducting canonical structures. First-order effects of the half space to the electromagnetic scattering mechanism are approximated with four-path model. Doppler spectrogram of the turbine model over lossy ground is obtained using short-time Fourier transform. The closed form expressions provide very-fast RCS calculations for different broadside directions and blade rotation speeds. Performance of this proposed method shows that it is suitable for real-time simulations that analyse the effects of the wind farms to the radar and navigation systems performance."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-16T09:54:53", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Analytical method for monostatic radar cross section calculation of a perfectly conducting wind turbine model located over dielectric lossy half space", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.017197S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analytical method for monostatic radar cross section calculation of a perfectly conducting wind turbine model located over dielectric lossy half space", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6911062/6911075", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
