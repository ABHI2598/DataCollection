A method based on high-precision parameter estimation of geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) model is given. Considering the incoherence problem in each subband data, a coherent processing method is adopted in the paper. Based on an all-pole model, it makes use of the phase difference of pole and scattering coefficient between each sub-band to effectively estimate the incoherent components. After coherent processing, the high and low frequency subband data can be expressed as a uniform all-pole model. The gapped-data amplitude and phase estimation algorithm is adopted to fill up the gapped band. Finally, fusion data is gained by high precision parameter estimation of GTD-all-pole model with full-band data, such as scattering center number, scattering center type and amplitude. The experimental results of simulated data with fixed-points indicate that the resolution of onedimensional (1D) range profile and 2D inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) image based on this method is better than that of each sub-band. In this way, the validity of the proposed method is proved."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7408041", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7408041", "pdfSize": "254KB"}, "title": "Multiband radar signals coherent compensation with sparse representation", "displayText": "Yongqiang Zou, Xunzhang Gao, Xiang Li, Yongxiang Liu, \"Multiband radar signals coherent compensation with sparse representation\", <em>Image and Signal Processing (CISP) 2015 8th International Congress on</em>, pp. 1085-1089, 2015.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7428631", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7428631", "pdfSize": "213KB"}, "title": "Wideband radar imaging based on GTD model and compressed sensing", "displayText": "Shouqing Jia, Dongsheng La, \"Wideband radar imaging based on GTD model and compressed sensing\", <em>Advanced Information Technology Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC) 2015 IEEE</em>, pp. 636-639, 2015.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7326138", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326138", "pdfSize": "361KB"}, "title": "A modified coherent compensation method for subband fusion", "displayText": "Zou Yongqiang, Gao Xunzhang, Li Xiang, Liu Yongxiang, \"A modified coherent compensation method for subband fusion\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2015 IEEE International</em>, pp. 1793-1796, 2015.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7762476", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762476", "pdfSize": "714KB"}, "title": "Tomographic SAR imaging based on GTD model and compressed sensing", "displayText": "Shouqing Jia, Dongsheng La, \"Tomographic SAR imaging based on GTD model and compressed sensing\", <em>Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT) 2016 IEEE International Conference on</em>, vol. 2, pp. 889-891, 2016.", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7408067", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7408067", "pdfSize": "243KB"}, "title": "A high precision GTD parameter estimation method", "displayText": "Yongqiang Zou, Xunzhang Gao, Xiang Li, Yongxiang Liu, \"A high precision GTD parameter estimation method\", <em>Image and Signal Processing (CISP) 2015 8th International Congress on</em>, pp. 1220-1224, 2015.", "order": "5"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2015-12-17T16:10:14", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Sparse subband fusion imaging based on parameter estimation of geometrical theory of diffraction model", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.034535S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Sparse subband fusion imaging based on parameter estimation of geometrical theory of diffraction model", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6783560/6825705", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "5"}}
