The statistical properties of theNSD are investigated and a simple criterion for fixing the decision threshold is provided. In particular, approximations for the false alarm and detection probabilities are derived and used to characterise the performance of the NSD. The application of the NSD to the detection of pulsed bi-phased signals is then considered. The validity of the theoretical findings is supported by real data analysis and Monte Carlo simulation"}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7551809", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7551809", "pdfSize": "116KB"}, "title": "Generalized integration techniques for high-sensitivity GNSS receivers affected by oscillator phase noise", "displayText": "David G&#x00F3;mez-Casco, Jos&#x00E9; A.
