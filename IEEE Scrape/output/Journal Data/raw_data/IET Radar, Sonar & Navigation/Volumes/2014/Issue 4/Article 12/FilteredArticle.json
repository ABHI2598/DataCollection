Compared with a conventional MIMO DBF radar system with M-element transmitting array and N-element receiving array, the proposed concept can reduce the number of transmitter/receivers from M+ N to 2 for a drastic cost reduction. In addition to theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, an experimental TDM MIMO DBF radar demonstrator is realised and tested for verification using real data. Numerical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed concept can achieve considerable higher angular resolution at lower cost compared to conventional DBF radar concepts using the same antenna array with one-way or two-way beamforming."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7131104", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131104", "pdfSize": "993KB"}, "title": "Performance analysis of time division and code division waveforms in co-located MIMO", "displayText": "Lorenzo Lo Monte, Braham Himed, Thomas Corigliano, Christopher J.
