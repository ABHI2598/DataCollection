To the best of our knowledge, there is no research result on the filter design dealing with such estimation problem. Here, an upper-bound filter is designed for the linear time-varying system with the GUD existing in the measurement equation, and optimal parameters are derived so that the minimum upper-bounds filter is obtained. The result is further extended to the non-linear case via the iterative optimisation of joint state estimation and parameter identification (the linearised measurement matrix). The simulation about tracking a target via one biased radar and one biased electronic support measure (ESM) shows the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed filter."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2015-12-17T16:10:13", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Adaptive filter of non-linear systems with generalised unknown disturbances", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018476S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Adaptive filter of non-linear systems with generalised unknown disturbances", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6783560/6825704", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
