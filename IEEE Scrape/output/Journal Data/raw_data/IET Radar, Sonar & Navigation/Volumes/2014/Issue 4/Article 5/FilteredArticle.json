However, its performance degrades for non-stationary targets in noisy condition as the algorithm has not taken into consideration the Doppler shift effect. On the other hand, the recently reported Doppler compensated APC (DC-APC) technique performs well only for non-stationary objects. Thus, there is a need to develop an algorithm that would work efficiently both for stationary and non-stationary conditions. Keeping this in view, a generalised APC (G-APC) algorithm is developed in which the effect of target Doppler is incorporated in the received signal model. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated through five different cases. The results of the simulation study demonstrate comparable and superior performance of the proposed G-APC over several pulse compression models based on NMF, APC and DC-APC in all cases."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7341042", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7341042", "pdfSize": "1214KB"}, "title": "The parameter estimation of transmit diversity MIMO radar with iteratively adaptive pulse compression and Doppler compensation", "displayText": "Haiqing Wang, Xiaohua Zhu, \"The parameter estimation of transmit diversity MIMO radar with iteratively adaptive pulse compression and Doppler compensation\", <em>Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP) 2015 International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-5, 2015.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:50", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Development and performance evaluation of generalised doppler compensated adaptive pulse compression algorithm", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.023039S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Development and performance evaluation of generalised doppler compensated adaptive pulse compression algorithm", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6783560/6825703", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
