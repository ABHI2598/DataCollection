Construction of the framework of the proposed algorithm consists of two phases. In the first phase, the compressed signals by random projections are used instead of traditional signal features to represent the original signal. In the second, the robust SC approach is investigated to the radar waveform recognition. Compared with the existing feature-based recognition method, the random projections and sparse classification-based algorithm can improve the information completeness, efficiency and the noise robust. The validity of the recognition algorithm is demonstrated with the analysis and simulations."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7382018", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7382018", "pdfSize": "245KB"}, "title": "A robust radar emitter signals recognition algorithm based on Cauchy random projection", "displayText": "Zhiwen Zhou, Gaoming Huang, Jun Gao, \"A robust radar emitter signals recognition algorithm based on Cauchy random projection\", <em>Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD) 2015 12th International Conference on</em>, pp. 644-648, 2015.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7408069", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7408069", "pdfSize": "235KB"}, "title": "An emitter fusion recognition algorithm based on multi-collaborative representations", "displayText": "Zhiwen Zhou, Gaoming Huang, Jun Gao, \"An emitter fusion recognition algorithm based on multi-collaborative representations\", <em>Image and Signal Processing (CISP) 2015 8th International Congress on</em>, pp. 1231-1235, 2015.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2015-12-17T16:10:12", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Robust radar waveform recognition algorithm based on random projections and sparse classification", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.027558S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Robust radar waveform recognition algorithm based on random projections and sparse classification", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6783560/6825702", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
