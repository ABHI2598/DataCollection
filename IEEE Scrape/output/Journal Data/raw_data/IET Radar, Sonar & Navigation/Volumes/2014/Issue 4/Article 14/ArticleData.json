In this case, the ocean surface, a mixture of both swell and wind wave components, is first represented with a Fourier series. In one of the two approaches used, the total Fourier coefficient is expanded as a linear sum of the contribution from swell and wind waves without considering the possible interaction between the two regimes; whereas in a second, more general situation, the analysis includes coupling effects between the wind waves and swell. Then, the corresponding electric fields received from the swell-contaminated sea surface are obtained. A Fourier transform of the autocorrelation of the electric fields gives the Doppler power spectral density (PSD), and a comparison between this PSD and monostatic radar range equation yields the radar cross-sections. Simulation shows that the assumption incorporating the coupling effects leads to results that better agree with historical field observations. Overall, the model proposed here not only lays a solid foundation for the development of future swell inversion algorithms, but also reveals the existence of non-linear energy transfer between swell and wind waves from a new perspective", "isPromo": false, "publicationDate": "April 2014", "copyrightYear": "2007-2012", "isOpenAccess": false, "publisher": "IET", "articleId": "6825712", "issue": "4", "isDynamicHtml": false, "citationCount": "1", "htmlAbstractLink": "/document/6825712/", "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2013.0037", "accessionNumber": "", "issn": [{"format": "Print ISSN", "value": "1751-8784"}, {"format": "Online ISSN", "value": "1751-8792"}], "isSMPTE": false, "articleNumber": "6825712", "userInfo": {"institute": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "guest": false, "member": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "fileCabinetContent": false, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "subscribedContent": false, "showGet802Link": false}, "isBook": false, "isFreeDocument": false, "isEarlyAccess": false}, "references": [], "citations": {"contentType": "periodicals", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6783560/6825712", "publisher": "IET", "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7003223", "pdfSize": "798KB", "documentLink": "/document/7003223", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "order": "1", "displayText": "Eric W.
