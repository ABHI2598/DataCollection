In this case, the ocean surface, a mixture of both swell and wind wave components, is first represented with a Fourier series. In one of the two approaches used, the total Fourier coefficient is expanded as a linear sum of the contribution from swell and wind waves without considering the possible interaction between the two regimes; whereas in a second, more general situation, the analysis includes coupling effects between the wind waves and swell. Then, the corresponding electric fields received from the swell-contaminated sea surface are obtained. A Fourier transform of the autocorrelation of the electric fields gives the Doppler power spectral density (PSD), and a comparison between this PSD and monostatic radar range equation yields the radar cross-sections. Simulation shows that the assumption incorporating the coupling effects leads to results that better agree with historical field observations. Overall, the model proposed here not only lays a solid foundation for the development of future swell inversion algorithms, but also reveals the existence of non-linear energy transfer between swell and wind waves from a new perspective"}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7003223", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7003223", "pdfSize": "798KB"}, "title": "A review of the continuing evolution of coastal ocean radar remote sensing in the Eastern Canadian context", "displayText": "Eric W.
