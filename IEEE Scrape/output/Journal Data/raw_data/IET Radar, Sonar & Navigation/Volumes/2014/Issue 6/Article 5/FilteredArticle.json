An integrated scheme of effective ATI-baseline estimation is proposed, which includes two key procedures: fine co-registration and median filtering. The proposed algorithm is tested with real SAR data. The results show that the incorporation of the fine co-registration and the median filtering procedures in the estimation scheme represents an accurate solution to the effective baseline estimation problem."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T13:50:56", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Accurate baseline estimation for synthetic aperture radar-ground moving target indication systems based on co-registration and median filtering", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019004S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Accurate baseline estimation for synthetic aperture radar-ground moving target indication systems based on co-registration and median filtering", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6846219/6846224", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
