Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) and Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) systems broadcast strong pulsed ranging signals within the Global Positioning System L5 and Galileo E5a frequency bands where the aviation positioning aids services are allocated. This study provides an experimental assessment of the DME/TACAN interference effect on the GNSS receivers performance in scenarios where the presence of several transmitters in view generates radio-frequency interference hard to mitigate by means of the classical solutions. In detail, analysis in terms of the receiver performance will be presented by showing the effect of the non-ideal pulse blanking on the GNSS signal quality. The optimal set-up of the mitigation process, investigated by means of a software simulation, is provided."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7444136", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7444136", "pdfSize": "745KB"}, "title": "Protecting GNSS Receivers From Jamming and Interference", "displayText": "Grace Xingxin Gao, Matteo Sgammini, Mingquan Lu, Nobuaki Kubo, \"Protecting GNSS Receivers From Jamming and Interference\", <em>Proceedings of the IEEE</em>, vol. 104, pp. 1327-1338, 2016, ISSN 0018-9219.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6851500", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6851500", "pdfSize": "622KB"}, "title": "Effect of pulse blanking on navigation data demodulation performance in GNSS system", "displayText": "Luciano Musumeci, Fabio Dovis, \"Effect of pulse blanking on navigation data demodulation performance in GNSS system\", <em>Position Location and Navigation Symposium - PLANS 2014 2014 IEEE/ION</em>, pp. 1248-1257, 2014, ISSN 2153-3598.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T14:09:15", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Performance assessment of pulse blanking mitigation in presence of multiple Distance Measuring Equipment/Tactical Air Navigation interference on Global Navigation Satellite Systems signals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.030953S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Performance assessment of pulse blanking mitigation in presence of multiple Distance Measuring Equipment/Tactical Air Navigation interference on Global Navigation Satellite Systems signals", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6846219/6846229", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
