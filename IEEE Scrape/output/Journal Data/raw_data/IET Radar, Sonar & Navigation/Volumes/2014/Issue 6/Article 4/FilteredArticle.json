In this algorithm, the joint estimation problem is firstly linked to the compressed sensing trilinear model, then the estimated compressed matrix can be derived through trilinear alternating least square method and the angle and Doppler frequency are jointly estimated with sparsity from the compressed matrices. The proposed CS-PARAFAC algorithm, which can obtain automatically paired angle and Doppler frequency estimation, has very close estimation performance to the conventional parallel factor analysis algorithm. When compared to the conventional subspace-based algorithm, such as estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques, it can achieve much better joint angle and Doppler frequency estimation performance. As the compression, the proposed algorithm has much lower computational complexity and smaller memory capacity meanwhile. Numerical simulations verify the efficiency and illustrate performance improvement of the proposed algorithm."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7753676", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753676", "pdfSize": "963KB"}, "title": "Fast MUSIC algorithm for joint DOD-DOA estimation based on Gibbs Sampling in MIMO array", "displayText": "Wentao Shi, Chengbing He, Jianguo Huang, Qunfei Zhang, \"Fast MUSIC algorithm for joint DOD-DOA estimation based on Gibbs Sampling in MIMO array\", <em>Signal Processing Communications and Computing (ICSPCC) 2016 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2016.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T13:55:18", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Compressed sensing parallel factor analysis-based joint angle and Doppler frequency estimation for monostatic multiple-input&#x2013;multiple-output radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.027409S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Compressed sensing parallel factor analysis-based joint angle and Doppler frequency estimation for monostatic multiple-input&#x2013;multiple-output radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6846219/6846223", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
