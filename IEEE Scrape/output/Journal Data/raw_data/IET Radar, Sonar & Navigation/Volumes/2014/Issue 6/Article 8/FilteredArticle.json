The proposed method generally outperforms traditional adaptive beamformers in surprise or rapidly changing interference scenarios due to the use of a <i>D</i><sup>3</sup> interference cancellation technique, which utilises a single snapshot for adaptive beamforming. The proposed <i>D</i><sup>3</sup> approach suffers from performance degradation in the presence of uncertainty in the knowledge of target direction. To overcome this problem, a robust <i>D</i><sup>3</sup> approach using worst-case performance optimisation is developed to achieve robustness against look direction error."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T13:54:32", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Adaptive multiple-input multiple-output radar beamforming based on direct data domain approach", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.015694S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Adaptive multiple-input multiple-output radar beamforming based on direct data domain approach", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6846219/6846227", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
