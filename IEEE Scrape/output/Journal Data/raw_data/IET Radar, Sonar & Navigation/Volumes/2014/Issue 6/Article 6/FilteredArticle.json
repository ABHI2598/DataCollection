The authors here extend the idea to incorporate further robustness to background type whilst retaining sensitivity to local changes in texture caused by the presence of man-made objects. The resulting textural-lacunarity features are constructed by estimating the joint distribution of local neighbourhoods with empirical distributions over an adaptive texton dictionary. Experiments on a synthetic aperture sonar imagery dataset suggest that the features offer significant improvements in the receiver operating curve."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7140790", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140790", "pdfSize": "2722KB"}, "title": "Fast Unsupervised Seafloor Characterization in Sonar Imagery Using Lacunarity", "displayText": "David P.
