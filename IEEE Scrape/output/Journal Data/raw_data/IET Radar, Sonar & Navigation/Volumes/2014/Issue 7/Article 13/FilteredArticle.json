This paper proposes an adaptive robust ultra-tightly coupled GNSS/INS system based on a novel vector tracking strategy for combining both global positioning system (GPS) L1 and BeiDou B1 signals' tracking together. The inherent mechanism of the vector tracking approach has been analysed to describe the relationship between the replica signals and user's dynamic state. Then, an adaptive robust filter is used to gain the accurate estimates of vehicle states when the vehicle is under a weak-signal or large manoeuvring environment. Finally, the experimental platform is set up using a GPS/BeiDou signal simulator and an inertial measurement unit simulator and the test results show that the proposed ultra-tightly coupled system can keep the tracking loops from the high dynamic perturbations, which saves the cost time of signal reacquisition. Moreover, the presented adaptive robust ultra-tightly coupled system can obtain a higher accuracy than Kalman filtering in a simultaneous weak-signal and large manoeuvring environment."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6983549", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983549", "pdfSize": "1874KB"}, "title": "PMI-Based Nonlinear <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$H_\\infty $ </tex-math></inline-formula> Estimation of Unknown Sensor Error for INS/GPS Integrated System", "displayText": "Maiying Zhong, Dingfei Guo, Jia Guo, \"PMI-Based Nonlinear <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=LaTeX>$H_infty $ </tex-math></inline-formula> Estimation of Unknown Sensor Error for INS/GPS Integrated System\", <em>Sensors Journal IEEE</em>, vol. 15, pp. 2785-2794, 2015, ISSN 1530-437X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7566110", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7566110", "pdfSize": "300KB"}, "title": "An Extended Kalman Filter for Low-Cost Positioning System in Agricultural Vehicles", "displayText": "Nenavath Ravi Kumar, E.
