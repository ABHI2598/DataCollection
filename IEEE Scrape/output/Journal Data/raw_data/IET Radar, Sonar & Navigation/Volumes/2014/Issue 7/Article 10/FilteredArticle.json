The authors present adaptive delay line canceller techniques to suppress the zero-Doppler direct path and its clutter almost down to the receiver noise level. The proposed approaches offer the following two advantages compared with the other clutter cancellation techniques: they are fail-safe with respect to the errors in the reference signal extraction simply because they do not require any knowledge of the reference signal and they even work in severely non-stationary clutter conditions. The effectiveness of the approaches is demonstrated by means of measurements recorded with an experimental passive bistatic radar system."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7511860", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7511860", "pdfSize": "1981KB"}, "title": "Sliding extensive cancellation algorithm for disturbance removal in passive radar", "displayText": "Fabiola Colone, Claudio Palmarini, Tatiana Martelli, Enrico Tilli, \"Sliding extensive cancellation algorithm for disturbance removal in passive radar\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 52, pp. 1309-1326, 2016, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T14:04:00", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Clutter cancellation in passive radar using GSM broadcast channels", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.022997S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Clutter cancellation in passive radar using GSM broadcast channels", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6867010/6867020", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
