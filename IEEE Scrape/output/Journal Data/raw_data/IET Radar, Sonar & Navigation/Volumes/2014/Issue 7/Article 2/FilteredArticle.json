The B-FIM is derived from a signal model that incorporates the propagation path loss, the target reflectivity, the transmitted power and target prior information. The authors model the problem as a cooperative game and exploit the solution concept of Shapley value to distribute a given power budget among all transmitting radars for localisation and integrate the algorithm with a sequential Bayesian estimator to localise target. In numerical simulations, it is shown that uniform power allocation is not in general optimal. They illustrate the impact of the radar antenna geometry and target location prior density on the allocation results and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed optimal power allocation scheme via Monte Carlo simulations."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7485222", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7485222", "pdfSize": "386KB"}, "title": "LPI based resource management for target tracking in distributed radar network", "displayText": "Chenguang Shi, Jianjiang Zhou, Fei Wang, \"LPI based resource management for target tracking in distributed radar network\", <em>Radar Conference (RadarConf) 2016 IEEE</em>, pp. 1-5, 2016, ISSN 2375-5318.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T14:10:26", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Power allocation for range-only localisation in distributed multiple-input multiple-output radar networks - a cooperative game approach", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.024086S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Power allocation for range-only localisation in distributed multiple-input multiple-output radar networks - a cooperative game approach", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6867010/6867012", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
