Multistatic radar networks can be used to both increase detection capability and localisation accuracy. The standard Crame&#x0301;r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) cannot be used for a realistic assessment of the target localisation accuracy in a surveillance area since it provides optimistic predictions. In this study, the authors derive the CRLB with missing observations, namely for <i>P</i><sub>d</sub> &lt;; 1, for the multisensory case. The results are illustrated for the case study of a multistatic passive radar exploiting FM radio transmissions where each bistatic pair within the network is assigned with a detection probability for each target position in the surveillance area. The obtained CRLB with <i>P</i><sub>d</sub> &lt;; 1 is then employed to compare the localisation performance achievable by a multistatic passive radar when using different sets of measurements: (A) only range measurements, (B) range and Doppler frequency measurements and (C) Doppler frequency measurements only. The reported results show that the proposed CRLB with <i>P</i><sub>d</sub> &lt;; 1 yields a more reliable prediction of the achievable performance thus allowing a fair comparison of the above different strategies for target localisation."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7131118", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131118", "pdfSize": "374KB"}, "title": "Receiver placement in multistatic passive radars", "displayText": "Jianxin Yi, Xianrong Wan, Henry Leung, \"Receiver placement in multistatic passive radars\", <em>Radar Conference (RadarCon) 2015 IEEE</em>, pp. 0876-0879, 2015.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7493611", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7493611", "pdfSize": "409KB"}, "title": "Moving Target Localization in Multistatic Sonar by Differential Delays and Doppler Shifts", "displayText": "Liu Yang, Le Yang, K.
