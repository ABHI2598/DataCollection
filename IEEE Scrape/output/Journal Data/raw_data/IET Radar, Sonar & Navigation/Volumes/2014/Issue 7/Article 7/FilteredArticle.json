In this study, the effects of K distributed sea clutter and multipath on radar detection performance for low altitude sea surface targets are analysed. First, the probability density function of the multipath power propagation factor is derived by taking specular and diffuse reflections into account. Based on this, mathematical expressions of radar detection and false alarm probabilities in K distributed sea clutter and multipath are further derived. The radar detection performances in various K distributed sea clutter and multipath circumstances by simulation are presented, and the impacts of K distributed clutter and multipath on radar detection performance are analysed."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7754415", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754415", "pdfSize": "343KB"}, "title": "Analysis of radar detection performance for low altitude small target", "displayText": "Fu Qi-xiang Yang Yong, Feng De-jun, Xiao Shun-ping, \"Analysis of radar detection performance for low altitude small target\", <em>Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP) 2016 International Conference on</em>, pp. 0063-0068, 2016.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T13:52:15", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Effects of K distributed sea clutter and multipath on radar detection of low altitude sea surface targets", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.023662S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Effects of K distributed sea clutter and multipath on radar detection of low altitude sea surface targets", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6867010/6867017", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
