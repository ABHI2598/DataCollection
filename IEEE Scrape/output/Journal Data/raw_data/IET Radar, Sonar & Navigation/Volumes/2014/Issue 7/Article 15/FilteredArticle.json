First, a spatial-temporal scheme is used to expand the degrees of freedom in the array. Thus, the number of target AODs and AOAs that can be estimated is higher than the number of the product of the transmit and receive elements. The steering vectors of AODs and AOAs are then obtained from spatial-temporal eigenvectors, which contain the spatial and temporal information of received signals. This enables highly accurate AOD and AOA estimates even in an overloaded system. The results of several simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T14:11:50", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Joint angles of departure and angles of arrival estimation via a spatial-temporal scheme in overloaded bistatic multiple-input multiple-output radars", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.016608S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Joint angles of departure and angles of arrival estimation via a spatial-temporal scheme in overloaded bistatic multiple-input multiple-output radars", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6867010/6867025", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
