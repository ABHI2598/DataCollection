BOC modulated signals are, however, characterised by ambiguous multi-peaked correlation functions and several techniques have been proposed in the literature to solve the problem of locking into secondary peaks. In this study, a novel unambiguous BOC tracking technique, the double phase estimator (DPE), is designed to account for the effect of signal bandlimiting. The DPE is an effective alternative to the double estimator (DE) tracking technique where the subcarrier lock loop is replaced by a subcarrier phase lock loop. In the presence of signal bandlimiting, the DPE is able to generate local signal replicas matched in a better manner to the input components, outperforming the DE. The performance of the DPE is thoroughly characterised and the processing of real wideband BOC signals is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed. In addition to this, the DPE requires a lower computational load than the DE and thus should be adopted for the processing of wideband BOC signals."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7045138", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7045138", "pdfSize": "833KB"}, "title": "Double phase estimator: New results", "displayText": "Daniele Borio, \"Double phase estimator: New results\", <em>Satellite Navigation Technologies and European Workshop on GNSS Signals and Signal Processing (NAVITEC) 2014 7th ESA Workshop on</em>, pp. 1-6, 2014, ISSN 2325-5455.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7467482", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7467482", "pdfSize": "762KB"}, "title": "Decimation Double-Phase Estimator: An Efficient and Unambiguous High-Order Binary Offset Carrier Tracking Algorithm", "displayText": "Tian Feng, \"Decimation Double-Phase Estimator: An Efficient and Unambiguous High-Order Binary Offset Carrier Tracking Algorithm\", <em>Signal Processing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 23, pp. 905-909, 2016, ISSN 1070-9908.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7470628", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7470628", "pdfSize": "512KB"}, "title": "Unambiguous Tracking of BOC Signals Using Coherent Combination of Dual Sidebands", "displayText": "Tian Feng, Zhang Kai, Cheng Liang, \"Unambiguous Tracking of BOC Signals Using Coherent Combination of Dual Sidebands\", <em>Communications Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 20, pp. 1555-1558, 2016, ISSN 1089-7798.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T14:12:29", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Double phase estimator: new unambiguous binary offset carrier tracking algorithm", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.032641S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Double phase estimator: new unambiguous binary offset carrier tracking algorithm", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6867010/6867014", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
