Consequently, this results in mixer outputs that consist of several linear frequency modulation components with a small frequency rate (FR). The authors define an FR function to transform a signal from the time domain into the FR domain and discuss the FR range of a discrete signal. Then an interesting phenomenon is found in the FR domain, that is, the mixer output is concentrated in a low FR region, while the Gaussian noise spreads over the entire FR region. Therefore, a range-spread target detector has been proposed that regards the integration of the values in a vicinity of zero FR as the test statistic. This detector uses a single mixer output and thus has the ability to detect the target with a high velocity. Finally, the proposed detector is evaluated by recorded radar data. Experimental results show that the proposed detector outperforms the detectors using the high-resolution range profile."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T14:08:16", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Range-spread target detector using the frequency rate function", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018306S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Range-spread target detector using the frequency rate function", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6867010/6867016", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
