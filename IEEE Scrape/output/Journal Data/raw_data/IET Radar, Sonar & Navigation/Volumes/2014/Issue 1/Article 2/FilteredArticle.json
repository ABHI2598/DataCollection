In the past, target focusing and reverberation nulling are separately investigated as two complementary aspects of time-reversal processing. In essence, nulling is regarded as one kind of focusing with minimising the energy incident on a location. When time-reversal operation is regarded as inversed beamforming, it is available to simultaneously realise time-reversal focusing and nulling under an optimum beamforming framework. The feasibility of the combination processing is evaluated in detection of a small target in the presence of strong reverberation. The acoustic energy focused on a target of interest is maintained constant while reverberation is regarded as an interference to be suppressed by the nulling technique. The experimental results have verified the effectiveness of optimum time-reversal processing for active target detection in a shallow water environment."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6830438", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6830438", "pdfSize": "384KB"}, "title": "Underwater target bearing detection by time and frequency domain beamforming", "displayText": "Yilmaz Karakaya, Tansal Gucluoglu, \"Underwater target bearing detection by time and frequency domain beamforming\", <em>Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU) 2014 22nd</em>, pp. 1150-1153, 2014.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:42:17", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Combination of time-reversal focusing and nulling for detection of small targets in strong reverberation environments", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.022662S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Combination of time-reversal focusing and nulling for detection of small targets in strong reverberation environments", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6702403/6702405", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
