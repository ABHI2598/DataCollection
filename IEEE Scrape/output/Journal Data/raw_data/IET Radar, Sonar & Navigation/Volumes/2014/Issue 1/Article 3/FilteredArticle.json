Both the considered techniques, namely AB space-time adaptive processing (AB-STAP) and generalised monopulse estimator, are based on a dual cancelled channel approach that simplifies their implementation. An extensive performance comparison is presented for the ground moving targets. Both the theoretical and simulated analyses of DOA estimation are performed, which include the comparison to the Crame&#x0301;r-Rao bound. The considered processing schemes are shown to yield comparable accuracies in target DOA estimation with respect to a maximum likelihood estimator. Moreover, they ensure lower computational cost, since no numerical maximisation of any functional is required. AB-STAP shows the additional nice property of estimation robustness when a limited set of homogeneous data is available to achieve the adaptivity. The comparison is finally performed applying the different estimators to a set of real multichannel data."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7312480", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7312480", "pdfSize": "4409KB"}, "title": "Joint Monostatic and Bistatic STAP for Improved SAR-GMTI Capabilities", "displayText": "Diego Cristallini, Ingo Walterscheid, \"Joint Monostatic and Bistatic STAP for Improved SAR-GMTI Capabilities\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 54, pp. 1834-1848, 2016, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7338856", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7338856", "pdfSize": "195KB"}, "title": "Joint space and time domain processing for DOA estimation", "displayText": "Kai Wang, Ling Wang, Chuang Han, \"Joint space and time domain processing for DOA estimation\", <em>Signal Processing Communications and Computing (ICSPCC) 2015 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2015.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T13:56:16", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Direction of arrival estimation performance comparison of dual cancelled channels space-time adaptive processing techniques", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.030933S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Direction of arrival estimation performance comparison of dual cancelled channels space-time adaptive processing techniques", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6702403/6702406", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
