However, the fact is that these two noises may be correlated with each other in actual applications. The filtering of the non-linear systems with cross-correlated process and observation noises at the same epoch is studied. First, a decorrelated scheme is introduced and a pseudo non-linear process equation is reconstructed in which the corresponding pseudo process noise is no longer cross-correlated with the observation noise; so a celebrated non-linear filter, that is, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) can be used to filter the non-linear problem. Second, the (conditionally) linear substructure in the above non-linear system is exploited and a refined filter called marginal UKF is employed so as to reduce computational load without deteriorating the accuracy. The performance of the standard UKF for the original system equations, the standard and marginal unscented UKFs for the reconstructed system equation are compared in the simulation. From the results of the simulation, the theoretical statements are validated, and some interesting but not surprising phenomena are also founded, that is, the performance of the conventional filter actually does not degenerate, whereas that of the proposed filters become better when cross-correlation exists and increases. This phenomenon can be due to the fact that the proposed filters exploited the extra information buried in the cross-correlation, whereas the conventional filter fails to do so."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7237736", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237736", "pdfSize": "682KB"}, "title": "An improved Gaussian filter with Asynchronously correlated noises", "displayText": "Han Yu, Xiujie Zhang, Shenmin Song, Shuo Wang, \"An improved Gaussian filter with Asynchronously correlated noises\", <em>Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA) 2015 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1670-1675, 2015.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T14:12:33", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Marginal unscented kalman filter for cross-correlated process and observation noise at the same epoch", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.026291S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Marginal unscented kalman filter for cross-correlated process and observation noise at the same epoch", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6702403/6702410", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
