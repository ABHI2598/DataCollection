Multistatic radar can employ multiple receivers, which are usually located far away enough not to simultaneously receive the response from the same target. It is assumed that the authors receive returns from M distinct radar targets. In this study, they assume that each receiver receives only one target response, which is reasonable assumption for the multistatic receivers which are separated enough not to receive the same target response together. Using the projections of all the M target responses onto the column space associated with the specific kth radar target, they try to recognise which radar target response is from the kth radar. The derived expressions are validated by comparing the results obtained from the derived expressions with the results from the Monte Carlo simulation."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-08-26T14:55:47", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Performance analysis of natural frequency-based multiple radar target recognition for multiple-input- multiple-output radar application", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018124S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Performance analysis of natural frequency-based multiple radar target recognition for multiple-input- multiple-output radar application", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6824661/6824667", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
