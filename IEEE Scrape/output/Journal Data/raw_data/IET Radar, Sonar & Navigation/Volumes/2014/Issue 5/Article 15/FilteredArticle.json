In this framework, they devise and assess two selective receivers exploiting the Rao test and the generalised likelihood ratio test design criteria. The performance assessment, conducted by Monte Carlo simulation, has shown that the proposed receivers can significantly outperform their unstructured counterparts and guarantee enhanced rejection performance of unwanted signals with respect to their natural competitors."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7426844", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7426844", "pdfSize": "4259KB"}, "title": "Adaptive Detection of Point-Like Targets in Spectrally Symmetric Interference", "displayText": "Antonio De Maio, Danilo Orlando, Chengpeng Hao, Goffredo Foglia, \"Adaptive Detection of Point-Like Targets in Spectrally Symmetric Interference\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 64, pp. 3207-3220, 2016, ISSN 1053-587X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6933897", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6933897", "pdfSize": "1121KB"}, "title": "A Tunable W-ABORT-Like Detector with Improved Detection vs Rejection Capabilities Trade-Off", "displayText": "Angelo Coluccia, Giuseppe Ricci, \"A Tunable W-ABORT-Like Detector with Improved Detection vs Rejection Capabilities Trade-Off\", <em>Signal Processing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 22, pp. 713-717, 2015, ISSN 1070-9908.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7115873", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7115873", "pdfSize": "2211KB"}, "title": "Design and Analysis of Invariant Receivers for Gaussian Targets", "displayText": "Antonio De Maio, Danilo Orlando, Alfonso Farina, Goffredo Foglia, \"Design and Analysis of Invariant Receivers for Gaussian Targets\", <em>Selected Topics in Signal Processing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 9, pp. 1560-1569, 2015, ISSN 1932-4553.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7376203", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7376203", "pdfSize": "1012KB"}, "title": "Persymmetric adaptive detection and range estimation of a small target", "displayText": "Chengpeng Hao, Saeed Gazor, Goffredo Foglia, Bin Liu, Chaohuan Hou, \"Persymmetric adaptive detection and range estimation of a small target\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 51, pp. 2590-2604, 2015, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "4"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-08-26T14:55:48", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Persymmetric detectors with enhanced rejection capabilities", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.044919S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Persymmetric detectors with enhanced rejection capabilities", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6824661/6824676", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "4"}}
