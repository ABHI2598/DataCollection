This scenario may occur because of various factors such as rugged topography, atmospheric turbulence and intended manoeuvres. To address this challenge, this study develops a novel PFA with aperture accommodation for spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. The proposed algorithm provides a new adaption of the fast Gaussian grid (FGG) non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) scheme to two-dimensional (2D) SAR imaging of 3D scene, whose main idea is to convolve the nonuniform samples onto a uniform grid with a Gaussian kernel and then exploit the efficient 2D FFT for image reconstruction. In virtue of the 2D FGG NUFFT, a favourable tradeoff between reconstruction precision and computational efficiency is gained. Simulations illustrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the conventional non-uniform Sinc interpolation method. Also, the public real Gotcha dataset validates the effectiveness of the authors method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6853358", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6853358", "pdfSize": "1321KB"}, "title": "An Improved PFA With Aperture Accommodation for Widefield Spotlight SAR Imaging", "displayText": "Bo Fan, Yuliang Qin, Peng You, Hongqiang Wang, \"An Improved PFA With Aperture Accommodation for Widefield Spotlight SAR Imaging\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 12, pp. 3-7, 2015, ISSN 1545-598X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7468474", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7468474", "pdfSize": "3832KB"}, "title": "Spaceborne/Stationary Bistatic SAR Imaging With TerraSAR-X as an Illuminator in Staring-Spotlight Mode", "displayText": "Heng Zhang, Yunkai Deng, Robert Wang, Ning Li, Shuo Zhao, Feng Hong, Lixin Wu, Otmar Loffeld, \"Spaceborne/Stationary Bistatic SAR Imaging With TerraSAR-X as an Illuminator in Staring-Spotlight Mode\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 54, pp. 5203-5216, 2016, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-08-26T14:55:48", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Polar format algorithm based on fast Gaussian grid non-uniform fast fourier transform for spotlight synthetic aperture radar imaging", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.027025S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Polar format algorithm based on fast Gaussian grid non-uniform fast fourier transform for spotlight synthetic aperture radar imaging", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6824661/6824672", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
