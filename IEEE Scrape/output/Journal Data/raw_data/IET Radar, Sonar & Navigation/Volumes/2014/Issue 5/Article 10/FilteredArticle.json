To obtain the ideal SNR gain in the above scenarios, a novel long-time coherent integration method has been proposed, namely wideband-scaled Radon-Fourier transform (WSRFT). The proposed WSRFT can compensate the scale effect not only on the single pulse but also among the multiple pulses in a long coherent integration time. Furthermore, the performance comparison between the proposed WSRFT and the existing Radon-Fourier transform method is given. Finally, some numerical experimental results are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed WSRFT method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7373672", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7373672", "pdfSize": "3726KB"}, "title": "Fast Non-Searching Method for Maneuvering Target Detection and Motion Parameters Estimation", "displayText": "Xiaolong Li, Guolong Cui, Lingjiang Kong, Wei Yi, \"Fast Non-Searching Method for Maneuvering Target Detection and Motion Parameters Estimation\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 64, pp. 2232-2244, 2016, ISSN 1053-587X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7554128", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7554128", "pdfSize": "501KB"}, "title": "Weak target detection based on complex Duffing oscillator for HFSWR", "displayText": "Ling Zhang, Li-Ping Zeng, Ming Li, Hong-Du Wang, \"Weak target detection based on complex Duffing oscillator for HFSWR\", <em>Control Conference (CCC) 2016 35th Chinese</em>, pp. 4982-4987, 2016, ISSN 1934-1768.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7376262", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7376262", "pdfSize": "5543KB"}, "title": "Joint estimation of motion parameters using Newton's method", "displayText": "Zhenmiao Deng, Maozhong Fu, Sheng Jin, Yixiong Zhang, Zhiling Wang, \"Joint estimation of motion parameters using Newton's method\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 51, pp. 3386-3398, 2015, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7112638", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7112638", "pdfSize": "3056KB"}, "title": "Coherent Integration Algorithm for a Maneuvering Target With High-Order Range Migration", "displayText": "Lingjiang Kong, Xiaolong Li, Guolong Cui, Wei Yi, Yichuan Yang, \"Coherent Integration Algorithm for a Maneuvering Target With High-Order Range Migration\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 63, pp. 4474-4486, 2015, ISSN 1053-587X.", "order": "4"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-08-26T14:55:47", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Wideband-scaled Radon-Fourier transform for high-speed radar target detection", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.042909S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Wideband-scaled Radon-Fourier transform for high-speed radar target detection", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6824661/6824671", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "4"}}
