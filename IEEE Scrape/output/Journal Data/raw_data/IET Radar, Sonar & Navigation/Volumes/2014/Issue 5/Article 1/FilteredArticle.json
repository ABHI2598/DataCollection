To solve the contradiction of the array pattern beamwidth and array aperture, multiple cross-loop/monopole (CM) antennas are used as sub-arrays to form a uniform linear array, which is called the CM-uniform linear array (ULA). Adaptive beamforming via virtual interferences is used to synthesize the desired pattern and a half beamwidth of about 20&#x000B0; is achieved by a two-unit CMULA with a spacing of 0.75&#x003BB; (&#x003BB; is the radar wavelength). A novel iterative method is proposed to calibrate the array errors, including the individual antenna pattern distortions and the channel gain/phase errors, without resorting to any known signals such as a beacon or transponder signal. Simulations are executed and the results show the validity of the proposed method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7067373", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7067373", "pdfSize": "367KB"}, "title": "A Phase Error Estimation Method for Broad Beam High-Frequency Radar", "displayText": "Zezong Chen, Gengfei Zeng, Chen Zhao, Longgang Zhang, \"A Phase Error Estimation Method for Broad Beam High-Frequency Radar\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 12, pp. 1526-1530, 2015, ISSN 1545-598X.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-08-26T14:55:48", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Calibration of antenna pattern and phase errors of a cross-loop/monopole antenna array in high-frequency surface wave radars", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.022642S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Calibration of antenna pattern and phase errors of a cross-loop/monopole antenna array in high-frequency surface wave radars", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6824661/6824662", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
