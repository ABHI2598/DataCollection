In this study, the authors introduce a preliminary set of analysis for assessing the performance of electronic systems such as radar, communications and navigation systems and the degrading/deteriorating effects of wind turbines. The analysis quantifies the performance degradation in the electronic systems. The proposed study can be used as a tool by decision makers in the planning and designing phases of both electronic systems and wind turbines to reduce the adverse effects of the wind farms on the mentioned systems."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:49", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Preliminary set of analysis for the assessment of wind turbines which are in the line-of-sight of radar, navigation and communications systems", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.017332S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Preliminary set of analysis for the assessment of wind turbines which are in the line-of-sight of radar, navigation and communications systems", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6824661/6824663", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
