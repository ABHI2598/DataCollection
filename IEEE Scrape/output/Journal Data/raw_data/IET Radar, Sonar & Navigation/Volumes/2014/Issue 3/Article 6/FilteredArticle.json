The authors regard the motion compensation as a multi-parameter estimation problem. Based on the designing structured Gram matrices optimisation method, a novel motion compensation method is presented. This method consists of two parts: the range alignment algorithm and the phase compensation algorithm. The former estimates the offset of each range profile by using a criterion, which makes correlations among all of the range profiles approaching to maximum values simultaneously. Also, the latter can extract phase errors by using the optimisation method to approach the ideal optimal matrix which is derived from analysis on the signal model. The measured data processing results show that the novel motion compensation method has strong robustness and high estimation accuracy."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "1", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"ipcClassList": "G01S0139000000", "order": "1", "id": "WO2015142418", "assignees": ["RAYTHEON CO"], "patentAbstract": "A system and method for high-availability inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR). In one embodiment a set of quadratic phase vectors, each corresponding to a different acceleration, is multiplied, one at a time, in a Hadamard product, with a 3 -dimensional data cube, and a fast Fourier transform (FFT) is taken of the result, to form a 2-dimensional array. The two-dimensional array is made sparse by setting to zero elements that fall below a threshold based on a coherency metric, and the sparse arrays are stacked to form a sparse 3- dimensional image. Projections of the sparse 3-dimensional image are formed for presentation to an operator or an image exploitation system.", "title": "HIGH-AVAILABILITY ISAR IMAGE FORMATION", "patentNumber": "WO2015142418", "filingDate": "21 January 2015", "appNum": "US2015012298", "ipcClasses": ["G01S0139000000"], "grantDate": "24 September 2015", "inventors": "MITCHELL, Benjamin; PATTERSON, Andrew J.; SAMANIEGO,Raymond", "patentLink": "https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2015142418&recNum=50&docAn=DE2014100299&queryString=&maxRec=2801215"}], "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T11:53:13", "isEarlyAccess": false, "publisher": "IET", "title": "Motion compensation algorithm based on the designing structured gram matrices method", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018517S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Motion compensation algorithm based on the designing structured gram matrices method", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6750808/6750814", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
