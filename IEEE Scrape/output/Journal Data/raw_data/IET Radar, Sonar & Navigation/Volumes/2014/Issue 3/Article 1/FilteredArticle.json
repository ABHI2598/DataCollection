Under least mean square error criterion, decompose the transmitted pulse and echo signal by wavelet transform firstly, then estimate the target's distance and velocity information on high level of wavelet decomposition, finally, generate detonator signal to drive the executive level. The simulation results show that this method can effectively estimate the distance and velocity of target, also it can reduce data volume of signal processing greatly without impacting the measurement which is good to the real-time processing and engineering applications."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7437983", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7437983", "pdfSize": "1324KB"}, "title": "A low-cost design of transceiver based on DWPT for WSN", "displayText": "Mouhamad Chehaitly, Mohamed Tabaa, Fabrice Monteiro, Abbas Dandache, Ali Hamie, \"A low-cost design of transceiver based on DWPT for WSN\", <em>Microelectronics (ICM) 2015 27th International Conference on</em>, pp. 43-46, 2015, ISSN 2159-1679.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7437997", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7437997", "pdfSize": "1239KB"}, "title": "A new WSN transceiver based on DWPT for WBAN applications", "displayText": "Safa Saadaoui, Mohamed Tabaa, Fabrice Monteiro, Abbas Dandache, Karim Alami, \"A new WSN transceiver based on DWPT for WBAN applications\", <em>Microelectronics (ICM) 2015 27th International Conference on</em>, pp. 99-102, 2015, ISSN 2159-1679.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6996984", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6996984", "pdfSize": "1842KB"}, "title": "A low-cost many-to-one WSN architecture based on UWB-IR and DWPT", "displayText": "Mohamed Tabaa, Camille Diou, \"A low-cost many-to-one WSN architecture based on UWB-IR and DWPT\", <em>Control Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT) 2014 International Conference on</em>, pp. 712-718, 2014.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T13:48:35", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Study of ultra-wideband fuze signal processing method based on wavelet transform", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.032833S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Study of ultra-wideband fuze signal processing method based on wavelet transform", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6750808/6750809", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
