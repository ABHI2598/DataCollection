A specific source of interest is an autonomous underwater vehicle with periodic sound transmissions. Given a simple horizontal linear receiving array, the authors develop a Bayesian tracking method based on measurements of signal arriving angle and difference of respective sonar transmission and receiving time intervals. To counter the multi-path effect and thus improve estimation accuracy of time differences, passive time reversal processing is exploited. Further, the unscented Kalman filter is adopted in tracking to handle nonlinearity in measurements. The proposed method is tested in simulations as well as an at-sea experiment, and the results validate the effectiveness of the developed approach."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7363053", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7363053", "pdfSize": "253KB"}, "title": "Acoustic Radar Weak Target Detection Method Based on Mellin Transform", "displayText": "Dinghe Wang, Qinglong Bao, Zengping Chen, \"Acoustic Radar Weak Target Detection Method Based on Mellin Transform\", <em>Computer and Information Technology; Ubiquitous Computing and Communications; Dependable Autonomic and Secure Computing; Pervasive Intelligence and Computing (CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM) 2015 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 64-67, 2015.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:21:48", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Bayesian passive acoustic tracking of a cooperative moving source in shallow water", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.022212S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Bayesian passive acoustic tracking of a cooperative moving source in shallow water", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6750808/6750813", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
