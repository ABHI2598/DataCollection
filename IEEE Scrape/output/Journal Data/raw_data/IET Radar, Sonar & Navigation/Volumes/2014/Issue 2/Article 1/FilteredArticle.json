A 2D spatial smoothing technique is also introduced to cope with the coherent behaviour of the received echoes, which may result in a rank deficiency of the signals covariance matrix. The algorithm is analysed with respect to its application to coherent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays. The extended baseline which is synthesised can indeed be used to further improve the performance of the system. The results of the algorithm are shown for both simulated and experimental data scenarios. In the latter case, the data are collected by a frequency-modulated continuous wave radar with MIMO functionality that has been designed and realised in cooperation with TNO, the Netherlands."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T13:57:36", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Coherent MUSIC technique for range/angle information retrieval: application to a frequency-modulated continuous wave MIMO radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.0185S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Coherent MUSIC technique for range/angle information retrieval: application to a frequency-modulated continuous wave MIMO radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6746872/6746874", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
