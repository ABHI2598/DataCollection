The five criteria are Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Hannan and Quinn Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Corrected AIC (AlCc) and the recently introduced Vector Corrected Kullback Information Criterion (KICvc) and Weighted-Average Information Criterion (WIC). The general form of the above information criteria consists of a log likelihood function expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix and a unique penalty term. In our estimation procedure, the number of signals is obtained by minimising each of the above criteria. Several simulated data sets, including a linear antenna array data set, are adopted for the comparison purpose. The authors show that, in simple MUSIC additive white noise model, for small sample size n, WIC performs nearly as well as AlCc and outperforms other criteria, and for moderately large to large n, WIC performs nearly as well as BIC and outperforms other criteria. Therefore when the authors are not certain of the relative sample size, WIC may be a practical alternative to any criterion. The main purpose is to draw the attention and interests of signal processing researchers to adopt more recent statistical model selection criteria, such as WIC, in general signal processing problems."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4814547", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814547", "pdfSize": "2285KB"}, "title": "A 77-GHz FMCW MIMO Radar Based on an SiGe Single-Chip Transceiver", "displayText": "Reinhard Feger, Christoph Wagner, Stefan Schuster, Stefan Scheiblhofer, Herbert Jager, Andreas Stelzer, \"A 77-GHz FMCW MIMO Radar Based on an SiGe Single-Chip Transceiver\", <em>Microwave Theory and Techniques IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 57, pp. 1020-1035, 2009, ISSN 0018-9480.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6384817", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6384817", "pdfSize": "2234KB"}, "title": "Flexible Detection Criterion for Source Enumeration in Array Processing", "displayText": "Zhihua Lu, Abdelhak M.
