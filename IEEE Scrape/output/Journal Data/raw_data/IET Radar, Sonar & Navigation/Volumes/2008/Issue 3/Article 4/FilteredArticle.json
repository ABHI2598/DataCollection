An algorithm based on the delineation of shadows using active contours constrained by a simple wire-frame building model has been developed and demonstrated using SAR imagery of a village on Salisbury plain. The core of the algorithm is a novel technique for target delineation involving multiple active contours evolving simultaneously. In particular, a technique referred to as multiple hypothesis delineation, in which contours can be in several states simultaneously, is developed and shown to lead to considerable improvement in convergence time and delineation accuracy when used to delineate multiple targets in close proximity. The technique is applied to the automatic estimation of building dimensions by delineation of shadows in a sequence of SAR images of an urban scene. The estimation of building dimensions is automatic; user interaction is limited identifying a building of interest and a region of background clutter close to the building. Results are presented for six different buildings, in each case two SAR images were used in the estimation process separated in illumination angle by either 28deg or 90deg. The estimates of building dimensions are compared with the actual building dimensions obtained from architectural drawings. The algorithm was found to perform robustly and provide reasonably accurate estimates of the building dimensions, typically within ~10% of the true values."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6876126", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876126", "pdfSize": "2098KB"}, "title": "Automatic Recognition of Isolated Buildings on Single-Aspect SAR Image Using Range Detector", "displayText": "Shanshan Chen, Haipeng Wang, Feng Xu, Ya-Qiu Jin, \"Automatic Recognition of Isolated Buildings on Single-Aspect SAR Image Using Range Detector\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 12, pp. 219-223, 2015, ISSN 1545-598X.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6573417", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6573417", "pdfSize": "1933KB"}, "title": "Facade Reconstruction Using Multiview Spaceborne TomoSAR Point Clouds", "displayText": "Xiao Xiang Zhu, Muhammad Shahzad, \"Facade Reconstruction Using Multiview Spaceborne TomoSAR Point Clouds\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 52, pp. 3541-3552, 2014, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5764772", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5764772", "pdfSize": "729KB"}, "title": "Building L-shape footprint extraction from high resolution SAR image", "displayText": "Fengli Zhang, Yun Shao, Xiao Zhang, Timo Balz, \"Building L-shape footprint extraction from high resolution SAR image\", <em>Urban Remote Sensing Event (JURSE) 2011 Joint</em>, pp. 273-276, 2011.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6008520", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008520", "pdfSize": "1913KB"}, "title": "Earthquake Damages Rapid Mapping by Satellite Remote Sensing Data: L'Aquila April 6th, 2009 Event", "displayText": "Fabio Dell'Acqua, Christian Bignami, Marco Chini, Gianni Lisini, Diego Aldo Polli, Salvatore Stramondo, \"Earthquake Damages Rapid Mapping by Satellite Remote Sensing Data: L'Aquila April 6th 2009 Event\", <em>Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 4, pp. 935-943, 2011, ISSN 1939-1404.", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7730911", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730911", "pdfSize": "450KB"}, "title": "Detection of building radar footprints from single VHR SAR images", "displayText": "Jinxing Chen, Fan Wu, Chao Wang, Wanming Lei, \"Detection of building radar footprints from single VHR SAR images\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2016 IEEE International</em>, pp. 7326-7329, 2016, ISSN 2153-7003.", "order": "5"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5337973", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337973", "pdfSize": "1694KB"}, "title": "Building Height Retrieval From VHR SAR Imagery Based on an Iterative Simulation and Matching Technique", "displayText": "Dominik Brunner, Guido Lemoine, Lorenzo Bruzzone, Harm Greidanus, \"Building Height Retrieval From VHR SAR Imagery Based on an Iterative Simulation and Matching Technique\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 48, pp. 1487-1504, 2010, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "6"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4779677", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779677", "pdfSize": "177KB"}, "title": "Extraction of Building Heights from VHR SAR Imagery using an Iterative Simulation and Match Procedure", "displayText": "Dominik Brunner, Guido Lemoine, Lorenzo Bruzzone, \"Extraction of Building Heights from VHR SAR Imagery using an Iterative Simulation and Match Procedure\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 2008.
