The coherency among the incident sources would reduce the data correlation matrix's rank to below the number of incident sources, but this proposed algorithm restores the rank by summing the individual particle-velocity-field component's data correlation matrices. This scheme uses identically oriented underwater-acoustic vector-hydrophones, its locations may be arbitrary. Each underwater-acoustic vector-hydrophone consists of two or three collocated but orthogonally oriented velocity-hydrophones, and a pressure-hydrophone. In contrast to the customary 'spatial smoothing' technique, this proposed PVFS algorithm does not reduce the array's spatial aperture and does not require any 'virtual array interpolation' even for an irregularly shaped array grid. Monte Carlo simulations verify this proposed scheme's efficacy."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5392981", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392981", "pdfSize": "545KB"}, "title": "Particle-Velocity-Field Difference Smoothing for Coherent Source Localization in Spatially Nonuniform Noise", "displayText": "Jin He, Shengli Jiang, Juting Wang, Zhong Liu, \"Particle-Velocity-Field Difference Smoothing for Coherent Source Localization in Spatially Nonuniform Noise\", <em>Oceanic Engineering IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 35, pp. 113-119, 2010, ISSN 0364-9059.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6763044", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763044", "pdfSize": "3984KB"}, "title": "An Hybrid Cram&#x00E9;r-Rao Bound in Closed Form for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation by an &#x201C;Acoustic Vector Sensor&#x201D; With Gain-Phase Uncertainties", "displayText": "Ping Kwan Tam, Kainam Thomas Wong, Yang Song, \"An Hybrid Cram&#x00E9;r-Rao Bound in Closed Form for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation by an &#x201C;Acoustic Vector Sensor&#x201D; With Gain-Phase Uncertainties\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 62, pp. 2504-2516, 2014, ISSN 1053-587X.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:27:29", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Direction-finding of coherent sources via 'particle-velocity-field smoothing'", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.040429S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Direction-finding of coherent sources via 'particle-velocity-field smoothing'", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4469857/4469864", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
