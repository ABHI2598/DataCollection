Since the frequency spectrum of the sweep signal varies against time, a novel algorithm, namely a time-frequency cross-correlation (TFCC) algorithm based on wavelet packet transform (WPT), is proposed to estimate the time delay of sweep signal. In this algorithm, the source sweep and the received signals are decomposed with WPT to obtain their time-frequency representations and the TFCC between the source sweep and the received signals is performed. Each reflected sweep in the received signal is converted into a time-frequency correlation peak whose position can indicate its time delay. The TFCC algorithm can suppress ambient noise effectively and improve the performance of sweep extraction and can match more precisely the source and the reflected sweeps to their known time-frequency characters. Numerical experiments were performed to compare the performance of the TFCC algorithm with that of the conventional cross- correlation and phase-data algorithms. The results proved that the TFCC algorithm can extract the reflected sweeps effectively and its performance is better than that of the conventional algorithms.", "isPromo": false, "publicationDate": "April 2008", "copyrightYear": "2007-2012", "isOpenAccess": false, "publisher": "IET", "articleId": "4469863", "issue": "2", "isDynamicHtml": false, "citationCount": "1", "htmlAbstractLink": "/document/4469863/", "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn:20070076", "accessionNumber": "9998057", "issn": [{"format": "Print ISSN", "value": "1751-8784"}, {"format": "Online ISSN", "value": "1751-8792"}], "isSMPTE": false, "isStandard": false, "userInfo": {"institute": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "guest": false, "member": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "fileCabinetContent": false, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "subscribedContent": false, "showGet802Link": false}, "isBook": false, "isFreeDocument": false, "isEarlyAccess": false}, "references": [], "citations": {"contentType": "periodicals", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4469857/4469863", "publisher": "IET", "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6864566", "pdfSize": "155KB", "documentLink": "/document/6864566", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "order": "1", "displayText": "Fangfang Jiang, Sijia Sun, \"Identity recognition based on power spectral analysis of pulse wave signal\", <em>Medical Imaging Physics and Engineering (ICMIPE) 2013 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 348-351, 2013.", "title": "Identity recognition based on power spectral analysis of pulse wave signal"}]}, "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:08:35", "mlTime": "PT0.02505S", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Sweep signal time-delay estimation with time-frequency cross-correlation algorithm", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "title": "Sweep signal time-delay estimation with time-frequency cross-correlation algorithm"}}
