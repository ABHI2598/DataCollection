For instance, many surface and maritime radar systems used for national border surveillance, traffic control, indoor surveillance, etc. must be able to operate in a congested electromagnetic environment without performance degradations caused by intentional external electromagnetic interference (EMI). Even greater demands are placed on military air, space, maritime and battlefield radar systems that must reliably operate in congested and hostile environments characterized by deliberate and adaptive jamming. In addition, many military missions require covert radar operation, which increases the complexity of radar signal processing."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6159738", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6159738", "pdfSize": "117KB"}, "title": "Analysis of mainlobe to mean square sidelobe ratio in noise radar", "displayText": "Yuanbing Cheng, Xiyuan Tang, Wei Zhang, Hong Gu, Weimin Su, \"Analysis of mainlobe to mean square sidelobe ratio in noise radar\", <em>Radar (Radar) 2011 IEEE CIE International Conference on</em>, vol. 2, pp. 1075-1078, 2011.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:50:30", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Signal Processing in Noise Radar Technology [Editorial]", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.02802S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Signal Processing in Noise Radar Technology [Editorial]", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4607165/4607166", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
