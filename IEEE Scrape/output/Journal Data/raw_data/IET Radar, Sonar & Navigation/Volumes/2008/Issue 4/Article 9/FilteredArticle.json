Towards this aim, two linear time-frequency (TF) transforms, short-time Fourier transform and local polynomial Fourier transform are used as a means of signal representation and filtering. The noise radar return signal is a wideband random signal occupying the whole TF plane, whereas the interference signal is well concentrated in the TF plane. This implies that the filtering of the received signal can be performed by using a binary mask to excise only a portion of the TF plane corrupted by the interference. Simulations carried out on the radar return signal corrupted by extremely strong non-stationary interferences confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7163304", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7163304", "pdfSize": "2677KB"}, "title": "Wideband Interference Mitigation in High-Resolution Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Data", "displayText": "Mingliang Tao, Feng Zhou, Zijing Zhang, \"Wideband Interference Mitigation in High-Resolution Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Data\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 54, pp. 74-87, 2016, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6237624", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6237624", "pdfSize": "1201KB"}, "title": "A Parametric Method for Multicomponent Interference Suppression in Noise Radars", "displayText": "Slobodan Djukanovic, Vesna Popovic, \"A Parametric Method for Multicomponent Interference Suppression in Noise Radars\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 48, pp. 2730-2738, 2012, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7326305", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326305", "pdfSize": "472KB"}, "title": "Correction of wide-band interference signatures in real measured synthetic aperture radar data", "displayText": "Mingliang Tao, Feng Zhou, Zijing Zhang, \"Correction of wide-band interference signatures in real measured synthetic aperture radar data\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2015 IEEE International</em>, pp. 2449-2452, 2015.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:33:51", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Time-frequency-based non-stationary interference suppression for noise radar systems", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.041852S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Time-frequency-based non-stationary interference suppression for noise radar systems", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4607165/4607174", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
