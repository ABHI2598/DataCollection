The new approach, termed as linearly constrained minimum-'normalized variance' beamformer (LCMNV), is formulated as one to minimise the normalised variance of the beamformer's output, subject to a pre-specified set of linear constraints. The normalised variance is defined as a pseudo-correlation function of the instantaneously adaptive, infinity-norm snapshot-normalised data, as an alternative to the customary 'fractional lower-order moments' (FLOM) for heavy-tailed impulsive noise environments. The proposed beamformer is in essence second-order statistics based, and produces an instantaneously scaled beamformer output. The LCMNV beamformer outperforms the FLOM beamformer with the following advantages: (i) computationally simpler with a closed-form solution, (ii) requiring no prior information or estimation of the effective characteristic exponents of the impulsive noises, (iii) applicable to a wider class of heavy-tailed impulsive noises and (iv) offering better interference-rejection ability."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5957376", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5957376", "pdfSize": "308KB"}, "title": "Normalized-Orthogonal Projection Beamforming Amid Heavy-Tailed Impulsive Noise of Unknown Statistics", "displayText": "Hongtao Li, Chen Gu, Xiaohua Zhu, \"Normalized-Orthogonal Projection Beamforming Amid Heavy-Tailed Impulsive Noise of Unknown Statistics\", <em>Multimedia and Signal Processing (CMSP) 2011 International Conference on</em>, vol. 1, pp. 79-82, 2011.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:28", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Linearly constrained minimum-'normalised variance' beamforming against heavy-tailed impulsive noise of unknown statistics", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.025943S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Linearly constrained minimum-'normalised variance' beamforming against heavy-tailed impulsive noise of unknown statistics", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4620124/4620131", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
