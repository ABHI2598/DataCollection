The proposed receiving system for radars is configured with multiple inverse filters so that it has different range resolutions depending on the detection range, and the signal is compressed to a narrow arbitrary pulse width of less than or equal to the reciprocal of the spectrum bandwidth of the transmitted signal. Then the proposed receiving system may be able to have no sidelobes. The frequency response function of each inverse filter used in the receiver is expressed as <i>D</i>(<i>f</i>)/<i>S</i>(<i>f</i>), where <i>D</i>(<i>f</i>) is the Fourier transform of the desired output waveform <i>d</i>(<i>t</i>) and <i>S</i>(<i>f</i>) is the Fourier transform of the transmitted waveform <i>s</i>(<i>t</i>). Specific signal examples are used to clarify what sort of <i>D</i>(<i>f</i>) and <i>S</i>(<i>f</i>) are suitable for preventing <i>D</i>(<i>f</i>)/<i>S</i>(<i>f</i>) from diverging. With regard to this proposed receiving system, a theoretical improvement factor is indicated for the signal-to-noise ratio, and simulations and experiments are conducted to confirm the validity of the proposed receiving system."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6233347", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6233347", "pdfSize": "399KB"}, "title": "Binary codes for multi-range resolution radars", "displayText": "Masanori Shinriki, Hiroshi Takase, \"Binary codes for multi-range resolution radars\", <em>Radar Symposium (IRS) 2012 13th International</em>, pp. 359-364, 2012, ISSN 2155-5753.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7226258", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226258", "pdfSize": "548KB"}, "title": "Search of binary pulse compression codes for multi-range-resolution radar", "displayText": "Hiroshi Takase, Masanori Shinriki, \"Search of binary pulse compression codes for multi-range-resolution radar\", <em>Radar Symposium (IRS) 2015 16th International</em>, pp. 1088-1093, 2015.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5555647", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555647", "pdfSize": "304KB"}, "title": "An approach for extracting the transmitted waveforms based on compound filter for MIMO radar", "displayText": "Yu Zhang, Jianxin Wang, \"An approach for extracting the transmitted waveforms based on compound filter for MIMO radar\", <em>Signal Processing Systems (ICSPS) 2010 2nd International Conference on</em>, vol. 1, pp. V1-665-V1-667, 2010.", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6850174", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6850174", "pdfSize": "3521KB"}, "title": "Binary codes for multirange-resolution radar and pulse-compression properties", "displayText": "Masanori Shinriki, Hiroshi Takase, \"Binary codes for multirange-resolution radar and pulse-compression properties\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 50, pp. 1549-1555, 2014, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4895603", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895603", "pdfSize": "473KB"}, "title": "Mismatched filter for binary code compressed to several chips", "displayText": "Kazutaka Hamada, Masanori Shinriki, \"Mismatched filter for binary code compressed to several chips\", <em>Information Theory and Its Applications 2008.
