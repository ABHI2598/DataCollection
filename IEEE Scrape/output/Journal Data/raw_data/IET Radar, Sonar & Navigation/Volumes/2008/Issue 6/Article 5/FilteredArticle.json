The waveguide experiment describes in detail the procedure of active TR location and shows that (i) the extended target could have multiple distinguishable eigenstates, unlike point-like targets in which one target corresponds to one eigenstate; (ii) the selective location can be achieved by means of the standard TR location in the presence of the suspended and bottom objects; (iii) compared with the standard TR location, TR MUSIC location based on signal subspaces performs better in locating non-resolved targets and has lower sidelobe levels to locate the extended target. Finally, the approach of acquiring the TR operator via array probing by weighting Hadamard-Walsh functions (to produce orthogonal beams) is discussed. The experimental result shows that the ambiguity surfaces of the standard TR location and the TR MUSIC location are greatly improved with this approach."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:53", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Experimental investigation of selective localisation by decomposition of the time reversal operator and subspace-based technique", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018928S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Experimental investigation of selective localisation by decomposition of the time reversal operator and subspace-based technique", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4620124/4620129", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
