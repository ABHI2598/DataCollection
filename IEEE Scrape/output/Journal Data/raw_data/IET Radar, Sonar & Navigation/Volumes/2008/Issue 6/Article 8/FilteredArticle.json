The received signal models under two hypotheses, <i>H</i> <sub>0</sub> and <i>H</i> <sub>1</sub>, are assumed to be the same, except that the target amplitude is zero under <i>H</i> <sub>0</sub>. Using the Bayesian approach, it is shown that the likelihood ratio can be calculated as the ratio of the prior to posterior probabilities of the target amplitude. Based on this relation, a new method for target detection in Gaussian clutter is presented. This method is applied to cases with both known and unknown clutter statistics and in each case, white and coloured clutters are considered. Simulation results show that the proposed detector has a much better performance compared with conventional generalised likelihood ratio test detectors."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5591000", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5591000", "pdfSize": "193KB"}, "title": "An Adaptive Radar Detection for the Target in Clutter with Unknown Covariance Based on the PPPT", "displayText": "Jinkun Cao, Gang Chen, \"An Adaptive Radar Detection for the Target in Clutter with Unknown Covariance Based on the PPPT\", <em>Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC) 2010 2nd International Conference on</em>, vol. 2, pp. 294-297, 2010.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:35:26", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Radar detection based on Bayesian estimation of target amplitude", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.024454S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Radar detection based on Bayesian estimation of target amplitude", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4620124/4620132", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
