The aim of this development is to increase the accuracy of estimates of inertial state vectors in all the network nodes, including the navigation states, and also to improve the fault tolerance of inertial network systems. An analysis of distributed inertial sensing models is presented and new distributed data fusion algorithms are developed for inertial network systems. The distributed data fusion algorithm comprises two steps: inertial measurement fusion and state fusion. The inertial measurement fusion allows each node to assimilate all the inertial measurements from an inertial network system, which can improve the performance of inertial sensor failure detection and isolation algorithms by providing more information. The state fusion further increases the accuracy and enhances the integrity of the local inertial states and navigation state estimates. The simulation results show that the two-step fusion procedure overcomes the disadvantages of traditional inertial sensor alignment procedures. The slave inertial nodes can be accurately aligned to the master node."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6896610", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6896610", "pdfSize": "226KB"}, "title": "Distributed attitude transfer alignment research based on INS/CNS integrated navigation system", "displayText": "Bing Hua, Jing Yang, Zhi Xiong, Hai-ying Liu, Guo-hua Kang, Wei-xing Qian, \"Distributed attitude transfer alignment research based on INS/CNS integrated navigation system\", <em>Control Conference (CCC) 2014 33rd Chinese</em>, pp. 136-141, 2014, ISSN 1934-1768.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7530551", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7530551", "pdfSize": "185KB"}, "title": "Inertial sensor arrays \u2014 A literature review", "displayText": "John-Olof Nilsson, Isaac Skog, \"Inertial sensor arrays \u2014 A literature review\", <em>Navigation Conference (ENC) 2016 European</em>, pp. 1-10, 2016.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6974745", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6974745", "pdfSize": "396KB"}, "title": "A Fault Tolerant Architecture for Data Fusion Targeting Hardware and Software Faults", "displayText": "Bader Kaci, Lussier Benjamin, Sch&#x00F6;n, \"A Fault Tolerant Architecture for Data Fusion Targeting Hardware and Software Faults\", <em>Dependable Computing (PRDC) 2014 IEEE 20th Pacific Rim International Symposium on</em>, pp. 1-10, 2014.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T14:41:34", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Distributed data fusion algorithms for inertial network systems", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.040545S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Distributed data fusion algorithms for inertial network systems", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4437845/4437852", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
