The technique is based on reconstructing range sub-profiles. With respect to previous methods, the proposed technique can be applied to any kind of SWFs. Moreover, for a given range resolution, long range profiles can be formed without increasing the number of transmitted frequencies. Theoretical results are also derived that provide a correct setting of waveform and processing parameter. Finally, as case studies, the proposed method is applied to three SFWs, namely short-pulse stepped-frequency, linear frequency modulated stepped frequency and phase-coded stepped-frequency waveforms. Simulations prove the effectiveness of the proposed range profile reconstruction."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6880815", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6880815", "pdfSize": "815KB"}, "title": "RFI Suppression Based on Phase-Coded Stepped-Frequency Waveform in Through-Wall Radar", "displayText": "Tingjun Li, Haining Yang, Zheng-ou Zhou, \"RFI Suppression Based on Phase-Coded Stepped-Frequency Waveform in Through-Wall Radar\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 53, pp. 1583-1591, 2015, ISSN 0196-2892.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5274459", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5274459", "pdfSize": "113KB"}, "title": "Target range profiling algorithm for airborne microwave sensor detection system", "displayText": "Hu Xiujuan, Deng Jiahao, Zhou Zhifeng, Sang Huiping, \"Target range profiling algorithm for airborne microwave sensor detection system\", <em>Electronic Measurement & Instruments 2009.
