In an effort to approach the ideal interference-free performance, the range-domain 'beamforming' properties of the recently developed multistatic adaptive pulse compression (MAPC) algorithm is herein combined with the well-known CLEAN algorithm which operates on an interference-subtraction basis. Two versions of this hybridised methodology are presented and compared. To ascertain relative sensitivity, both the mean-squared error and the probability of detection are examined as a function of SNR when in the presence of multistatic interference. It is demonstrated that the respective merits of MAPC and CLEAN can be used to offset the limitations of the other and thereby combine to provide significant additional sensitivity improvement."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7771665", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771665", "pdfSize": "4278KB"}, "title": "Overview of radar waveform diversity", "displayText": "Shannon D.
