Two significant improvements to the particle-filter implementation of the PHD-based multitarget, multisensor tracker for PCL are introduced. The first is a simple, yet novel, peak-extraction technique that exploits the integral property of the PHD and provides a faster and more accurate method over currently used techniques to extract the target states from the PHD. The second is an improved method of placing birth particles, whereby a precomputed range-variance-based grid and a least-squares iterative technique is used to place birth particles at the bistatic range and Doppler observation intersections. This leads to greater reliability in detecting targets and a significant reduction in the number of particles required for tracking."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7039662", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7039662", "pdfSize": "354KB"}, "title": "MMOSPA-based track extraction in the PHD filter - a justification for k-means clustering", "displayText": "Marcus Baum, Peter Willett, Uwe D.
