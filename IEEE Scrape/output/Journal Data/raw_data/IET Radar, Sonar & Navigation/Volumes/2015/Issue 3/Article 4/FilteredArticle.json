The goal is a planning algorithm that provides a path for each platform in such a way that the collection of platforms cooperatively sense the environment in a globally efficient manner. The environment is described by a spatially non-homogeneous priority function. The method samples this function to produce a discrete collection of locales that the platforms use as waypoints. The key feature of the method is to treat the assignment of locales to platforms as a target tracking problem and to use the probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker (PMHT) as a method of performing multi-platform batch data association. This paper introduces the PMHT path planner (PMHT-pp) and compares this algorithm as a method of performing multiple platform batch data association with the Genetic Algorithm to solve the modified multi-travelling salesman problem."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7402161", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7402161", "pdfSize": "417KB"}, "title": "Fast Metric Multi-Object Vehicle Tracking for Dynamical Environment Comprehension", "displayText": "Francisco A.R.
