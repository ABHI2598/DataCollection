After compensating the translational motion, the second-order phase coefficients of the range echoes are a linear polynomial of the rotating angular velocity and range geometry. In this study, a novel method for estimating the rotating angular velocity of the targets with dominant scatters is proposed. The range cells where the amplitudes have smaller normalised variances are selected, and then frequency domain windowing is applied to extract echoes of dominant scatters. Based on the discrete polynomial-phase transform, the second-order phase coefficients of the strong scatter echoes are estimated, and thus the rotating angular velocity can be obtained through the least-square-error method. Simulated and real-data results have shown the effectiveness and robustness of this method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7401056", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7401056", "pdfSize": "2210KB"}, "title": "Joint Cross-Range Scaling and 3D Geometry Reconstruction of ISAR Targets Based on Factorization Method", "displayText": "Lei Liu, Feng Zhou, Xue-Ru Bai, Ming-Liang Tao, Zi-Jing Zhang, \"Joint Cross-Range Scaling and 3D Geometry Reconstruction of ISAR Targets Based on Factorization Method\", <em>Image Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 25, pp. 1740-1750, 2016, ISSN 1057-7149.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7310852", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7310852", "pdfSize": "1289KB"}, "title": "Adaptive Translational Motion Compensation Method for ISAR Imaging Under Low SNR Based on Particle Swarm Optimization", "displayText": "Lei Liu, Feng Zhou, Mingliang Tao, Pange Sun, Zijing Zhang, \"Adaptive Translational Motion Compensation Method for ISAR Imaging Under Low SNR Based on Particle Swarm Optimization\", <em>Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 8, pp. 5146-5157, 2015, ISSN 1939-1404.", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7358084", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358084", "pdfSize": "2479KB"}, "title": "Human Movements Separation Based on Principle Component Analysis", "displayText": "Xiaoran Shi, Feng Zhou, Mingliang Tao, Zijing Zhang, \"Human Movements Separation Based on Principle Component Analysis\", <em>Sensors Journal IEEE</em>, vol. 16, pp. 2017-2027, 2016, ISSN 1530-437X.", "order": "3"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:45", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Cross-range scaling method of inverse synthetic aperture radar image based on discrete polynomial-phase transform", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.042703S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Cross-range scaling method of inverse synthetic aperture radar image based on discrete polynomial-phase transform", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7054575/7054587", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "3"}}
