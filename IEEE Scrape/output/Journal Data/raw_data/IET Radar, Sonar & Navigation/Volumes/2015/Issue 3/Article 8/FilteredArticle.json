With the HPRF radar, each ambiguous range measurement corresponds to a set of unambiguous range measurements. Both algorithms enable false track discrimination (FTD) using the probability of target existence. One approach adapts the Gaussian mixture measurement likelihood-integrated track splitting to the problem, where each measurement likelihood is approximated by a Gaussian mixture. The other approach is an integration of previously published multiple models approach with the probability of target existence paradigm. Here each model is a separate probabilistic data association filter. In both cases the track trajectory probability density function is a Gaussian mixture."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:46", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Target tracking in clutter using a high pulse repetition frequency radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019469S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Target tracking in clutter using a high pulse repetition frequency radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7054575/7054585", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
