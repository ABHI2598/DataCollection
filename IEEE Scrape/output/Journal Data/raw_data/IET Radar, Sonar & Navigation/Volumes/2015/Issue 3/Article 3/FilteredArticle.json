The optimum filter for MIMO-STAP is described as a separable filter, and the optimal weight vector in high dimension can be iteratively solved by three lower dimension weight vectors. Consequently, the quite high sample support and computational complexity in optimal MIMO-STAP can be efficiently reduced. For short data records, the proposed method can achieve better clutter suppression performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:44", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Reduced-dimension clutter suppression method for airborne multiple-input multiple-output radar based on three iterations", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018252S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reduced-dimension clutter suppression method for airborne multiple-input multiple-output radar based on three iterations", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7054575/7054600", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
