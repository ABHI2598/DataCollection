The proposed algorithm is based on a data matrix and estimates DOD and DOA without a pairing operation. The computational complexity of the proposed joint ESPRIT algorithm is derived to be less than that of conventional two dimension multiple signal classification (2D-MUSIC) and reduced dimension multiple signal classification. The authors' simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves performance very close to that of 2D-MUSIC and better performance than that of the ESPRIT algorithm."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7753688", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753688", "pdfSize": "1160KB"}, "title": "DOA estimation in monostatic MIMO array based on sparse signal reconstruction", "displayText": "Wentao Shi, Jianguo Huang, Qunfei Zhang, Jimeng Zheng, \"DOA estimation in monostatic MIMO array based on sparse signal reconstruction\", <em>Signal Processing Communications and Computing (ICSPCC) 2016 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2016.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:47", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Joint estimation of direction of departure and direction of arrival for multiple-input multiple-output radar based on improved joint ESPRIT method", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.025671S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Joint estimation of direction of departure and direction of arrival for multiple-input multiple-output radar based on improved joint ESPRIT method", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7054575/7054593", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
