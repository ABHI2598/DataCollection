However, it has been well recognised that wind turbines (WTs) may cause severe interferences on radar systems because of their scattering and motional behaviour. In this study, a novel signal model for pulse-Doppler radars (PDRs) which considers time-varying scattering and complicated motional characteristics of WTs is introduced. Using the proposed model, some applications including WT detection, construction of WT detection probability distribution and assessment of the detection performance of a target in the vicinity of a WT are demonstrated. In addition, an analytical and probabilistic model for WT clutter (WTC) is developed with the help of the proposed signal model. The signal model, applications and WTC model put forth within this study would be helpful in determining the deteriorating WT effects on PDRs before mitigation or other advanced processes to overcome WT effects."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7497361", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7497361", "pdfSize": "1392KB"}, "title": "Micro-Doppler-based classification study on the detections of aerial targets and wind turbines", "displayText": "Osman Karabay\u0131r, Senem Makal Y\u00fcceda\u011f, Okan Mert Y\u00fcceda\u011f, Ahmet Faruk Co\u015fkun, H\u00fcseyin Avni Serim, \"Micro-Doppler-based classification study on the detections of aerial targets and wind turbines\", <em>Radar Symposium (IRS) 2016 17th International</em>, pp. 1-4, 2016, ISSN 2155-5753.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7411894", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7411894", "pdfSize": "1744KB"}, "title": "Analysis of multiband monostatic and bistatic radar signatures of wind turbines", "displayText": "Francesco Fioranelli, Matthew Ritchie, Hugh Griffiths, Alessio Balleri, \"Analysis of multiband monostatic and bistatic radar signatures of wind turbines\", <em>Radar Conference 2015 IEEE</em>, pp. 277-282, 2015.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:40", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Wind turbine signal modelling approach for pulse Doppler radars and applications", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.030964S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Wind turbine signal modelling approach for pulse Doppler radars and applications", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7054575/7054608", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
