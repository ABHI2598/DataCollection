Local false track discrimination uses a track quality measure to confirm most of the true tracks, and to terminate most of the false tracks. Confirmed tracks are transmitted for track-to-track fusion. The sets of tracks being considered for fusion may contain both true and false tracks. The authors assume that each track information also includes the track quality measure in the form of the probability of target existence information. This information is used for additional false track discrimination at the fusion centre. They also use this information to enhance the track-to-track association. They propose three different strategies for track fusion with the target existence information: the `single target', the `joint multitarget' and the `linear multitarget'."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:39", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Track-to-track fusion with target existence", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.016876S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Track-to-track fusion with target existence", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7054575/7054584", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
