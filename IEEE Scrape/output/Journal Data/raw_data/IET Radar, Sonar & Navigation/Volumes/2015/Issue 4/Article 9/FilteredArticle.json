It is a classical universal interference for high-frequency surface wave radar, which can provide the capabilities of target monitoring and ocean remote sensing by working on HF band. In this study, the authors propose the superiorities of utilising the space-time adaptive processing-based algorithm for meteor trail suppression. They modify the calculation of the covariance matrix based on the distribution and characteristics of meteor trail aiming to fit for meteor trail better. Finally, they verify the effectiveness of the modified algorithm by measured data. The results show that the modified algorithm can not only detect targets better, but can also make Bragg lines buried in meteor trail visible."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:54", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Space-time adaptive processing-based algorithm for meteor trail suppression in high-frequency surface wave radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.017957S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Space-time adaptive processing-based algorithm for meteor trail suppression in high-frequency surface wave radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7070506/7070584", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
