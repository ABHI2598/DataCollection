Two novel consensus-based multiple-model filters are presented. Simulation experiments in a tracking case study, involving a strongly manoeuvring target and a sensor network characterised by weak connectivity, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed distributed multiple-mode filters with respect to existing solutions."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:50", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Consensus-based multiple-model Bayesian filtering for distributed tracking", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.017171S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Consensus-based multiple-model Bayesian filtering for distributed tracking", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7070506/7070563", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
