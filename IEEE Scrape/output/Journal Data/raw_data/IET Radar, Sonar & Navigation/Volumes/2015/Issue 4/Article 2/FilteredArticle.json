The operating principles of the algorithm are described analytically. The results of the experimental testing with algorithms are presented and discussed. The performance of synchronisation results are calibrated by image inspection compared with theoretical counterparts. It is experimentally shown that the algorithm can handle data acquired both from GPS, GLONASS and Galileo with sufficient level of accuracy."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7485143", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7485143", "pdfSize": "2515KB"}, "title": "Bistatic ISAR imaging based on phase synchronization with fiber optic link", "displayText": "Jie Tian, Yongsheng Cheng, Nan Xie, Dong Hou, \"Bistatic ISAR imaging based on phase synchronization with fiber optic link\", <em>Radar Conference (RadarConf) 2016 IEEE</em>, pp. 1-5, 2016, ISSN 2375-5318.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:54", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Generic signal synchronisation algorithm for passive global navigation satellite system-based synthetic aperture radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.02379S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Generic signal synchronisation algorithm for passive global navigation satellite system-based synthetic aperture radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7070506/7070573", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
