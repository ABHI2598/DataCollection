With I/Q imbalance compensation, the proposed receiver can maintain high instantaneous dynamic range and cover multiple Nyquist zones thus reducing the receiver's sampling rate requirement. Simulation results are presented to verify validity of the proposed method. The limitations of the proposed method and possible solutions are also discussed."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:52", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Wideband receiver with I/Q channels for multiple Nyquist zone coverage", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.01544S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Wideband receiver with I/Q channels for multiple Nyquist zone coverage", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7070506/7070597", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
