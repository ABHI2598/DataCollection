Traditional interference suppression methods need to detect the interferences, excise the corrupted data and reconstruct the data via interpolation. The detection is the precondition of the subsequent steps. In the cases where the interferences are weak, the traditional methods cannot efficiently detect and suppress them. In this study, the authors propose a novel interference suppression method based on matrix recovery. The proposed method formulates the interference suppression as a matrix recovery problem and solves the convex optimisation problem via the augmented Lagrange multiplier method. Unlike the traditional methods, the proposed method does not need the detection, excising and interpolation steps. The proposed algorithm can suppress not only the interferences including the weak and strong ones but also the noise. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7475887", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7475887", "pdfSize": "440KB"}, "title": "Computationally Efficient Transient Interference Excision Method for Skywave Over-the-Horizon Radar", "displayText": "Ziwei Liu, Hongtao Su, Qinzhen Hu, Zengfei Cheng, \"Computationally Efficient Transient Interference Excision Method for Skywave Over-the-Horizon Radar\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 13, pp. 1017-1021, 2016, ISSN 1545-598X.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:52", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Transient interference and noise suppression by complex matrix recovery with Hankel constraint", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.022009S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Transient interference and noise suppression by complex matrix recovery with Hankel constraint", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7070506/7070540", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
