This method is as an effective electronic protection technique against some electronic intelligence-based electronic attacks. Security enhancement of the mentioned scheme is discussed and some autocorrelation properties of it are investigated. Probabilities of false alarm and detection in case of using a block cipher generated phase-code are also studied. A new method for countering the effects of repeater jammers and digital radio frequency memories is also proposed which is based on block cipher encryption key update. This new method tries to implement a low probability of identification radar. All of the mentioned subjects are investigated by mathematical equations and simulation verifications."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:55", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Pulse compression security enhancement as an electronic protection technique by exploiting a block cipher output as phase-code", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018051S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Pulse compression security enhancement as an electronic protection technique by exploiting a block cipher output as phase-code", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7070506/7070610", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
