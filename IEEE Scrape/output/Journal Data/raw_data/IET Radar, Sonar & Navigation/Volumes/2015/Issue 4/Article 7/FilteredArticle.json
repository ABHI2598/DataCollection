Conventional 3D turntable ISAR imaging requires data collection over densely azimuth-elevation samples, which needs a large amount of data storage. In this study, an effective 3D ISAR imaging algorithm for turntable model based on compressive sensing is proposed, which exploits the sparsity in the image domain to achieve 3D reconstruction by using a limited number of measurements. Firstly, the 3D data tensor is converted into a 2D matrix by stacking slices of data along one specific dimension; then a 2D optimisation reconstruction approach is applied to solve a sparsity-driven optimisation problem to obtain the 2D distribution of the scatterers. Lastly, 3D ISAR images are generated by rearranging the scatterer distribution in the 2D map into a 3D volume. This imaging scheme only needs a small number of measurements, and reduces the required memory and computational burden significantly. Simulation results are finally shown to validate the proposed algorithm."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7399675", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7399675", "pdfSize": "2371KB"}, "title": "Three-Dimensional Interferometric ISAR Imaging for the Ship Target Under the Bi-Static Configuration", "displayText": "Yong Wang, Xuelu Li, \"Three-Dimensional Interferometric ISAR Imaging for the Ship Target Under the Bi-Static Configuration\", <em>Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 9, pp. 1505-1520, 2016, ISSN 1939-1404.", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7420706", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7420706", "pdfSize": "8759KB"}, "title": "3D Geometry and Motion Estimations of Maneuvering Targets for Interferometric ISAR With Sparse Aperture", "displayText": "Gang Xu, Mengdao Xing, Xiang-Gen Xia, Lei Zhang, Qianqian Chen, Zheng Bao, \"3D Geometry and Motion Estimations of Maneuvering Targets for Interferometric ISAR With Sparse Aperture\", <em>Image Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 25, pp. 2005-2020, 2016, ISSN 1057-7149.", "order": "2"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:50", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Three-dimensional inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging based on compressive sensing", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.032691S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Three-dimensional inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging based on compressive sensing", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7070506/7070608", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "2"}}
