A linear dependency of phase on radius in the radar echoes in the phantom model showed that the information regarding the radius of a circular, cylindrical object depended on the clutter environment: in a low-clutter case two distinct reflections were identified, whereas in the high-clutter case it was possible to extract a proxy. Radar echoes from antennas strapped to the back of a human subject showed a clear signature from a discernible, distinct reflector believed to be the aorta. However, as for the high-clutter case, only a proxy for aortic radius is available as basis for estimation, which is most likely coupled with aortic displacements."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7109120", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7109120", "pdfSize": "1182KB"}, "title": "On the Opportunities and Challenges in Microwave Medical Sensing and Imaging", "displayText": "Rohit Chandra, Huiyuan Zhou, Ilangko Balasingham, Ram M.
