It is more intractable when the NSLAR operates at high pulse repetition frequency (HPRF). In this study, a cascaded algorithm is presented to realise clutter suppression for NSLAR with HPRF. A novel orthogonal-waveform-based elevation adaptive beamforming method is proposed to suppress range-dependent near-range clutter at the first stage, and the residual range-independent far-range clutter is suppressed by azimuth-Doppler space-time adaptive processing (STAP) at the second stage. The proposed elevation beamformer can provide excellent performance on near-range clutter suppression because of the developed secondary data selection strategy. After suppression of the range-dependent near-range clutter, the range independency of clutter samples is enhanced evidently. Hence, the clutter suppression performance obtained by azimuth-Doppler STAP methods could be improved dramatically. Numerical examples are given to verify the validity of the proposed algorithm."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7493167", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7493167", "pdfSize": "213KB"}, "title": "Localization in MISO airborne passive radar through heavy ground clutters", "displayText": "Mohammad J.
