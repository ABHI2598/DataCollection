If the pulse repetition frequency is chosen so high that radar clutter is range ambiguous, then additional blind velocities at short-range induced by far-range clutter will occur. To eliminate these additional blind velocities, an efficient beamspace-based adaptive prefiltering method in elevation is proposed in this study to suppress ambiguous far-range clutter. The proposed beamformer can provide nearly optimal adapted elevation pattern because of the improved training data selection strategy. After eliminating the impact of ambiguous far-range clutter, the Doppler-compensation-based space-time adaptive processing method could be carried out to suppress residual range-dependent short-range clutter. In addition, the proposed prefiltering method is computationally efficient, and hence it is suitable for engineering application."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:49", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Short-range ground moving target indication in forward looking airborne radar based on elevation prefiltering", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019685S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Short-range ground moving target indication in forward looking airborne radar based on elevation prefiltering", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7046026/7046305", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
