A generalised persymmetric parametric adaptive coherence estimator (GPer-PACE) detector is proposed, where the disturbance is modelled as a multichannel autoregressive process. To mitigate the effect of limited training samples, the subspatial aperture smoothing is performed in the design of the authors' GPer-PACE detector. Moreover, the persymmetric structure information is exploited to further reduce the sample requirements. The performance of the GPer-PACE is assessed by numerical examples. The results show that the GPer-PACE outperforms other traditional detectors in sample-deficient scenarios."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:50", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Generalised persymmetric parametric adaptive coherence estimator for multichannel adaptive signal detection", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.017119S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Generalised persymmetric parametric adaptive coherence estimator for multichannel adaptive signal detection", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7095651/7095713", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
