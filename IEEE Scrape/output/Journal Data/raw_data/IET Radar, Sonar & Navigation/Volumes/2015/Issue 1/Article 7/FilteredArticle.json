However, another spreading mechanism of the clutter Doppler spectrum exists in onshore bistatic high frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR), which is presented in this study. Based on the space-time distribution of the first-order sea clutter in onshore bistatic HFSWR, the spreading model is proposed, which is verified by the simulation and experimental results. It demonstrates that the space-time model would be of fundamental importance to the future experimental investigations, not only of target detection but also of ocean remote sensing with onshore bistatic HFSWR."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:41", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Space-time model of the first-order sea clutter in onshore bistatic high frequency surface wave radar", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.021768S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Space-time model of the first-order sea clutter in onshore bistatic high frequency surface wave radar", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7021979/7021990", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
