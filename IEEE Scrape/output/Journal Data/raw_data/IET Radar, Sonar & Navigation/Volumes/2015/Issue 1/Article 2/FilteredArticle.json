The sensors provide an imperfect target detection and measurement environment, complicated by clutter measurements. The vast majority of published target tracking algorithms assume that the probability of target detection is independent of the trajectory state. This assumption is often incorrect, with subsequent degradation in the target tracking performance. The authors present two multitarget trackers which incorporate the state-dependent probability of target detection, each of which improves upon the state of the art capabilities of target tracking in such environments."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:42", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Multitarget tracking with state dependent detection", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.017847S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Multitarget tracking with state dependent detection", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7021979/7021989", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
