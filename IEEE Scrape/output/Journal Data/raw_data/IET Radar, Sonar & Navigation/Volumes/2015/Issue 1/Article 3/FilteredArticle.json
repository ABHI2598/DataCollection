This has been motivated by the need to develop improved detection processes to operate in high grazing angle clutter as exemplified by returns acquired from the Defence Science and Technology Organisation's Ingara radar. A minimum-based detector has the greatest resilience to clutter transitions and interfering targets. However, it has been shown recently that a minimum-based detector for the Pareto environment has a tendency to saturate. Using a simple transformation, progress is made towards the development of a useful incoherent detection scheme. Its performance is then analysed in both synthetic and real clutter."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7812897", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7812897", "pdfSize": "624KB"}, "title": "Analysis of a dual order statistic constant false alarm rate detector", "displayText": "Graham Weinberg, Aris Alexopoulos, \"Analysis of a dual order statistic constant false alarm rate detector\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 52, pp. 2567-2574, 2016, ISSN 0018-9251.", "order": "1"}]}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:43", "publisher": "IET", "title": "Development of an improved minimum order statistic detection process for Pareto distributed clutter", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.02143S", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Development of an improved minimum order statistic detection process for Pareto distributed clutter", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7021979/7021980", "publicationNumber": "4119394", "ieeeCitationCount": "1"}}
