This is performed by a transformation operator. However, the existing transformation operator is not practical because its transformation time increases exponentially with system size. To overcome this difficulty, this paper proposes a new method of transforming the Availability expression of a system into the corresponding Failure Frequency expression of the system. This method is based on a matrix approach using a 2 /spl times/ 2 matrix consisting of 0, Availability, and Failure Frequency in an appropriate manner. This transformation also enables algorithms for computing the Availability of a system to be transformed into algorithms for computing its Failure Frequency by replacing parameters and operations with matrix parameters and operations. The computation time after transformation is linear with respect to the original Availability algorithm. This implies that the problems of computing other well-known reliability measures including, Availability, Unavailability, MTBF, MTTR, MCT, Failure Rate, Failure Rate, and Failure Frequency, are reduced to only the Availability computation problem.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "false", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1638408", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34350", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Transformation+from+availability+expression+to+failure+frequency+expression&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2006&author=M.+Hayashi&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.874917&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=252&endPage=261&volumeNum=55&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "4", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Availability", "Frequency measurement", "Input variables", "Associate members", "Matrices", "Reliability engineering", "Time measurement"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["mathematical operators", "reliability theory", "failure analysis", "matrix algebra"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["differential operator", "failure frequency expression", "transformation operator", "matrix approach", "reliability", "MTBF", "MTTR", "MCT", "failure rate", "availability computation problem"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["system", "Differential operator", "failure frequency"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2006", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Transformation from availability expression to failure frequency expression", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "55", "accessionNumber": "8942998"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/ielx5/24/34350/1638408/html/img", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "1", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "06 October 2009", "inventors": "Burnham, Steven", "patentNumber": "7600202", "ipcClassList": "G06F0175000", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US7600202.pdf", "title": "TECHNIQUES FOR PROVIDING A FAILURES IN TIME FIT RATE FOR A PRODUCT DESIGN PROCESS", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "716136000", "pocClasses": ["716136000"], "filingDate": "14 September 2006", "id": "07600202", "patentAbstract": "A technique for providing a product FIT rate is performed within electronic circuitry (e.g., one or more computerized devices).
