Several generalizations of the logistic distribution, and certain related models, are proposed in this paper. The corresponding density functions involve an additional parameter, denoted by q, which allows for increased flexibility for modeling purposes; in fact, the larger this parameter is, the lower the mode of the resulting distribution will be. Generalizations of the type-1 and type-2 beta distributions are introduced, along with their logistic-type counterparts; the moments and cumulants of the latter are also derived. Other extensions are discussed including a q-analog of the generalized type-2 beta model, a q-extended generalized logistic distribution, and q-analogs of generalizations of the Dirichlet distribution. As is shown graphically, the proposed univariate distributions can generate a wide array of unimodal or symmetric bimodal curves."}, "references": [{"title": "Estimation of latent group effect", "context": [{"text": " For instance, [1] made use of a three-parameter logistic model due to [2] in connection with the reliability of a certain item, and [3] resorted to a logistic-type function in the context of statistical diagnostic and predictive reliability.
