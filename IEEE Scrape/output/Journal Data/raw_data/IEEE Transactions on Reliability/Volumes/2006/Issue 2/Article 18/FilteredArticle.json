It is a next step in an evolution of parallel and distributed computing. Due to the large scale and complexity of the grid system, its performance and reliability are difficult to model, analyse, and evaluate. This paper presents a model that relaxes some assumptions unsuitable for grid computing systems that have been made in the existed works studying the distributed systems. The paper proposes a virtual tree model of the grid service. This model simplifies the physical structure of a grid service, allows service performance (execution time) to be estimated, and takes into account the common cause failures in communication channels. Based on the model, an algorithm for evaluating the grid service performance distribution and the service reliability indices is suggested. The algorithm is based on graph theory, and Bayesian analysis. Illustrative examples are presented in which the results of the suggested algorithm are compared with simulation results."}, "references": [{"title": "The Grid 2: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure", "context": [{"text": "GRID computing [1] is a newly developed technology for complex systems with large-scale resource sharing, wide-area communication, and multi-institutional collaboration [2]\u2013[6].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "I.
