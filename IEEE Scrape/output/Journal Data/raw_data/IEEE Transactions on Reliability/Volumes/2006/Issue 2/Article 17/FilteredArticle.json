The semi-parametric PI method relaxes the assumption of an underlying distribution, and is potentially useful in engineering practice, where the underlying information for a failure process is usually not available. PI semi-parametric models initially proposed for clinical studies in medical applications include PWP (Prentice, Williams, and Peterson), AG (Andersen, and Gill), and WLW (Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld). Abundant funding received in medical research has advanced PI models to become well developed, and widely referenced in the biostatistics field. This paper reviews both the available methods for repairable-system reliability assessment, and the published engineering application case studies. An engineering application example that applies PI model to a maintainability process used in US Army M1A2 Arams Main Battle Tank is presented."}, "references": [{"title": "Regression models and lifetables (with discussion)", "context": [{"text": " Cox [1] proposed a proportional hazard (PH) rate function regression model for a non-repairable system.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The Cox [1] PH model deals with a single event, whereas many researchers have expanded the PH model capability to handle recurrent events.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "D.
