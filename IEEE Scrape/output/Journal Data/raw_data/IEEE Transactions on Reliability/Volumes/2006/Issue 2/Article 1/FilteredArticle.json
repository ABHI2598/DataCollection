However this assumption may be unreasonable in a wide scope of cases. Therefore, imprecise reliability modes of a bridge system structure are put forward in this paper, for cases when the above assumptions are violated. The analysis is based on only some partial information about the component lifetime distributions including points of unknown distributions, and probabilities on nested intervals. The effect of the component independence condition on the reliability of systems is studied. The formulas of the unreliability of the bridge system structure are obtained in the explicit form under different conditions."}, "references": [{"title": "Statistical Reasoning With Imprecise Probabilities", "context": [{"text": " To cope with this problem, the theory of imprecise probabilities (also called the theory of lower previsions [1], the theory of interval statistical models [2], or the theory of interval probabilities [3]) is increasingly regarded as a promising tool to assess the reliability of systems.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The foundation of imprecise probability theory can be found in [1], [2].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": " In this paper, we use the notations and definitions introduced by Wally [1].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-3472-7", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "P.
