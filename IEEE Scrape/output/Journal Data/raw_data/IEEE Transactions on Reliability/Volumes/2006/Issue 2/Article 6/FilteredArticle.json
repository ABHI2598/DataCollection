The use in practice of Markov models is, however, hampered by the well-known state space explosion problem. Simulation alleviates the problem. For Markov models of repairable fault-tolerant systems, standard simulation of dependability measures tends to be expensive due to the rarity of the system failure event. Importance sampling can speed up the simulation. This paper develops two importance sampling schemes, called failure transition distance biasing &amp; balanced failure transition distance biasing, which exploit the failure transition distance concept in an attempt to improve the efficiency of two other schemes, failure biasing &amp; and balanced failure biasing. The schemes require the computation of the so-called failure transition distances, and procedures to perform those computations are developed. The presentation is tied to a previously proposed measure-specific simulation method for the steady-state unavailability. An optimization method of the parameters of the importance sampling schemes is also developed. For the simulation of the steady-state unavailability, failure transition distance biasing has (as failure biasing) the bounded relative error property for balanced fault-tolerant systems &amp; balanced failure transition distance biasing has (as balanced failure biasing) the bounded relative error property for both balanced &amp; unbalanced fault-tolerant systems. It is proved that, for balanced fault-tolerant systems, both failure transition distance biasing &amp; balanced failure transition distance biasing can indeed improve the efficiency of failure biasing &amp; balanced failure biasing. In addition, numerical experiments seem to indicate that, for unbalanced fault-tolerant systems, balanced failure transition distance biasing can also improve the efficiency of balanced failure biasing. The application of the failure transition distance-based importance sampling schemes is, however, limited to systems not having too many minimal failure covers, or, at least, not having too many minimal failure covers of small cardinality. A minimal failure cover is a minimal bag of failure bags such that the failure of its components implies the failure of the system; a failure bag is any non-empty bag of component classes which can fail simultaneously."}, "references": [{"title": "The balanced likelihood ratio method for estimating performance\nmeasures of highly reliable systems", "context": [{"text": " It is a heuristic approach in which the modified sampling distributions are chosen using available high-level knowledge about the model at hand, and has been used successfully to estimate dependability measures using both CTMC models [1], [2], [4], [6], [9], [10], [13]\u2013[15], [28], [36] & and non-Markovian stochastic models [17], [19]\u2013[21].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "2"}, {"text": " More recently, robust balanced likelihood ratio techniques have been developed [1], [2] which seem to be more efficient than BFB for fault-tolerant systems with failure rates not much smaller than repair rates & high redundancy degrees.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "2"}, {"text": " Section VI presents numerical results comparing the performances of FB, BFB, FTDB, and BFTDB; analyses the overhead resulting from the computation of failure transition distances in FTDB & BFTDB; and relates FTDB & BFTDB to the importance sampling schemes described in [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "2"}, {"text": "Some of the balanced likelihood ratio techniques developed by Alexopoulos & Shultes [1], [2] exploit the \u201cshortest path to failure concept\u201d in a way similar to the way that FTDB & BFTDB do.", "sec": "sec6d", "part": "2"}, {"text": " Minimum cuts could be considered for systems made up of a set of components whose increasing structure functions are represented by ordinary fault trees including only AND & OR gates, a minimum cut being a minimal cut of minimum cardinality, and the techniques developed in [1], [2] based on the \u201cshortest path to failure\u201d concept could be adapted to that framework, which is a particularization of our framework.", "sec": "sec6d", "part": "2"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "Over the past several years importance sampling in conjunction with regenerative simulation has been presented as a promising method for estimating reliability parameters in highly reliable systems.
