The performance of an infrastructure network and its components degrades over time in real situations. Multi-state reliability modeling that allows a finite number of different states for the performance of the network and its components is more appropriate for the reliability assessment, and provides a more realistic view of the network performance than the traditional binary reliability modeling. Due to the computational complexity of the enumerative methods in evaluating the multi-state reliability, the problem can be reduced to searching lower boundary points, and using them to evaluate reliability. Lower boundary points can be used to compute the exact reliability value and reliability bounds. We present an algorithm to search for lower boundary points. The proposed algorithm has considerable improvement in terms of computational efficiency by significantly reducing the number of iterations to obtain lower reliability bounds.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1638404", "xplore-issue": "34350", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34350", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=An+algorithm+for+lower+reliability+bounds+of+multistate+two-terminal+networks&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2006&author=S.+Satitsatian&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.874922&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=199&endPage=206&volumeNum=55&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "20", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Random variables", "Computer networks", "Stability", "Degradation", "Computational complexity", "Computational efficiency", "Materials reliability", "Industrial engineering", "State-space methods", "Distributed computing"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["iterative methods", "reliability theory", "computational complexity", "search problems"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["iterations", "multistate two-terminal networks", "network reliability bounds", "stability", "infrastructure service quality", "multistate reliability modeling", "binary reliability modeling", "computational complexity", "enumerative method", "search algorithm"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["network reliability", "Lower boundary points", "multistate reliability"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2006", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An algorithm for lower reliability bounds of multistate two-terminal networks", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "55", "accessionNumber": "8942994"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/34350/1638404", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An algorithm for lower reliability bounds of multistate two-terminal networks", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A hybrid algorithm for reliability evaluation of a multi-state system", "displayText": "Xiu-Zhen Xu, Yi-Feng Niu, \"A hybrid algorithm for reliability evaluation of a multi-state system\", <em>Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers</em>, vol. 36, pp. 173, 2013, ISSN 0253-3839.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02533839.2012.730231"}}, {"title": "A dynamic bounding algorithm for approximating multi-state two-terminal reliability", "displayText": "Chin-Chia Jane, Yih-Wenn Laih, \"A dynamic bounding algorithm for approximating multi-state two-terminal reliability\", <em>European Journal of Operational Research</em>, vol. 205, pp. 625, 2010, ISSN 03772217.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2010.01.033"}}, {"title": "An efficient algorithm for evaluating logistics network reliability subject to distribution cost", "displayText": "Yi-Feng Niu, William H.K.
