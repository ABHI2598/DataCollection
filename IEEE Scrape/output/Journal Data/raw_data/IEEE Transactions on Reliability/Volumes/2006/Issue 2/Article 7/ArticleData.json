Several generalizations of the logistic distribution, and certain related models, are proposed in this paper. The corresponding density functions involve an additional parameter, denoted by q, which allows for increased flexibility for modeling purposes; in fact, the larger this parameter is, the lower the mode of the resulting distribution will be. Generalizations of the type-1 and type-2 beta distributions are introduced, along with their logistic-type counterparts; the moments and cumulants of the latter are also derived. Other extensions are discussed including a q-analog of the generalized type-2 beta model, a q-extended generalized logistic distribution, and q-analogs of generalizations of the Dirichlet distribution. As is shown graphically, the proposed univariate distributions can generate a wide array of unimodal or symmetric bimodal curves.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1638406", "xplore-issue": "34350", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34350", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=On+q-logistic+and+related+models&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2006&author=A.M.+Mathai&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.874927&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=237&endPage=244&volumeNum=55&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "7", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Logistics", "Tail", "Statistical distributions", "Physics", "Taylor series"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["life testing", "reliability theory", "statistical distributions"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["skewed distribution", "q-logistic model", "asymmetrical distribution", "reliability assessment", "cumulants", "Dirichlet distribution", "unimodal curve", "symmetric bimodal curve", "life testing model"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["skewed distributions", "Beta distribution", "Dirichlet distribution", "life testing models", "logistic distribution"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2006", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "On q-logistic and related models", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "55", "accessionNumber": "8942996"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/34350/1638406", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "On q-logistic and related models", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "On theq-Weibull Distribution and Its Applications", "displayText": "K.
