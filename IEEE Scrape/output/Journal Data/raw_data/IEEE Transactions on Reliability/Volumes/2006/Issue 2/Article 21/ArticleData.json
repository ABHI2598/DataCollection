To solve the problem, comparison-based search tree structures were used in traditional exact algorithms. These algorithms are not efficient for large problems because significant amounts of data have to be retained and copied in order to generate new partial solutions. Many data may need to be compared for the removal of each redundant partial solution. To overcome these drawbacks, an efficient algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm transforms a spare allocation problem into Boolean functions, and the renowned BDD is used to manipulate them. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is very efficient in terms of speed and memory requirements. It may also be useful for problems which can be modeled as constraint bipartite vertex cover problems.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1638420", "xplore-issue": "34350", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34350", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=An+efficient+algorithm+for+spare+allocation+problems&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2006&author=+Hung-Yau+Lin&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.874942&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=369&endPage=378&volumeNum=55&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "14", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Random access memory", "Read-write memory", "Boolean functions", "Bipartite graph", "Cache memory", "Binary decision diagrams", "Central Processing Unit", "Tree data structures", "Data structures", "DRAM chips"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["redundancy", "storage allocation", "random-access storage", "binary decision diagrams", "Boolean functions"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["binary decision diagram", "spare allocation problems", "redundant RAM", "faulty rows", "faulty columns", "memory cells", "spare rows", "sparse columns", "PAGEB algorithm", "Boolean functions", "BDD", "RRAM"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["vertex cover", "BDD", "bipartite graph", "Boolean functions", "exact algorithm", "memory repair", "RRAM"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2006", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An efficient algorithm for spare allocation problems", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "55", "accessionNumber": "8943010"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/34350/1638420", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "2", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "03 December 2013", "inventors": "Jeong, Woo-Sik; Lee, Kang-Chil; Cho, Jeong-Ho; Lee, Kyoung-Shub; Kang, Il-Kwon; Kang, Sungho; Lee, Joo Hwan", "patentNumber": "8601330", "ipcClassList": "G11C0290000000", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US8601330.pdf", "title": "Device and method for repair analysis", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "714718000, 714005110, 714704000, 702132000, 702183000, 365220000, 365226000", "pocClasses": ["714718000", "714005110", "714704000", "702132000", "702183000", "365220000", "365226000"], "filingDate": "30 December 2010", "id": "08601330", "patentAbstract": "A device for repair analysis includes a selection unit and an analysis unit.
