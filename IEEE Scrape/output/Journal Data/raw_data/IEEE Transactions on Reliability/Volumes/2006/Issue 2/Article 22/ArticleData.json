Thus, in many engineering reliability experiments, measures of degradation or wear toward failure can often be observed over a period of time before failure occurs. Because the degradation values provide additional information beyond that provided by the failure observations, both sets of observations need to be considered when doing inference on the statistical parameters of the product or system lifetime distributions. For highly-reliable modern products, it often takes much more time to obtain lifetime & degradation data under usual use conditions, and this requires one to use accelerated tests. Accelerated tests expose the products to greater environmental stress levels so that we can obtain lifetime & degradation measurements in a more timely fashion. In addition, many products are exposed to several environmental variables in some manufacturing processes, or under some operating conditions. This motivates the need for developing general accelerated test models with several accelerating variables for inference based on both observed failure values, and degradation measurements. In this paper, new accelerated test models are developed based on a generalized cumulative damage approach with a stochastic process characterizing a degradation phenomenon.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1638421", "xplore-issue": "34350", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34350", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Stochastic+degradation+models+with+several+accelerating+variables&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2006&author=C.+Park&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.874937&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=379&endPage=390&volumeNum=55&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "88", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Stochastic processes", "Degradation", "Acceleration", "Life estimation", "Time measurement", "Life testing", "Power system modeling", "Stress measurement", "Accelerometers", "Reliability engineering"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["Brownian motion", "reliability theory", "failure analysis", "life testing", "Gaussian distribution", "Gaussian processes"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["inverse Gaussian distribution", "stochastic process", "degradation phenomenon", "engineering reliability", "failure observation", "wear", "lifetime distribution", "accelerated testing", "products", "environmental stress", "manufacturing process", "generalized cumulative damage approach", "Brownian motion process", "gamma process"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["stochastic process", "Accelerated testing", "Brownian motion process", "cumulative damage", "degradation process", "first passage time", "gamma process", "geometric Brownian motion process", "inverse Gaussian distribution"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2006", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Stochastic degradation models with several accelerating variables", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "55", "accessionNumber": "8943011"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/34350/1638421", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Stochastic degradation models with several accelerating variables", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Optimal design of accelerated degradation tests based on Wiener process models", "displayText": "Heonsang Lim, Bong-Jin Yum, \"Optimal design of accelerated degradation tests based on Wiener process models\", <em>Journal of Applied Statistics</em>, vol. 38, pp. 309, 2011, ISSN 0266-4763.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02664760903406488"}}, {"title": "A survey of the application of gamma processes in maintenance", "displayText": "J.M. van Noortwijk, \"A survey of the application of gamma processes in maintenance\", <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety</em>, vol. 94, pp. 2, 2009, ISSN 09518320.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2007.03.019"}}, {"title": "Real-time reliability evaluation based on independent increment process with random effect", "displayText": "Huibing Hao, Chun Su, Chunping Li, \"Real-time reliability evaluation based on independent increment process with random effect\", <em>Quality Technology & Quantitative Management</em>, pp. 1, 2016, ISSN 1684-3703.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16843703.2016.1226593"}}, {"title": "Optimal Selection of the Most Reliable Design Based on Gamma Degradation Processes", "displayText": "Chih-chun Tsai, Chien-tai Lin, \"Optimal Selection of the Most Reliable Design Based on Gamma Degradation Processes\", <em>Communications in Statistics -
