The semi-parametric PI method relaxes the assumption of an underlying distribution, and is potentially useful in engineering practice, where the underlying information for a failure process is usually not available. PI semi-parametric models initially proposed for clinical studies in medical applications include PWP (Prentice, Williams, and Peterson), AG (Andersen, and Gill), and WLW (Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld). Abundant funding received in medical research has advanced PI models to become well developed, and widely referenced in the biostatistics field.
