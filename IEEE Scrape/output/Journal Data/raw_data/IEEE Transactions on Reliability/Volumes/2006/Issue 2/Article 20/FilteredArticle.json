For a life model of electrical components, the individual aging phenomena of representative electrical components, as well as the general aging mechanisms of insulating materials, are taken into account in this paper. The aging of insulating materials can be estimated by an electrical breakdown occurring in electrical components so that the relationship between lifetime and failure probability of electrical components may be studied using the life model, the probabilistic failure model, and the enlargement law which are reasonably able to investigate the cause & consequence of failure in medium-voltage networks. Thereby, a new approach is developed for the assessment of the actual condition of electrical components in terms of failure time, failure probability, hazard rate, and other related variables of electrical components in medium-voltage networks. These reliability issues will support the decision-making in future deregulation of the electric energy market. Furthermore the model is verified through some electrical components like conductors, cables, transformers, and circuit-breakers with their specific failure statistics. It is demonstrated that the method is able to assess the actual condition of electrical components in medium-voltage networks with reasonable, accurate data."}, "references": [{"title": "Probabilistic methods applied to electric power systems&mdash;Are\nthey worth it?", "context": [{"text": " The specification of what constitutes acceptable levels is a difficult problem which requires a trade-off between quality and costs [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "The authors reflect on and question existing approaches to maintaining and improving the reliability of power systems and review and highlight some alternative ways forward.
