This formalism allows the explicit formalization of functional interaction, the identification of the characteristic values affecting complex system dependability, the quantification of RAMS parameters (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety) for the system's operational architecture, and the validation of the operational architecture in terms of the dependability objectives and constraints required by the functional specifications.
