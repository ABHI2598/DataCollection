Causes of this phenomenon, which has been referred to as \"software aging\", are the accumulation of internal error conditions, and the depletion of operating system resources. A proactive technique called \"software rejuvenation\" has been proposed as a way to counteract software aging. It involves occasionally terminating the software application, cleaning its internal state and/or its environment, and then restarting it. Due to the costs incurred by software rejuvenation, an important question is when to schedule this action. While periodic rejuvenation at constant time intervals is straightforward to implement, it may not yield the best results. The rate at which software ages is usually not constant, but it depends on the time-varying system workload. Software rejuvenation should therefore be planned &amp; initiated in the face of the actual system behavior. This requires the measurement, analysis, and prediction of system resource usage. In this paper, we study the development of resource usage in a web server while subjecting it to an artificial workload. We first collect data on several system resource usage &amp; activity parameters. Non-parametric statistical methods are then applied toward detecting &amp; estimating trends in the data sets. Finally, we fit time series models to the data collected. Unlike the models used previously in the research on software aging, these time series models allow for seasonal patterns, and we show how the exploitation of the seasonal variation can help in adequately predicting the future resource usage. Based on the models employed here, proactive management techniques like software rejuvenation triggered by actual measurements can be built", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1688077", "xplore-issue": "35614", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35614", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Analysis+of+Software+Aging+in+a+Web+Server&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2006&author=M.+Grottke&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.879609&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=411&endPage=420&volumeNum=55&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "118", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Aging", "Web server", "Predictive models", "Software systems", "Degradation", "Operating systems", "Application software", "Cleaning", "Costs", "Time varying systems"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["time series", "file servers", "Internet", "Linux", "software maintenance"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["proactive management techniques", "software aging", "Web server", "operating system resources", "time-varying system", "software rejuvenation", "nonparametric statistical method", "time series model"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["time series analysis", "Apache web server", "Linux", "non-parametric trend analysis", "performance monitoring", "prediction of resource utilization", "software aging", "software rejuvenation"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2006", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analysis of Software Aging in a Web Server", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "55", "accessionNumber": "9091685"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/35614/1688077", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analysis of Software Aging in a Web Server", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A survey of software aging and rejuvenation studies", "displayText": "Domenico Cotroneo, Roberto Natella, Roberto Pietrantuono, Stefano Russo, \"A survey of software aging and rejuvenation studies\", <em>ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems</em>, vol. 10, pp. 1, 2014, ISSN 15504832.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "acmLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2539117"}}, {"title": "Modeling and optimizing periodically inspected software rejuvenation policy based on geometric sequences", "displayText": "Haining Meng, Jianjun Liu, Xinhong Hei, \"Modeling and optimizing periodically inspected software rejuvenation policy based on geometric sequences\", <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety</em>, vol. 133, pp. 184, 2015, ISSN 09518320.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2014.09.007"}}, {"title": "Testing techniques selection based on ODC fault types and software metrics", "displayText": "Domenico Cotroneo, Roberto Pietrantuono, Stefano Russo, \"Testing techniques selection based on ODC fault types and software metrics\", <em>Journal of Systems and Software</em>, pp. , 2013, ISSN 01641212.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2013.02.020"}}, {"title": "Software rejuvenation and resource reservation policies for optimizing server resource availability using cyclic nonhomogeneous Markov chains", "displayText": "V.
