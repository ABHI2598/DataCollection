Based on the (M:N)<sup>n</sup> protection architecture where multiple protection groups (PG) are supported in a single network domain, we propose two novel integer linear programming (ILP) models, namely ILP-I, and ILP-II, aiming to initiate a graceful compromise between the capacity efficiency, and computation complexity without losing the ability of addressing the quality of service (QoS) requirements in each O-VPN. ILP-I considers all the connection requests of each O-VPN in a single formulation, which may suffer from long computation time when the number of connection requests in an O-VPN is large. To trade capacity efficiency with computation complexity, ILP-II is developed such that each O-VPN can be further divided into multiple small PG based on specific grouping policies that satisfy multiple QoS requirements. With ILP-II, it is expected that all the working, and spare capacity of the O-VPN can be allocated with a polynomial time complexity provided that the size of each PG is well constrained. Experimental results show that, in terms of capacity efficiency, a significant improvement can be achieved by ILP-I compared to that by ILP-II at the expense of much more computation time. Although ILP-II is outperformed by ILP-I, it can handle the situation with an arbitrary size of O-VPN. We conclude that the proposed ILP-II model yields a scalable solution for the capacity planning in the survivable optical networks supporting O-VPN based on the (M:N)n protection architecture"}, "references": [{"title": "Analysis of generalized MPLS-based recovery mechanisms (including protection and restoration)", "context": [{"text": " A significant amount of research addresses the topic of achieving network survivability [1]\u2013[4], [6], [10]\u2013[22] for general IP, and WDM networks in which a single domain, and uniform service requirements are assumed.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Similar ideas are taken by the \\$(M:N)^{n}\\$ protection architecture [1], [2] defined in Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) standard signaling protocol, where the network contains \\$n\\$ PG each supporting \\$N\\$ working paths protected by \\$M\\$ protection paths.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The advantages of grouping network demands are numerous, including the improvement of scalability in computation and signaling efforts, the easy manipulation of QoS and survivability metrics, and the relatively less dissemination of link-state in case a distributed control is taken [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " On the other hand, the grouping of network resources has been considered in [1]\u2013[5], [22].", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "D.
