The requirement set by the German Reaktor-Sicherheitskommission (Reactor Safety Commission) demands that the expected number of unfailed rods in the core within one cycle is at least N-1, whereby a confidence level of 0.95 for the verification of this condition is demanded. There is an ongoing debate that this requirement based on an expected value might be a misleading probabilistic safety measure as it does not take into account the accumulated safety probabilities that at least x fuel rods show no failure during one cycle. In this paper we establish a bound for the accumulated safety probability under this safety condition, which implies that with probability greater than 0.98 at least N-3 fuel rods show no failure during one cycle"}, "references": [{"title": "Laws of Small Numbers.
