However, a part could experience several different stress levels, or profiled stress, during its lifetime. One such example is when the part is subject to step-stress accelerated life testing. Studying the reliability estimation & its confidence bounds for a part under varying stresses will generalize the existing estimation methods for accelerated life testing. In this paper, we derive the reliability function of a part under varying stresses based on a Weibull failure time distribution, and cumulative damage model. The reliability confidence bounds, based on a s-normal approximation, are given explicitly, and their limiting properties are discussed. A step-stress accelerated life testing example is used to illustrate these interesting properties, which provides the insights of the limitation of the current test plan, and how to design a better one."}, "references": [{"title": "Bayesian estimation and optimal designs in partially accelerated life testing", "context": [{"text": "The pioneering work for varying stress ALT modeling has been done by DeGroot & Goel [1], and Nelson [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " DeGroot & Goel [1] assumed that under higher stress, the mean product life time would linearly shrink with a constant factor corresponding to the stress level, and proposed a tampered random variable model for simple step stress ALT (SSALT) in the framework of Bayesian decision theory.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nav.3800260204", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "M.
