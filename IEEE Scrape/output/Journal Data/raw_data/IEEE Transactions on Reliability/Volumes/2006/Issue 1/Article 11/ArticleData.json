Dynamic systems exhibit complex behaviors and interactions between their components; where not only the combination of failure events matters, but so does the sequence ordering of the failures. Similar to dynamic fault trees, the CTBN framework defines a set of 'basic' BN constructs that capture well-defined system components' behaviors and interactions. Combining, in a structured way, the various 'basic' Bayesian network constructs enables the user to construct, in a modular and hierarchical fashion, the system model. Within the CTBN framework, one can perform various analyses, including reliability, sensitivity, and uncertainty analyses. All the analyses allow the user to obtain closed-form solutions.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1603897", "xplore-issue": "33703", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33703", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+continuous-time+Bayesian+network+reliability+modeling%2C+and+analysis+framework&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2006&author=H.+Boudali&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.859228&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=86&endPage=97&volumeNum=55&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "64", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Bayesian methods", "Probability density function", "Fault trees", "Random variables", "Performance analysis", "Probability distribution", "Power system reliability", "Power system modeling", "State-space methods", "Explosions"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["sensitivity", "reliability theory", "Bayes methods", "fault trees"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability analysis", "continuous-time Bayesian network", "dynamic systems reliability modeling", "failure sequence ordering", "dynamic fault tree", "hierarchical fashion", "sensitivity", "uncertainty analyses", "closed-form solution"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability modeling and analysis", "Bayesian networks", "dynamic systems"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2006", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A continuous-time Bayesian network reliability modeling, and analysis framework", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "55", "accessionNumber": "8840283"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/33703/1603897", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A continuous-time Bayesian network reliability modeling, and analysis framework", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Approximation algorithm for evaluating time-to-failure distribution of k-out-of-n system with shared standby elements", "displayText": "Gregory Levitin, Suprasad V.
