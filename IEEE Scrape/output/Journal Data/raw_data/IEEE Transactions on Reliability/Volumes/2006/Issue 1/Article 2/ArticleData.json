In this paper, we derive the reliability function of a part under varying stresses based on a Weibull failure time distribution, and cumulative damage model. The reliability confidence bounds, based on a s-normal approximation, are given explicitly, and their limiting properties are discussed. A step-stress accelerated life testing example is used to illustrate these interesting properties, which provides the insights of the limitation of the current test plan, and how to design a better one.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1603888", "xplore-issue": "33703", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33703", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Some+properties+of+confidence+bounds+on+reliability+estimation+for+parts+under+varying+stresses&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2006&author=+Wenbiao+Zhao&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.858091&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=7&endPage=17&volumeNum=55&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "4", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Stress", "Life estimation", "Life testing", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Weibull distribution", "Shape", "Upper bound", "Industrial engineering", "Acceleration", "Lifetime estimation"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["approximation theory", "life testing", "reliability theory", "Weibull distribution", "maximum likelihood estimation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["maximum likelihood estimation", "confidence interval", "reliability estimation", "step-stress accelerated life testing", "Weibull failure time distribution", "cumulative damage model", "s-normal approximation", "current test plan"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["maximum likelihood estimation", "Accelerated life test", "confidence interval", "cumulative damage model"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2006", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Some properties of confidence bounds on reliability estimation for parts under varying stresses", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "55", "accessionNumber": "8840274"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/33703/1603888", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Some properties of confidence bounds on reliability estimation for parts under varying stresses", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Pathological behaviors of fisher confidence bounds for Weibull distribution", "displayText": "Huairui Guo, Haitao Liao, Rong Pan, Alexander Aron, Adamantios Mettas, \"Pathological behaviors of fisher confidence bounds for Weibull distribution\", <em>Computers & Industrial Engineering</em>, vol. 58, pp. 717, 2010, ISSN 03608352.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2010.02.001"}}, {"title": "Bayesian Analysis of Step-Stress Accelerated Life Test with Exponential Distribution", "displayText": "Jinsuk Lee, Rong Pan, \"Bayesian Analysis of Step-Stress Accelerated Life Test with Exponential Distribution\", <em>Quality and Reliability Engineering International</em>, vol. 28, pp. 353, 2012, ISSN 07488017.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qre.1251"}}, {"title": "General linearized model use for High Power Reliability Assessment test results: Conditions, procedure and case study", "displayText": "C.
