The CL cutsets, and the devised bounding method are characterized by the following aspects. 1) CL cutsets include the well known class of consecutive minimal cutsets, introduced by Shanthikumar, as a proper subset. Thus, bounds obtained by our main algorithm yield strict improvements on the basic consecutive cutsets algorithm. We note that extensive empirical studies done to date have shown that the consecutive cutsets method, when empowered by heuristics for choosing suitable cutsets, yields competitive bounds. 2) CL cutsets satisfy the semilattice structure required by Shier's algorithm for computing upper bounds in time polynomial in the number of cuts in a given cutset. Thus, CL cutsets define a new class of efficiently constructible cutsets of polynomial size that benefit from such generalized algorithm. 3) For any fixed value of the parameter k, the devised bounding method can be adapted to satisfy stringent constant-time update constraints, required by the most probable state algorithm of Colbourn &amp; Harms , for obtaining iteratively improvable bounds, without adding significant time overhead to the method. Moreover, the devised bounding algorithm is easy to implement, and the obtained numerical results show more than a 32% improvement over bounds obtained by the basic consecutive cutsets algorithm", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4016403", "xplore-issue": "4016397", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4016397", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Circular+Layout+Cutsets%3A+An+Approach+for+Improving+Consecutive+Cutset+Bounds+for+Network+Reliability&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2006&author=Ehab+S.+Elmallah&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.884595&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=602&endPage=612&volumeNum=55&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "2", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Iterative algorithms", "Polynomials", "Upper bound", "Computer networks", "Dynamic programming", "Wavelength routing", "Wavelength assignment", "Mathematics", "Joining processes"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["telecommunication network topology", "dynamic programming", "heuristic programming", "polynomials", "probability", "telecommunication network reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["network design", "circular layout cutsets", "two-terminal network reliability", "parameterized class", "polynomial time algorithm", "bounding method", "consecutive cutsets algorithm", "heuristics", "competitive bounds", "semilattice structure", "polynomial size", "generalized algorithm", "dynamic programming", "probabilistic graph", "network topology"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["2-terminal network reliability", "Consecutive cuts", "dynamic programming"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2006", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Circular Layout Cutsets: An Approach for Improving Consecutive Cutset Bounds for Network Reliability", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "55", "accessionNumber": "9204028"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4016397/4016403", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Circular Layout Cutsets: An Approach for Improving Consecutive Cutset Bounds for Network Reliability", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Fast computation of bounds for two-terminal network reliability", "displayText": "Stefano Sebastio, Kishor S.
