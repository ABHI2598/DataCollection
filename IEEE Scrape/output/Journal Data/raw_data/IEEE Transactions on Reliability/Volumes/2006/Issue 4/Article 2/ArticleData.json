The black box approach is adequate to characterize the reliability of monolithic, custom, built-to-specification software applications. However, with the widespread use of object oriented systems design &amp; development, the use of component-based software development is on the rise. Software systems are developed in a heterogeneous (multiple teams in different environments) fashion, and hence it may be inappropriate to model the overall failure process of such systems using one of the several software reliability growth models (black box approach). Predicting the reliability of a software system based on its architecture, and the failure behavior of its components, is thus essential. Most of the research efforts in predicting the reliability of a software system based on its architecture have been focused on developing analytical or state-based models. However, the development of state-based models has been mostly ad hoc with little or no effort devoted towards establishing a unifying framework which compares &amp; contrasts these models. Also, to the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to offer an insight into how these models might be applied to real software applications. This paper proposes a unifying framework for state-based models for architecture-based software reliability prediction. The state-based models we consider are the ones in which application architecture is represented either as a discrete time Markov chain (DTMC), or a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). We illustrate the DTMC-based, and CTMC-based models using examples. A detailed discussion of how the parameters of each model may be estimated, and the life cycle phases when the model may be applied is also provided", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4016404", "xplore-issue": "4016397", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4016397", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Analytical+Models+for+Architecture-Based+Software+Reliability+Prediction%3A+A+Unification+Framework&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2006&author=Swapna+S.+Gokhale&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.884587&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=578&endPage=590&volumeNum=55&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "59", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Analytical models", "Software reliability", "Object oriented modeling", "Software systems", "Application software", "Computer architecture", "Predictive models", "Programming", "Life estimation", "Phase estimation"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["software reliability", "formal specification", "Markov processes", "program testing", "software architecture"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["continuous time Markov chain", "analytical model", "software architecture", "software reliability prediction", "unification framework", "black box approach", "object oriented system design", "component-based software development", "state-based model", "discrete time Markov chain"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["unification framework", "Architecture-based analysis", "Markov models", "semi-Markov models", "software reliability"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2006", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analytical Models for Architecture-Based Software Reliability Prediction: A Unification Framework", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "55", "accessionNumber": "9204026"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4016397/4016404", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "1", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "21 April 2015", "inventors": "Machida, Fumio", "patentNumber": "9015675", "ipcClassList": "G06F0094400000, G06F0111000000, G06F0113600000", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US9015675.pdf", "title": "System reliability evaluation device", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "717127000", "pocClasses": ["717127000"], "filingDate": "21 January 2011", "id": "09015675", "patentAbstract": "A system reliability evaluation device 1000 includes a system reliability evaluating part 1100 that, based on connection defect information including the number of times that a defect has occurred in a connection between software components among a plurality of software components operating in connection with each other, evaluates system reliability which is the reliability of an information processing system executing the software.", "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9015675.PN.&OS=PN/9015675", "assignees": ["NEC CORP"], "ipcClasses": ["G06F0094400000", "G06F0111000000", "G06F0113600000"], "appNum": "13640454"}], "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analytical Models for Architecture-Based Software Reliability Prediction: A Unification Framework", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Approach for parameter estimation in Markov model of software reliability for early prediction: a case study", "displayText": "Lalit K.
