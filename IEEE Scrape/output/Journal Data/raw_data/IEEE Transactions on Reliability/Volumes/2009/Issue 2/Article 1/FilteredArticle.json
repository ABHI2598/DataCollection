The resistance behavior of an electrical contact was characterized as a function of temperature. The physics of failure of the contact technology were analysed. A contact resistance model was selected, and its parameters were fitted using the temperature characterization data. The physics of failure model was evaluated with a reliability application (temperature cycle test), and was found to produce estimation errors of &lt; 1 mOmega of during a training period. The temperature and resistance of ten sample contacts were continuously monitored during the temperature cycle test, identifying the maximum temperature and resistances for each cycle. Using the physics of failure model, maximum resistance estimates were generated for each test sample. The residual between the monitored and estimated resistance values was evaluated with the sequential probability ratio test. The method was shown to overcome the issues of traditional threshold-based monitoring approaches, providing accurate resistance estimates, and allowing the detection of abnormal resistance behavior with low false alarm and missed alarm probabilities."}, "references": [{"title": "Maxima-SPRT methodology for health monitoring\nof contact resistance in IC sockets", "context": [{"text": "In enterprise servers, Integrated Circuit (IC) sockets are used to interconnect Land Grid Array (LGA) packages with Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) [1].", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "The evaluation of integrated circuit sockets for quality, reliability, and/or prognostic applications is performed with accelerated tests and stress conditions that are defined by industry standards.
