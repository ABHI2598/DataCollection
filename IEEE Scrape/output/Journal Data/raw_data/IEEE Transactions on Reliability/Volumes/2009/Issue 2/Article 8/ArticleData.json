Currently there are several different ways to calculate the citation rates, each with limitations to be improved. This paper provides a new analysis approach for the ranking and citation of published journals. Because cited half-life is the number of publication years from the current year that account for 50% of the current citations published by a journal in its article references, it can evaluate the age of the majority of cited articles. Through using the cited half-life as the sample time variable, we can seek the normalized value of citations and the citable items. This value can avoid the impacts from different journals or different fields. A more radical improvement is suggested in the impact factor, and relative impact factor, which can measure effectively not only the short-time performance of the journals but also the long-time performance. Based on this, relative R-impact (RRI) is proposed to improve R-impact effectively. </para>", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4967924", "xplore-issue": "5062546", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062546", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Relative+R-Impact+Based+on+Normalization+Method&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2009&author=Jinhui+Pang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2009.2019513&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=324&endPage=327&volumeNum=58&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "0", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Intersymbol interference", "Citation analysis", "Rail to rail inputs", "Information resources", "Technology management", "Databases", "Frequency measurement", "Educational institutions"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["relative R-impact", "Cited half-life", "impact factor"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Relative R-Impact Based on Normalization Method", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": ""}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/5062546/4967924", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Relative R-Impact Based on Normalization Method", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {}, "mlTime": "PT0.029399S", "title": "Relative R-Impact Based on Normalization Method", "lastupdate": "2016-11-12T02:00:49", "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0"}, "references": [{"id": "ref1", "refType": "biblio", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.178.4060.471"}, "context": [{"sec": "sec1", "part": "1", "text": "Impact factor, which was first introduced from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) by Garfield [1], is the main subject of many research databases."}], "title": "Citation analysis as a tool\nin journal evaluation", "order": "1", "text": "E.
