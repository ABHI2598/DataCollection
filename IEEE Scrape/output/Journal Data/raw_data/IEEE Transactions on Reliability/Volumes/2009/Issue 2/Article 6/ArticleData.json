However, support for PHM is predicated on the articulation of clear business cases that quantify the expected cost and benefits of its implementation. The realization of PHM requires implementation at different levels of scale, and complexity. The maturity, robustness, and applicability of the underlying predictive algorithms impact the overall efficacy of PHM within an enterprise. The utility of PHM to inform decision-makers within tight scheduling constraints, and under different operational profiles likewise affects the cost avoidance that can be realized. This paper discusses the calculation of Return on Investment (ROI) for PHM activities, and presents a study conducted using a stochastic discrete event simulation model to determine the potential ROI offered by electronics PHM. The case study of a multifunctional display in a Boeing 737 compares the life cycle costs of a system employing unscheduled maintenance to the same system using a precursor to failure PHM approach.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4967922", "xplore-issue": "5062546", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062546", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+Methodology+for+Determining+the+Return+on+Investment+Associated+With+Prognostics+and+Health+Management&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2009&author=Kiri+Feldman&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2009.2020133&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=305&endPage=316&volumeNum=58&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "41", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Investments", "Prognostics and health management", "Costs", "Decision making", "Feedback", "Product design", "Robustness", "Prediction algorithms", "Stochastic processes", "Discrete event simulation"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["product design", "aircraft", "aircraft maintenance", "decision making", "failure analysis", "investment", "life cycle costing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["life cycle costs", "prognostics", "health management", "maintenance decision making", "product design", "scheduling constraints", "return-on-investment", "cost modeling", "Boeing 737"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["return on investment", "Avionics", "cost modeling", "electronics prognostics and health management", "prognostics and health management"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Methodology for Determining the Return on Investment Associated With Prognostics and Health Management", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "10712957"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/5062546/4967922", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Methodology for Determining the Return on Investment Associated With Prognostics and Health Management", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Perspectives on the commercial development of landing gear health monitoring systems", "displayText": "Paul Phillips, Dominic Diston, Andrew Starr, \"Perspectives on the commercial development of landing gear health monitoring systems\", <em>Transportation Research Part C Emerging Technologies</em>, pp. , 2011, ISSN 0968090X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2011.03.005"}}, {"title": "Challenges for Costs and Benefits Evaluation of IVHM Systems", "displayText": "Joao Pedro Pinheiro Malere, Luis Gustavo dos Santos, \"Challenges for Costs and Benefits Evaluation of IVHM Systems\", <em>SAE International Journal of Aerospace</em>, vol. 6, pp. 484, 2013, ISSN 1946-3901.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4271/2013-01-2183"}}, {"title": "Optimal prognostic distance to minimize total maintenance cost: The case of the airline industry", "displayText": "R.
