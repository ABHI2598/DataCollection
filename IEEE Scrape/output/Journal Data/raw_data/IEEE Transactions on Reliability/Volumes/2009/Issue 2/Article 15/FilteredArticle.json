If there exists no shock, the successive operating time of the system after repair will form a geometric process. Assume that the shocks will arrive according to a Poisson process. When the interarrival time of two successive shocks is smaller than a specified threshold, the system fails, and the latter shock is called a deadly shock. The successive threshold values are monotone geometric. The system will fail at the end of its operating time, or the arrival of a deadly shock, whichever occurs first. The consecutive repair time after failure will constitute a geometric process. A replacement policy <i>N</i> is adopted by which the system will be replaced by a new, identical one at the time following the <i>N</i> th failure. Then, for the deteriorating system, and the improving system, an optimal policy <i>N*</i> for minimizing the long-run average cost per unit time is determined analytically."}, "references": [{"title": "Generalized shock models based on a cluster\npoint process", "context": [{"text": " [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "We review the principal progress of shock models during the last three decades.
