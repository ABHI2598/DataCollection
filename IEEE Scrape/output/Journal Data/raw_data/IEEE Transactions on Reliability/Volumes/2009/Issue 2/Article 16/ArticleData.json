The imperfect PM model proposed in this study incorporates improvement factors vis-a-vis the hazard-rate function, and effective age. As failures occur, the system experiences one of the two types of failure: type-I failure (minor), and type-II failure (catastrophic). Type-I failures are rectified with minimal repair. In a PM period, the system is preventively maintained following the occurrence of a type-II failure, or at age T, whichever takes place first. At the N th PM, the system is replaced. An approach that generalizes the existing studies on the periodic PM policy is proposed. Taking age-dependent failure type into consideration, the objective consists of determining the optimal PM &amp; replacement schedule that minimize the expected cost per unit of time, over an infinite horizon.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4967910", "xplore-issue": "5062546", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062546", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=An+Extended+Periodic+Imperfect+Preventive+Maintenance+Model+With+Age-Dependent+Failure+Type&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2009&author=Shey-Huei+Sheu&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2009.2020103&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=397&endPage=405&volumeNum=58&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "34", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Preventive maintenance", "Cost function", "Hazards", "Job shop scheduling", "Operating systems", "Infinite horizon", "Distribution functions", "Probability density function", "Technology management"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["preventive maintenance", "failure analysis", "optimisation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["maintenance optimization", "extended periodic imperfect preventive maintenance model", "age-dependent failure type system", "hazard-rate function", "repair", "replacement policy"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["replacement policy", "Improvement factor", "maintenance optimization", "minimal repair", "preventive maintenance"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An Extended Periodic Imperfect Preventive Maintenance Model With Age-Dependent Failure Type", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "10712954"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/5062546/4967910", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An Extended Periodic Imperfect Preventive Maintenance Model With Age-Dependent Failure Type", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Semi-parametric estimation of Brown\u2013Proschan preventive maintenance effects and intrinsic wear-out", "displayText": "L.
