The imperfect PM model proposed in this study incorporates improvement factors vis-a-vis the hazard-rate function, and effective age. As failures occur, the system experiences one of the two types of failure: type-I failure (minor), and type-II failure (catastrophic). Type-I failures are rectified with minimal repair. In a PM period, the system is preventively maintained following the occurrence of a type-II failure, or at age T, whichever takes place first. At the N th PM, the system is replaced. An approach that generalizes the existing studies on the periodic PM policy is proposed. Taking age-dependent failure type into consideration, the objective consists of determining the optimal PM &amp; replacement schedule that minimize the expected cost per unit of time, over an infinite horizon."}, "references": [{"title": "Optimum preventive maintenance\npolicies", "context": [{"text": " Perfect PM (or simple replacement) models assume that a system is \u201cas good as new\u201d immediately after PM, whereas minimal repair models assume that the system hazard-rate function is not disturbed by any minimal repair, i.e., the system is \u201cas bad as old\u201d after minimal repair [1] [9] [29].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "This is the case considered by [1] which is the classical periodic replacement policy with minimal repair at failure.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}, {"text": " In this case, if we make \\$N=1\\$ \\$c_{B}=0\\$ \\$p_{1}(t)=0\\$ and \\$h_{1}(t)=E_{C_{1}(t)}[g_{1}(C_{1}(t),c_{1,k}(t)]=c_{M}\\$ for \\$k=0,1,2,\\cdots\\$ in (7) then as obtained by [1].", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}, {"text": "This is the classical age-replacement policy considered by [1] where the system is replaced at the time of failure, or at age \\$T\\$ whichever comes first.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}, {"text": " In this case, if we make \\$N=1\\$ \\$p_{1}(t)=1\\$ and \\$h_{1}(t)=E_{C_{1}(t)}[g_{1}(C_{1}(t),c_{1,k}(t)]=0\\$ for \\$k=1,2,\\cdots\\$ in (7) then as obtained by [1].", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.8.1.90", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "R.
