When component failure times are correlated, independence assumptions are not valid, and thus, many common reliability modeling practices are inappropriate. If component reliability is influenced by environmental exposure, then the components within a system are likely to...", "documentLink": "/document/744121"}, "context": [{"sec": "sec2c2", "part": "1", "text": " The vector \\$z(t)\\$ is then introduced in the expression of \\$R(t)\\$ [20] or \\$\\lambda(t)\\$ [21] where \\$R(t)\\$ is the reliability function."}], "title": "System reliability modeling\nconsidering the dependence of componentenvironmental influences", "order": "20", "text": "D.
