The resistance behavior of an electrical contact was characterized as a function of temperature. The physics of failure of the contact technology were analysed. A contact resistance model was selected, and its parameters were fitted using the temperature characterization data. The physics of failure model was evaluated with a reliability application (temperature cycle test), and was found to produce estimation errors of &lt; 1 mOmega of during a training period. The temperature and resistance of ten sample contacts were continuously monitored during the temperature cycle test, identifying the maximum temperature and resistances for each cycle. Using the physics of failure model, maximum resistance estimates were generated for each test sample. The residual between the monitored and estimated resistance values was evaluated with the sequential probability ratio test. The method was shown to overcome the issues of traditional threshold-based monitoring approaches, providing accurate resistance estimates, and allowing the detection of abnormal resistance behavior with low false alarm and missed alarm probabilities.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "5061481", "xplore-issue": "5062546", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062546", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Modeling+of+IC+Socket+Contact+Resistance+for+Reliability+and+Health+Monitoring+Applications&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2009&author=Leoncio+D.+Lopez&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2009.2020122&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=264&endPage=270&volumeNum=58&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "1", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Integrated circuit modeling", "Application specific integrated circuits", "Sockets", "Contact resistance", "Condition monitoring", "Temperature", "Physics", "Sequential analysis", "Electronic equipment testing", "Electric resistance"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability", "contact resistance", "electric connectors", "electrical contacts", "failure analysis", "integrated circuit interconnections"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["sequential probability ratio test", "IC socket", "contact resistance", "health monitoring", "electrical interconnects", "reliability", "electrical contact", "failure model"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["physics of failure", "Accelerated test", "contact resistance", "elastomer socket", "health monitoring"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Modeling of IC Socket Contact Resistance for Reliability and Health Monitoring Applications", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "10712958"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/5062546/5061481", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Modeling of IC Socket Contact Resistance for Reliability and Health Monitoring Applications", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"title": "A Practical, Innovative Method for Electro-Static Discharge Data Analysis", "displayText": "Wei-Ting Kary Chien, Siyuan Frank Yang, \"A Practical Innovative Method for Electro-Static Discharge Data Analysis\", <em>Reliability IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 59, pp. 440-446, 2010, ISSN 0018-9529.", "order": "1", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5475448", "pdfSize": "322KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5475448"}}]}, "mlTime": "PT0.054565S", "title": "Modeling of IC Socket Contact Resistance for Reliability and Health Monitoring Applications", "lastupdate": "2016-11-12T02:01:22", "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0"}, "references": [{"id": "ref1", "refType": "biblio", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711465", "pdfSize": "2716KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "The evaluation of integrated circuit sockets for quality, reliability, and/or prognostic applications is performed with accelerated tests and stress conditions that are defined by industry standards.
