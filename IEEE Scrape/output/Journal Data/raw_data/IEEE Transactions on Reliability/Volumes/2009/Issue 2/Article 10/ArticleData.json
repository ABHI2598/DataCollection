We propose the Recursive Truncation Algorithm (RTA), a bounding approximation algorithm, to estimate the all-terminal reliability of a given network with a pre-specified accuracy. RTA scans all minimal cutsets of the graph representing the network, and finds the weak cutsets of the graph by comparing failure probabilities of cutsets to an adaptive threshold which depends on the approximation accuracy. We calculate the unreliability of the network versus the probabilities of occurrence of failure in the weak cutsets, and the probabilities of co-occurrence of failure in several weak cutsets, simultaneously. In addition to the all-terminal reliability, the RTA computes an upper, and a lower bound for the estimated reliability. We demonstrate that the estimated all-terminal reliability of a given network is within a pre-specified accuracy, and is more precise than those obtained by existing methods.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4967925", "xplore-issue": "5062546", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062546", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=All-Terminal+Network+Reliability+Using+Recursive+Truncation+Algorithm&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2009&author=Ahmad+R.+Sharafat&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2009.2020120&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=338&endPage=347&volumeNum=58&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "17", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Power system reliability", "Approximation algorithms", "Probability", "Telecommunication network reliability", "Estimation error", "Approximation methods", "Computational complexity", "Recursive estimation", "Convergence", "Computer network reliability"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["telecommunication terminals", "approximation theory", "communication complexity", "graph theory", "probability", "telecommunication network reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["probability", "all-terminal network reliability estimation", "recursive truncation algorithm", "computational complexity", "bounding approximation algorithm", "graph representation"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["weak cutsets", "Minimal cutset", "network reliability", "truncation approximation"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "All-Terminal Network Reliability Using Recursive Truncation Algorithm", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "10712951"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/5062546/4967925", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "All-Terminal Network Reliability Using Recursive Truncation Algorithm", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Efficient Optimization of Reliable Two-Node Connected Networks: A Biobjective Approach", "displayText": "Abdullah Konak, Alice E.
