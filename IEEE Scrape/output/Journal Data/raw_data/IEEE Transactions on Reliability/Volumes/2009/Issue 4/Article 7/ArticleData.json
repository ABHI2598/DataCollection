While the cost and straightforward application of random testing are appealing, these benefits must be evaluated against the reduced effectiveness due to the generality of the approach. Recently, a number of novel techniques, coined Adaptive Random Testing, have sought to increase the effectiveness of random testing by attempting to maximize the testing coverage of the input domain. This paper presents the novel application of an evolutionary search algorithm to this problem. The results of an extensive simulation study are presented in which the evolutionary approach is compared against the Fixed Size Candidate Set (FSCS), Restricted Random Testing (RRT), quasi-random testing using the Sobol sequence (Sobol), and random testing (RT) methods. The evolutionary approach was found to be superior to FSCS, RRT, Sobol, and RT amongst block patterns, the arena in which FSCS, and RRT have demonstrated the most appreciable gains in testing effectiveness. The results among fault patterns with increased complexity were shown to be similar to those of FSCS, and RRT; and showed a modest improvement over Sobol, and RT. A comparison of the asymptotic and empirical runtimes of the evolutionary search algorithm, and the other testing approaches, was also considered, providing further evidence that the application of an evolutionary search algorithm is feasible, and within the same order of time complexity as the other adaptive random testing approaches.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "5338642", "xplore-issue": "5338641", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338641", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+Novel+Evolutionary+Approach+for+Adaptive+Random+Testing&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2009&author=Andrew+F.+Tappenden&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2009.2034288&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=619&endPage=633&volumeNum=58&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "25", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Biological cells", "Automatic testing", "Software testing", "Power capacitors", "Costs", "Genetic algorithms", "Analysis of variance", "Subspace constraints", "Runtime", "Application software"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["program testing", "evolutionary computation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["software testing", "adaptive random testing", "fixed size candidate set", "restricted random testing", "Sobol sequence", "testing coverage", "evolutionary search algorithm"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["test strategies", "Adaptive random testing", "automated testing", "evolutionary computing and genetic algorithms", "random testing", "software testing", "test generation"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Novel Evolutionary Approach for Adaptive Random Testing", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "11000744"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/5338641/5338642", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Novel Evolutionary Approach for Adaptive Random Testing", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Adaptive random testing through test profiles", "displayText": "Huai Liu, Xiaodong Xie, Jing Yang, Yansheng Lu, Tsong Yueh Chen, \"Adaptive random testing through test profiles\", <em>Software Practice and Experience</em>, pp. n/a, 2011, ISSN 1097024X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/spe.1067"}}, {"title": "A revisit of three studies related to random testing", "displayText": "Tsong Yueh Chen, Fei-Ching Kuo, Dave Towey, Zhi Quan Zhou, \"A revisit of three studies related to random testing\", <em>Science China Information Sciences</em>, vol. 58, pp. 1, 2015, ISSN 1674-733X.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-015-5314-x"}}, {"title": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "displayText": "Ireneusz Mrozek, Vyacheslav Yarmolik, <em>Lecture Notes in Computer Science</em>, vol. 9842, pp. 429, 2016, ISSN 0302-9743, ISBN 978-3-319-45377-4.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45378-1_38"}}, {"title": "An orchestrated survey of methodologies for automated software test case generation", "displayText": "Saswat Anand, Edmund K.
