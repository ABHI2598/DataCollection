The component is placed in a socket, and the component and socket together comprise the system. The <i>s</i>-population of components consists of two sub-populations with different failure characteristics. By supposing that a component may be in a defective but operating state, so that there exists a delay time between defect arrival and component failure, we consider a novel maintenance policy that is a hybrid of inspection and replacement policies. There are similarities in this approach with the concept of ldquoburn-inrdquo maintenance. The policies are investigated in the context of traction motor bearing failures. Under certain circumstances, particularly when the mixture parameter is large, and the distribution of lifetimes for the two component types are well separated, the hybrid policy has significant cost savings over the standard age-based replacement policy, and over the pure inspection policy. In addition to the cost metric, the mean time between operational failures of the system under the hybrid policy can be used to guide decision-making. This maintenance policy metric is calculated using simulation, and using an approximation which assumes that operational failures occur according to a Poisson process with a rate that can be calculated in a straightforward way. The simulation results show good agreement with the approximation.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "5196696", "xplore-issue": "5338641", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338641", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=An+Age-Based+Inspection+and+Replacement+Policy+for+Heterogeneous+Components&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2009&author=Philip+A.+Scarf&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2009.2026796&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=641&endPage=648&volumeNum=58&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "16", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Inspection", "Cost function", "Delay effects", "Sockets", "Probability density function", "Distribution functions", "Traction motors", "Decision making", "Statistics", "Geology"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability", "inspection", "maintenance engineering"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["inspection maintenance", "age-based inspection", "replacement policy", "heterogeneous components", "hybrid maintenance policy", "delay time"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["inspection maintenance", "Age based replacement", "delay time"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An Age-Based Inspection and Replacement Policy for Heterogeneous Components", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "11000737"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/5338641/5196696", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An Age-Based Inspection and Replacement Policy for Heterogeneous Components", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A two-phase inspection policy with imperfect testing", "displayText": "M.D. Berrade, \"A two-phase inspection policy with imperfect testing\", <em>Applied Mathematical Modelling</em>, vol. 36, pp. 108, 2012, ISSN 0307904X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2011.05.035"}}, {"title": "An ideal way of obtaining an optimal inspection permutation for a system with components connected in series", "displayText": "Honest Walter Chipoyera, \"An ideal way of obtaining an optimal inspection permutation for a system with components connected in series\", <em>Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry</em>, pp. , 2016, ISSN 15241904.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asmb.2204"}}, {"title": "Maintenance scheduling of a protection system subject to imperfect inspection and replacement", "displayText": "M.D. Berrade, Cristiano A.V.
