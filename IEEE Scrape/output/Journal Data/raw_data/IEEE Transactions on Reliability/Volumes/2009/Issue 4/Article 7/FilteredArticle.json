While the cost and straightforward application of random testing are appealing, these benefits must be evaluated against the reduced effectiveness due to the generality of the approach. Recently, a number of novel techniques, coined Adaptive Random Testing, have sought to increase the effectiveness of random testing by attempting to maximize the testing coverage of the input domain. This paper presents the novel application of an evolutionary search algorithm to this problem. The results of an extensive simulation study are presented in which the evolutionary approach is compared against the Fixed Size Candidate Set (FSCS), Restricted Random Testing (RRT), quasi-random testing using the Sobol sequence (Sobol), and random testing (RT) methods. The evolutionary approach was found to be superior to FSCS, RRT, Sobol, and RT amongst block patterns, the arena in which FSCS, and RRT have demonstrated the most appreciable gains in testing effectiveness. The results among fault patterns with increased complexity were shown to be similar to those of FSCS, and RRT; and showed a modest improvement over Sobol, and RT. A comparison of the asymptotic and empirical runtimes of the evolutionary search algorithm, and the other testing approaches, was also considered, providing further evidence that the application of an evolutionary search algorithm is feasible, and within the same order of time complexity as the other adaptive random testing approaches."}, "references": [{"title": "On the statistical properties\nof testing effectiveness measures", "context": [{"text": "The (a) block, (b) strip, and (c) point failure patterns associated with the f-measure [1].", "sec": "sec4b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " [1] was chosen due to its widespread use within the field [1], [5], [8]\u2013[14], [18], [19], [21], [22], [37], and specific applicability to software testing.", "sec": "sec4c", "part": "1"}, {"text": " [1], whereby two points are selected: one on a horizontal boundary, and the other on the vertical boundary.", "sec": "sec4c", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Despite these limitations, the implementation of the failure patterns is in-line with those used in the literature, providing the ability to clearly evaluate the study results within the context of current ART research [1], [11], [19], [21], [37].", "sec": "sec4c", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The point pattern as defined [1] requires that all points exist completely within the input boundary.", "sec": "sec5e", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2005.05.029", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "T.
