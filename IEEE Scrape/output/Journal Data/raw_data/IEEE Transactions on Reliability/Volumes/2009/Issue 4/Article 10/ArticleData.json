Strategic, tactical, and operational level decisions involving warranty cost very often use warranty spending forecasts that are developed using statistical methods. Existing literature provides warranty forecasting approaches involving variables such as mileage accumulation rate, failure rate, repeat repair rate, and cost per repair. However, there are several key failure modes that are known to be influenced by seasonality. For example, `engine slow to start' conditions drive a higher claim rate in colder months than in warmer months. Accommodation of such failure modes influenced by seasonality has not been considered in the warranty cost modeling literature. This paper presents a flexible approach for developing a monthly warranty spend forecasting model that incorporates calendar month seasonality, business days per month for authorized service centers, and sales ramp-up in addition to the earlier mentioned variables. On one hand, the model allows development of warranty spend forecasts for entire warranty coverage to support strategic level decisions; on the other hand, forecasts for monthly warranty spend help support tactical and operational level decisions. The workability of the proposed methodology is illustrated using an application example.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4967918", "xplore-issue": "5338641", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338641", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Warranty+Spend+Forecasting+for+Subsystem+Failures+Influenced+by+Calendar+Month+Seasonality&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2009&author=Bharatendra+K.+Rai&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2009.2019673&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=649&endPage=657&volumeNum=58&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "4", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Warranties", "Calendars", "Costs", "Predictive models", "Financial management", "Decision making", "Statistical analysis", "Engines", "Marketing and sales", "Workability"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["statistical analysis", "automobile industry", "costing", "engines", "forecasting theory", "maintenance engineering"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["engines", "warranty cost", "subsystem failures", "calendar month seasonality", "spend forecasting model", "strategic decision making", "statistical methods", "failure rate", "service centers", "repair"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["warranty forecasting", "Automobile warranty", "hazard rate", "sales ramp-up", "seasonality effect"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Warranty Spend Forecasting for Subsystem Failures Influenced by Calendar Month Seasonality", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "11000735"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/5338641/4967918", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Warranty Spend Forecasting for Subsystem Failures Influenced by Calendar Month Seasonality", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A review on coarse warranty data and analysis", "displayText": "Shaomin Wu, \"A review on coarse warranty data and analysis\", <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety</em>, vol. 114, pp. 1, 2013, ISSN 09518320.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2012.12.021"}}, {"title": "Support vector regression for warranty claim forecasting", "displayText": "Shaomin Wu, Artur Akbarov, \"Support vector regression for warranty claim forecasting\", <em>European Journal of Operational Research</em>, vol. 213, pp. 196, 2011, ISSN 03772217.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2011.03.009"}}, {"title": "Warranty Data Analysis: A Review : Quality and Reliability Engineering International", "displayText": "Shaomin Wu, \"Warranty Data Analysis: A Review : Quality and Reliability Engineering International\", <em>Quality and Reliability Engineering International</em>, pp. n/a, 2012, ISSN 10991638.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qre.1282"}}], "ieee": [{"title": "Reliability vs. Total Quality Cost &#x2014; Part selection criteria based on field data, combined optimal customer and business solution", "displayText": "S.
