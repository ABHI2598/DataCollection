This test method is simple to apply; however, it requires excessive test time and/or a large sample size, and thus is often unaffordable. For some products, a failure is defined in terms of a performance characteristic exceeding a specified threshold. For these products, it is possible to measure the performance characteristic at different times during testing. The measurement data can be employed to predict whether or not a test unit will fail by the end of the test. When there are sufficient data to make such a prediction with a high degree of confidence, the test of the unit can be terminated. As a result, the test time is reduced. This paper develops a method for degradation bogey testing to reduce test time. In particular, the paper describes degradation modeling, and the calculation of the conditional failure probability of a test unit. Then we develop the optimum test plans, which choose the sample size, and the expected test time, by minimizing the total test cost, and simultaneously satisfying the constraints on the type II error and available sample size. Sensitivity analysis shows that the optimum test plans are robust against the preestimates of model parameters. The paper also presents decision rules for terminating the test of a unit. The proposed method is illustrated with an example. The application shows that the method is effective in reducing test time.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "5325794", "xplore-issue": "5338641", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338641", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Reliability+Demonstration+Through+Degradation+Bogey+Testing&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2009&author=Guangbin+Yang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2009.2033733&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=604&endPage=610&volumeNum=58&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "16", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Degradation", "Life testing", "Costs", "Time measurement", "Production", "Shape measurement", "Sensitivity analysis", "Robustness", "Power measurement", "Electric variables measurement"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability", "production management", "production testing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["sensitivity analysis", "reliability demonstration", "degradation", "Bogey testing", "zero-failure testing"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["sensitivity analysis", "Bogey test", "degradation", "optimum plan", "reliability demonstration"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability Demonstration Through Degradation Bogey Testing", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "11000745"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/5338641/5325794", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability Demonstration Through Degradation Bogey Testing", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "TEST TIME REDUCTION THROUGH OPTIMAL DEGRADATION TESTING", "displayText": "GUANGBIN YANG, \"TEST TIME REDUCTION THROUGH OPTIMAL DEGRADATION TESTING\", <em>International Journal of Reliability Quality and Safety Engineering</em>, vol. 17, pp. 495, 2010, ISSN 0218-5393.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218539310003901"}}, {"title": "Accelerated reliability demonstration under competing failure modes", "displayText": "Wei Luo, Chun-hua Zhang, Xun Chen, Yuan-yuan Tan, \"Accelerated reliability demonstration under competing failure modes\", <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety</em>, vol. 136, pp. 75, 2015, ISSN 09518320.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2014.11.014"}}, {"title": "Bayesian zero-failure reliability modeling and assessment method for multiple numerical control (NC) machine tools", "displayText": "Ying-nan Kan, Zhao-jun Yang, Guo-fa Li, Jia-long He, Yan-kun Wang, Hong-zhou Li, \"Bayesian zero-failure reliability modeling and assessment method for multiple numerical control (NC) machine tools\", <em>Journal of Central South University</em>, vol. 23, pp. 2858, 2016, ISSN 2095-2899.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11771-016-3349-9"}}, {"title": "Design of optimum component test plans in the demonstration of diverse system performance measures", "displayText": "Emre Yamangil, \u0130.
