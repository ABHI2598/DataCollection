The self-organized nature of ad hoc networks makes the network utility-based approach an efficient way to allocate limited resources.

To efficiently address the routing problem in ad hoc networks, we integrate the cost and stability into a network utility metric, and adopt the metric to evaluate the routing optimality in a unified, opportunistic routing model. Based on this model, an efficient algorithm is designed, both centralized and distributed implementations are presented, and extensive simulations on NS-2 are conducted to verify our results."}, "references": [{"title": "ExOR: Opportunistic multi-hop\nrouting for wireless networks", "context": [{"text": " Existing routing protocols [1]\u2013\n\n[4] address the problems either separately, or simply combine them without considering their correlation.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Various existing routing protocols [1], [7] pursue the minimum hop count, or minimum cost as their optimization goal.", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Opportunistic routing (OR) [1], [10], [11] is mainly proposed to address the unreliable communication in multi-hop wireless networks by utilizing the broadcast advantages of wireless communication.", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Other OR protocols [1], [14], [15] select any node with smaller cost to the destination as a relay.", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Most existing works [1], [21] prioritized the relays based on the expected number of transmissions along the best path alone.", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The opportunistic routing scheme (ExOR) [1] regulates that each node selects a relay set (the set of relay nodes) to forward packets.", "sec": "sec3c", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Similar to ExOR [1], [5], in which a node's distance to the destination is calculated in terms of hop count or ETX [2], we adopt expected utility as the metric to evaluate the distance.", "sec": "sec4a", "part": "1"}, {"text": "In previous opportunistic routing models [1], [11], [14], the optimal solution is related to a total order among intermediate nodes according to metrics such as expected transmission count or geometric distance.", "sec": "sec4b", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "S.

The self-organized nature of ad hoc networks makes the social welfare based approach an efficient way to allocate the limited resources. However, the effect of instability of wireless links has not been adequately addressed in the literature. To efficiently address the routing problem in ad hoc networks, we introduce a new metric, maximum expected social welfare, and integrate the co...", "documentLink": "/document/1690622", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1690622", "pdfSize": "194KB"}, "id": "ref26", "text": "M.

In multi-hop ad hoc networks, each node may be responsible for forwarding data packets for others. Thus, some nodes may consume more energy than others, and consequently die earlier This leads to unbalanced usage of the power among the nodes, network partition, and the decrease in network lifetime. The UBR algorithm we develop takes into account not only the status of each intermediate node but also th...", "documentLink": "/document/1392217", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1392217", "pdfSize": "400KB"}, "id": "ref27", "text": "C.
