Thus, reliability is a natural characteristic of a system's health, and can be used for condition monitoring &amp; predictive maintenance. This paper introduces a new real-time reliability prediction method for dynamic systems which incorporates an on-line fault prediction algorithm. The factors that may reduce a system's reliability are modeled as an additive fault input to the system, and the fault is assumed to be varying linearly with time, approximately. The time-varying fault is roughly estimated based on a modified particle filtering algorithm at first. Then, as a time series, the fault estimate sequence is smoothed, and predicted by an exponential smoothing method. Mathematical analysis shows that the effects of the system, and measurement noises on the fault estimates are greatly reduced by exponential smoothing, which indicates that the comparatively high accuracy of the fault estimates &amp; predictions is guaranteed. Based on the particle filtering &amp; fault prediction results, the whole system's predictive reliability is computed through a Monte Carlo simulation strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed real-time reliability prediction method is validated by a computer simulation of a three-vessel water tank system.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "5191081", "xplore-issue": "5230375", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230375", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+New+Real-Time+Reliability+Prediction+Method+for+Dynamic+Systems+Based+on+On-Line+Fault+Prediction&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2009&author=Zhengguo+Xu&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2009.2026785&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=523&endPage=538&volumeNum=58&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "37", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Real time systems", "Prediction methods", "Smoothing methods", "Pediatrics", "Degradation", "Condition monitoring", "Predictive maintenance", "Prediction algorithms", "Reliability", "Linear approximation"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["water storage", "Monte Carlo methods", "particle filtering (numerical methods)", "prediction theory", "reliability theory", "smoothing methods", "tanks (containers)", "time series", "time-varying systems"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["three-vessel water tank system", "real-time reliability prediction method", "dynamic system", "on-line fault prediction", "infant mortality period", "component degradation", "external attack", "condition monitoring", "predictive maintenance", "additive fault input", "time-varying fault", "particle filtering algorithm", "time series", "exponential smoothing method", "mathematical analysis", "Monte Carlo simulation strategy"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["real-time reliability prediction", "Dynamic systems", "exponential smoothing", "fault prediction", "particle filtering", "predictive maintenance"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A New Real-Time Reliability Prediction Method for Dynamic Systems Based on On-Line Fault Prediction", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "10847428"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/5230375/5191081", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A New Real-Time Reliability Prediction Method for Dynamic Systems Based on On-Line Fault Prediction", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Remaining Useful Life Prediction Based on the Mixed Effects Model with Mixture Prior Distribution", "displayText": "Raed Kontar, Junbo Son, Shiyu Zhou, Chaitanya Sankavaram, Yilu Zhang, Xinyu Du, \"Remaining Useful Life Prediction Based on the Mixed Effects Model with Mixture Prior Distribution\", <em>IISE Transactions</em>, pp. 0, 2016, ISSN 2472-5854.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24725854.2016.1263771"}}, {"title": "A modified profust-performance-reliability algorithm and its application to dynamic systems", "displayText": "Zhiyao Zhao, Quan Quan, Kai-Yuan Cai, \"A modified profust-performance-reliability algorithm and its application to dynamic systems\", <em>Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems</em>, pp. 1, 2017, ISSN 10641246.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JIFS-152544"}}, {"title": "Real-time reliability evaluation based on independent increment process with random effect", "displayText": "Huibing Hao, Chun Su, Chunping Li, \"Real-time reliability evaluation based on independent increment process with random effect\", <em>Quality Technology & Quantitative Management</em>, pp. 1, 2016, ISSN 1684-3703.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16843703.2016.1226593"}}, {"title": "State-Based Prognostics with State Duration Information", "displayText": "O.
