The self-organized nature of ad hoc networks makes the network utility-based approach an efficient way to allocate limited resources.

To efficiently address the routing problem in ad hoc networks, we integrate the cost and stability into a network utility metric, and adopt the metric to evaluate the routing optimality in a unified, opportunistic routing model. Based on this model, an efficient algorithm is designed, both centralized and distributed implementations are presented, and extensive simulations on NS-2 are conducted to verify our results.",
