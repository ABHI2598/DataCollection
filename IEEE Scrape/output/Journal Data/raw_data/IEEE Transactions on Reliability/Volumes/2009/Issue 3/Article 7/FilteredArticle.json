Failures and repairs are exponentially distributed for the two components, while the failures of the automated mechanism follow a Weibull distribution. A corrective maintenance policy is considered for each component whereas, for the automated restoration mechanism, an additional preventive maintenance is taken into account. The system is modeled with a continuous time Markov chain and two performability indicators: one performability indicator modeling the downtime, and a second one modeling the overall operational cost. Consequently, two optimal maintenance frequencies are derived: first by minimizing the downtime, and second by minimizing the overall operational cost.
