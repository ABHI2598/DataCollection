In this model, there are <i>n</i> components in the system where each component, as well as the system, can be in one of <i>M</i>+1 possible states: 0, 1,hellip, <i>m</i>. The system is in state <i>j</i> or above if there exists an integer value <i>l</i>(<i>j</i> les <i>l</i> les <i>M</i>) such that at least <i>kl</i> components are in state <i>l</i> or above. Although the model has several practical applications, existing methods for computing either the exact, or approximate reliability of these systems are computationally inefficient, and limited to very small systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient method, and a detailed algorithm to compute the exact reliability of multi-state <i>k</i> -out-of-<i>n</i> systems. The method is based on conditional probabilities, and is applicable to all cases of multi-state <i>k</i>-out-of-<i>n</i> systems: 1) constant, 2) decreasing, 3) increasing, and 4) non-monotone <i>k</i> values. The proposed algorithm is fast, and robust. The computational time complexity of the algorithm is <i>O</i>(<i>knM</i>), and the space complexity is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>+<i>M</i>) where <i>k</i>=mean{<i>k</i> <sub>i</sub>}. Using this algorithm, the reliability of very large multi-state <i>k</i>-out-of-<i>n</i> systems can be computed in a short time. For example, the exact reliability of a system with 500 components with 200 possible states can be computed in less than one second. Several numerical examples, including the published examples, are considered to illustrate the effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed method. In addition to the detailed algorithm, and theoretical background, we also provide the complete listing of the MATLAB code used in the calculations."}, "references": [{"title": "Generalized multi-state <ref_formula><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$k$</tex></ref_formula>-out-of-<ref_formula><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n$</tex>\n</ref_formula>:G systems", "context": [{"text": "a probability term used in [1], representing the probability of a system state that satisfies a specific condition; for details, refer to Section\u00a0III-A.", "sec": "", "part": ""}, {"text": " [1], [10] proposed the generalized multi-state \\$k\\$-out-of-\\$n\\$:G system model, where there can be different \\$k\\$ values with respect to different states.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " However, the reliability evaluation algorithm proposed in [1] is not efficient because it is enumerating in nature.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Although this algorithm is general, and more efficient than the algorithm proposed in [1], it is still enumerating in nature.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " We use several numerical examples, including the published examples in [1], [2], [11], to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "We consider the generalized multi-state \\$k\\$-out-of-\\$n\\$ system discussed in [1], [2], [11].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Mathematically, the system can be defined as [1]: \nAn \\$n\\$-component system is called a generalized multi-state \\$k\\$-out-of-\\$n\\$:G system if \\$\\phi({\\mmb y})\\geq j, 1\\leq j\\leq M\\$, whenever there exists an integer value \\$l(j\\leq l\\leq M)\\$ such that at least \\$k_{l}\\$ components are in state \\$l\\$ or above.", "sec": "sec2b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "\nWhen all of the components are i.i.d., [1] provide the following equation for evaluation of the probability that the system is in state \\$j\\$ for \\$j=1,2,\\cdots,M\\$.  where \\$\\beta_{l}(k)\\$ is the probability that at least one and at most \\$k_{l}-1\\$ components are in state \\$l\\$, at most \\$k_{u}-1\\$ components are in state \\$u\\$ for \\$j+1\\leq u<l\\$, the total number of components that are at states between \\$j\\$ and \\$l\\$ inclusive is \\$k\\$, and the system is in state \\$j\\$.", "sec": "sec3a", "part": "1"}, {"text": " [1] provides a way to evaluate the state distribution of decreasing multi-state \\$k\\$-out-of-\\$n\\$:G systems.", "sec": "sec3a", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The boundary condition for the recursive algorithm is Although the method proposed in [2] is general, and more efficient than the method proposed in [1], it is still enumerating in nature, and requires the storage and performance of calculations considering the vectors of \\$k\\$ values, and \\$p\\$ values (state probabilities).", "sec": "sec3b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Note that the joint distribution of \\$(n_{0},\\cdots,n_{M})\\$ follows a multinomial distribution with the probability of outcome \\$i\\$ (category \\$i\\$) in each independent trial being \\$p_{i}\\$ [1], [17].", "sec": "sec4a", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The method in [1] takes 80.45seconds, and the method in [2] takes 0.03 seconds.", "sec": "sec6b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Example 5 from [2], or example 7 from [1].", "sec": "sec6b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Example 6 from [1].", "sec": "sec6b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " As compared to the method in [1], the proposed method is almost 1 million times (841,527 times) faster for small values of \\$n\\$, and speed advantage increases further for large values of \\$n\\$.", "sec": "sec6c", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Several numerical examples, including the published examples in [1], [2], [11], are considered to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.", "sec": "sec7", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "In a binary k-out-of-n:G system, k is the minimum number of components that must work for the system to work.
