Many challenging manufacturing issues are of concern during the fabrication of MEMS, such as precise dimensional inspection, reliability modeling, burn-in scheduling, avoiding stiction, and maintenance strategies. However, only limited mathematical tools for improving MEMS reliability, quality, and productivity are currently available. This paper proposes a mathematical model to jointly determine inspection &amp; preventive replacement policies for surface-micromachined microengines subject to wear degradation, which is a major failure mechanism for certain MEMS devices. The optimal specification limits for inspection, and the replacement interval are determined by simultaneously optimizing MEMS quality and reliability. The proposed model can be used as a tool for decision-makers in MEMS manufacturing to make sound economical and operational decisions on reliability, quality, and productivity. While illustrated considering one specific microengine design, the proposed model can be applied to a broader range of MEMS devices that experience wear degradation between rubbing surfaces.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4781604", "xplore-issue": "4797896", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797896", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Simultaneous+Quality+and+Reliability+Optimization+for+Microengines+Subject+to+Degradation&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2009&author=Hao+Peng&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.2011672&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=98&endPage=105&volumeNum=58&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "30", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Degradation", "Micromechanical devices", "Inspection", "Virtual manufacturing", "Productivity", "Microelectromechanical devices", "Microelectromechanical systems", "Manufacturing industries", "Fabrication", "Job shop scheduling"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["wear", "decision making", "engines", "inspection", "micromachining", "micromechanical devices", "optimisation", "preventive maintenance", "quality control"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["decision making", "quality optimization", "reliability optimization", "microengine design", "microelectro-mechanical system", "quality standards", "MEMS fabrication", "precise dimensional inspection", "burn-in scheduling", "maintenance strategy", "productivity", "preventive replacement policies", "surface-micromachining", "wear degradation", "failure mechanism"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["wear degradation", "Burn-in", "MEMS reliability", "preventive replacement", "quality and reliability optimization", "specification limits"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Simultaneous Quality and Reliability Optimization for Microengines Subject to Degradation", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "10503038"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4797896/4781604", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Simultaneous Quality and Reliability Optimization for Microengines Subject to Degradation", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Measurement errors in degradation-based burn-in", "displayText": "Qingqing Zhai, Zhi-Sheng Ye, Jun Yang, Yu Zhao, \"Measurement errors in degradation-based burn-in\", <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety</em>, vol. 150, pp. 126, 2016, ISSN 09518320.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2016.01.015"}}, {"title": "Reliability modeling for dependent competing failure processes with changing degradation rate", "displayText": "Koosha Rafiee, Qianmei Feng, David W.
