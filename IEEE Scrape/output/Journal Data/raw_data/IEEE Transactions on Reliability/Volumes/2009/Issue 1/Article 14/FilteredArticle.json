Although the expected lifetime is shortened as the stress level increases, this information has not been incorporated so far into the associated inferential procedures. For this reason, we develop here the order restricted maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for multiple step-stress models with exponentially distributed lifetimes under Type-I, and Type-II censored sampling situations. Moreover, the existence of the unrestricted MLE for a certain stress level is conditional on observing failures at that particular stress level. Under the order restriction, MLE exist even for stress levels without observed failures, provided that these stress levels are internal. We also discuss hypothesis testing problems under order restrictions."}, "references": [{"title": "Accelerated Life Models: Modeling and Statistical Analysis", "context": [{"text": " For a comprehensive review on step-stress accelerated life-testing, we refer to Gouno & Balakrishnan [12], while related key references are the books of Nelson [21], Meeker & Escobar [18], and Bagdonavicius & Nikulin [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "V.

An optimum test plan is explored for simple step-stress test when the stress change time is an order statisti...", "documentLink": "/document/784272", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=784272", "pdfSize": "604KB"}, "id": "ref30", "text": "C.
