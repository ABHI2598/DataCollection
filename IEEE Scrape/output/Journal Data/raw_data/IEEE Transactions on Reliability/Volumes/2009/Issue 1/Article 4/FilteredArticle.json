Two characters are considered in the proposed network: 1) nodes, and arcs all have multiple possible capacities, and may fail; and 2) the capacity weight varies with arcs, nodes, and types of commodity. The purpose of this paper is to study the systems reliability, in this case the possibility that a given quantity (<i>d</i> <sub>1</sub>,<i>d</i> <sub>2</sub>) of two types of commodities can be transmitted from the source factory to the destination factory simultaneously. Such a possibility can be treated as a performance index to measure the quality level of a supply chain network. The flow model is constructed by flow assignments, and capacity vectors. The (<i>d</i> <sub>1</sub>,<i>d</i> <sub>2</sub>) -MP, which represents the capacity of each arc/node, is a minimal capacity vector meeting the demand constraint. A simple algorithm in terms of minimal paths is first proposed to generate all (<i>d</i> <sub>1</sub>,<i>d</i> <sub>2</sub>)-MP. The system reliability can then be calculated efficiently in terms of (<i>d</i> <sub>1</sub>,<i>d</i> <sub>2</sub>)-MP. Time complexity of the proposed algorithm is also analyzed."}, "references": [{"title": "Capacity consideration in reliability\nanalysis of communication systems", "context": [{"text": " Extending to a binary-state flow network [1], the capacity of each arc (the maximum flow passing through the arc per unit time) has two levels: 0, and a positive integer.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "This paper presents a simple method for deriving a symbolic reliability expression of some practical systems such as a communication system having fixed channel capacities of its links, a power distribution system having limited power ratings of its power lines, a transport system which might not allow traffic more than a particular value, or a chemical system in which oil or gas flow through pipes is permissible only up to some safe limits.
