Many techniques have been developed to mitigate the complexity of the associated models, but most of them are domain-specific, and they support the analysis of a limited class of systems. This paper provides a contribution in the definition of a general modeling framework that adopts three different types of decomposition techniques to deal with model complexity. First, a functional decomposition is applied at the system-level, thus identifying a set of subsystems, called entities, each one performing a function with respect to the validation objectives. The entities can interact with each other through some dependency relations that state how the behavior of each entity can affect the other(s). Then a temporal decomposition is used to divide the system's lifetime in a sequence of phases such that two consecutive phases have at least one different dependency relation. Last, a model-level decomposition produces a set of separate sub-models that can be solved in isolation, passing some intermediate results between them, if and when required. This modeling framework has been applied to analyze a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) mobile telephone system. The purpose of this case-study is to demonstrate the applicability of the framework, in terms of its computational complexity, and the accuracy of the obtained results. The proposed approach provides results sufficiently accurate, though it induces some acceptable approximation. Moreover, it significantly reduces the computational complexity with respect to solving the whole non-decomposed model, and shows only a slight increase in complexity with respect to the ad-hoc solution technique specifically developed for the GPRS case-study."}, "references": [{"title": "Highly Dependable Ip-Based Networks and Services", "context": [{"text": " This property is extremely useful when the system to be evaluated is very complex in terms of network heterogeneity, size of the infrastructure, number of components, system dynamicity, and variety of threats, as in the case of the HIDENETS [1], and CRUTIAL [2] systems.", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "<em>Highly Dependable Ip-Based Networks and Services</em>.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Critical Utility Infrastructural Resilience", "context": [{"text": " This property is extremely useful when the system to be evaluated is very complex in terms of network heterogeneity, size of the infrastructure, number of components, system dynamicity, and variety of threats, as in the case of the HIDENETS [1], and CRUTIAL [2] systems.", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "2", "id": "ref2", "text": "<em>Critical Utility Infrastructural Resilience</em>.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Model-based evaluation: From\ndependability to security", "context": [{"text": " Several works have been presented in the literature trying to cope with the complexity problem (e.g., see [3] for a nice survey), and some of them are based on model decomposition approaches whose basic idea is to decompose a large model into a set of more tractable submodels that are solved separately, possibly exchanging some intermediate results.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "The development of techniques for quantitative, model-based evaluation of computer system dependability has a long and rich history.
