Neural estimation is computationally speedy, and can be used during network design optimization by an iterative algorithm such as tabu search, or simulated annealing. Two significant drawbacks of previous approaches to using neural networks to model system reliability are the long vector length of the inputs required to represent the network link architecture, and the specificity of the neural network model to a certain system size. Our encoding method overcomes both of these drawbacks with a compact, general set of inputs that adequately describe the likely network reliability. We computationally demonstrate both the precision of the neural network estimate of reliability, and the ability of the neural network model to generalize to a variety of network sizes, including application to three actual large scale communications networks."}, "references": [{"title": "Analysis and design of reliable\ncomputer networks", "context": [{"text": " This is consistent with the hypothesis that the agent causing failures is random [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " In a communications network topology design, the reliability computation with analytical methods or simulation is a critical part of the design problem [1], [6]\u2013[8].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "In the design of a computer network, one of the fundamental considerations is the reliability and availability of the communication paths between all pairs of centers in the network.
