This phenomenon can be called a unilateral dependency of strength on stress. To evaluate structural reliability in such cases, the stress on a structure is proposed to be a discrete random variable, and the stress dependent strength is represented by a discrete random variable that has different conditional probability mass functions under different stress amplitudes. Then a discrete stress-strength interference model with stress dependent strength is presented based on the universal generating function technique. Finally, the effectiveness of this model is demonstrated by an illustrative example.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true",
