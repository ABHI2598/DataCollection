Two characters are considered in the proposed network: 1) nodes, and arcs all have multiple possible capacities, and may fail; and 2) the capacity weight varies with arcs, nodes, and types of commodity. The purpose of this paper is to study the systems reliability, in this case the possibility that a given quantity (<i>d</i> <sub>1</sub>,<i>d</i> <sub>2</sub>) of two types of commodities can be transmitted from the source factory to the destination factory simultaneously. Such a possibility can be treated as a performance index to measure the quality level of a supply chain network. The flow model is constructed by flow assignments, and capacity vectors. The (<i>d</i> <sub>1</sub>,<i>d</i> <sub>2</sub>) -MP, which represents the capacity of each arc/node, is a minimal capacity vector meeting the demand constraint. A simple algorithm in terms of minimal paths is first proposed to generate all (<i>d</i> <sub>1</sub>,<i>d</i> <sub>2</sub>)-MP. The system reliability can then be calculated efficiently in terms of (<i>d</i> <sub>1</sub>,<i>d</i> <sub>2</sub>)-MP. Time complexity of the proposed algorithm is also analyzed.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4781606", "xplore-issue": "4797896", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797896", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=System+Reliability+Evaluation+for+a+Multistate+Supply+Chain+Network+With+Failure+Nodes+Using+Minimal+Paths&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2009&author=Yi-Kuei+Lin&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.2011660&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=34&endPage=40&volumeNum=58&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "31", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Reliability", "Supply chains", "Costs", "Production facilities", "Telecommunication computing", "Performance analysis", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Councils", "Technology management", "Materials science and technology"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["supply chains", "management science", "performance evaluation", "reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["time complexity", "system reliability evaluation", "multistate supply chain network", "failure nodes", "minimal paths", "performance index", "minimal capacity vector"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["supply chain", "Minimal paths", "multistate network", "performance evaluation"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2009", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "System Reliability Evaluation for a Multistate Supply Chain Network With Failure Nodes Using Minimal Paths", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "58", "accessionNumber": "10503032"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4797896/4781606", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "System Reliability Evaluation for a Multistate Supply Chain Network With Failure Nodes Using Minimal Paths", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Decision making procedure of demand satisfaction and production policy for capacitated production systems", "displayText": "Yi-Kuei Lin, Ping-Chen Chang, \"Decision making procedure of demand satisfaction and production policy for capacitated production systems\", <em>Expert Systems with Applications</em>, pp. , 2013, ISSN 09574174.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2013.07.096"}}, {"title": "Reliability evaluation for a manufacturing network with multiple production lines", "displayText": "Yi-Kuei Lin, Ping-Chen Chang, \"Reliability evaluation for a manufacturing network with multiple production lines\", <em>Computers & Industrial Engineering</em>, vol. 63, pp. 1209, 2012, ISSN 03608352.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2012.06.023"}}, {"title": "Performance evaluation of the croissant production line with reparable machines", "displayText": "Panagiotis H.
