The cumulative performance of these elements should meet a demand. The defender applies different actions to reduce a damage associated with system performance reduction below the demand that is caused by an external attack. There are three types of the defensive actions: providing system redundancy (deploying genuine system elements (GE) with cumulative performance exceeding the demand), deploying false elements (FE), and protecting the GE. The defender tries to allocate its total defense resource optimally among the three defensive actions by choosing the total number of GE <i>N</i>, the number of protected GE <i>K</i> , and the number of FE <i>H</i> . The attacker cannot distinguish GE from FE. It chooses the number of elements <i>Q</i> to attack, and attacks <i>Q</i> elements at random distributing its resource evenly among the attacked elements. The model considers a non-cooperative two-period minmax game between the defender and the attacker, and presents an algorithm for determining the optimal agents' strategies."}, "references": [{"title": "Protection vs. redundancy in homogeneous\nparallel systems", "context": [{"text": " Reference [1] considered the optimal resource distribution between providing redundancy, and protecting the system elements.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The models presented in [1], and [2] cannot be straightforwardly extended to consider the situation with free choice of different defensive alternatives.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The attack success probability (vulnerability) for each protected GE is determined by the contest success function [1], [2], [32]\u2013[34]  The contest success function was initially used in rent seeking, and expresses an agents' success in securing a rent dependent on efforts exerted [33].", "sec": "sec2a", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2007.10.007", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "G.
