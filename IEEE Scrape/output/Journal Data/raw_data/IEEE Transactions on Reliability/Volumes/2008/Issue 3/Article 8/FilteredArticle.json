The relationship between reliability and time, and that between the hazard rate and time, are discussed in this paper. First, according to the statistical meaning of random load application, the cumulative distribution function, and probability density function of equivalent load, when random load is applied at multiple times, are derived. Further, the reliability model of components under repeated random load, is developed. Then, the loading process described under a Poisson process, the dynamic reliability model of components without strength degeneration, and that with strength degeneration are developed respectively. Finally, the reliability, and the hazard rate of components are discussed. The result shows that, when strength doesn't degenerate, the reliability of components decreases over time, and the hazard rate of components decreases over time, too. When strength degenerates, the reliability of components decreases over time more obviously, and the hazard rate curve is bathtub-shaped."}, "references": [{"title": "Extended block diagram method for a multi-state\nsystem reliability assessment", "context": [{"text": " For general components and systems, these models can't reflect the effect of times of load action on reliability explicitly [1]\u2013[4].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2006.09.013", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "A.
