When the covariates collected along with exponential failure times are time dependent, the responses of an object exhibit non-stationary correlations. We examine the effects of the covariates by taking this non-stationary correlation structure into account. First, we develop Gaussian type non-stationary AR(1), MA(1), and exchangeable correlation structures for the repeated exponential failure times; and then exploit the suitable auto-correlation structure to obtain consistent, efficient estimates for the effects of the covariates by using a generalized quasi-likelihood (GQL) estimating equation approach. The finite sample estimation performance of the GQL approach is examined through a simulation study."}, "references": [{"title": "First-order autoregressive gamma sequences\nand point processes", "context": [{"text": " Models of the other marginal distributions such as gamma, Poisson, and negative binomial have also been studied by various authors [1], [3], [5]\u2013[7].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1426429", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "D.
