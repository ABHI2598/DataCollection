The relationship between reliability and time, and that between the hazard rate and time, are discussed in this paper. First, according to the statistical meaning of random load application, the cumulative distribution function, and probability density function of equivalent load, when random load is applied at multiple times, are derived. Further, the reliability model of components under repeated random load, is developed. Then, the loading process described under a Poisson process, the dynamic reliability model of components without strength degeneration, and that with strength degeneration are developed respectively. Finally, the reliability, and the hazard rate of components are discussed. The result shows that, when strength doesn't degenerate, the reliability of components decreases over time, and the hazard rate of components decreases over time, too. When strength degenerates, the reliability of components decreases over time more obviously, and the hazard rate curve is bathtub-shaped.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4585406", "xplore-issue": "4610050", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610050", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Dynamic+Reliability+Model+of+Components+Under+Random+Load&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2008&author=Wang+Zheng&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.928184&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=474&endPage=479&volumeNum=57&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "15", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Hazards", "Random variables", "Reliability theory", "Distribution functions", "Probability density function", "Aerodynamics", "Statistical distributions", "Differential equations", "Load modeling", "Large scale integration"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "differential equations", "Poisson distribution"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["components hazard rate", "components dynamic reliability model", "random load", "probability differential equations", "cumulative distribution function", "probability density function", "Poisson process"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability model", "Component reliability", "dynamic reliability", "hazard rate", "random load"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Dynamic Reliability Model of Components Under Random Load", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10185424"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4610050/4585406", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Dynamic Reliability Model of Components Under Random Load", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Reliability and sensitivity of bogie frame of high-speed train with strength degradation", "displayText": "Hao L\u00fc, Yi-min Zhang, Xu-fang Zhang, Hao Lu, \"Reliability and sensitivity of bogie frame of high-speed train with strength degradation\", <em>Journal of Central South University</em>, vol. 20, pp. 3490, 2013, ISSN 2095-2899.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11771-013-1873-4"}}, {"title": "Reliability estimation of structures under stochastic loading\u2014A case study on nuclear piping", "displayText": "M.
