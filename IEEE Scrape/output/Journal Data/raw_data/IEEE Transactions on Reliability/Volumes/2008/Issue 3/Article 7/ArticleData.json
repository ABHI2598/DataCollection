For both warranted, and nonwarranted products, cost models are developed, and the corresponding optimal replacement ages are derived such that the long-run expected cost rate is minimized. Furthermore, we show that the optimal replacement age for a warranted product is closer to the end of the warranty period than for a nonwarranted product.
