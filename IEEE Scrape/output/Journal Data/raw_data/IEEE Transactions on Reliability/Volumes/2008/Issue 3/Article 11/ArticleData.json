Times to failure, and times to repair of the operating units are assumed to follow fuzzified exponential distributions. In addition, the recovery times, and reboot times of the failed units also follow fuzzified exponential distributions. The alpha-cut approach is used to extract the fuzzy repairable system from a family of conventional crisp intervals for the desired system characteristics, determined with a set of parametric nonlinear programs using their membership functions. Two numerical examples illustrate the practicality of the proposed approach. Because the system characteristics are governed by the membership functions, more information is provided for use by designers and practitioners. The successful extension of the parameter spaces to fuzzy environments permits the repairable system to have wider practical applications.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4558431", "xplore-issue": "4610050", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610050", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Parametric+Programming+Approach+for+a+Two-Unit+Repairable+System+With+Imperfect+Coverage%2C+Reboot+and+Fuzzy+Parameters&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2008&author=Jau-Chuan+Ke&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.927703&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=498&endPage=506&volumeNum=57&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "10", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Fuzzy systems", "Power system modeling", "Exponential distribution", "Fuzzy sets", "Availability", "Data mining", "Mathematical programming", "Steady-state", "Probability", "Statistics"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "fuzzy set theory", "mathematical programming"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["alpha-cut approach", "fuzzy sets", "imperfect coverage", "mean time to failure", "time to repair", "reboot times", "two-unit repairable system", "coverage factor", "operating unit failure", "mathematical programming"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["mean time to failure", "Fuzzy sets", "imperfect coverage", "mathematical programming"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Parametric Programming Approach for a Two-Unit Repairable System With Imperfect Coverage, Reboot and Fuzzy Parameters", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10185417"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4610050/4558431", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Parametric Programming Approach for a Two-Unit Repairable System With Imperfect Coverage, Reboot and Fuzzy Parameters", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A repairable system with imperfect coverage and reboot: Bayesian and asymptotic estimation", "displayText": "Ying-Lin Hsu, Ssu-Lang Lee, Jau-Chuan Ke, \"A repairable system with imperfect coverage and reboot: Bayesian and asymptotic estimation\", <em>Mathematics and Computers in Simulation</em>, vol. 79, pp. 2227, 2009, ISSN 03784754.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matcom.2008.12.018"}}, {"title": "Statistical Inference for the Availability of Repairable System with General Repair, Reboot Delay and Switching Failure", "displayText": "Tzu-Hsin Liu, Jau-Chuan Ke, St\u00e9phane M.F.
