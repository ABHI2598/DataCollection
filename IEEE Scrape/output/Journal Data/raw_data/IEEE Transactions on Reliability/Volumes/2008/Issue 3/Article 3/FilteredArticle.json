The time to failure due to a specific risk is described by a Weibull model. These failure times of risks are assumed to be <i>s</i>-independent, and the minimum of these times is the life of the product under test. Expressions for the Fisher information matrix, often used in ALT planning, are presented. Minimum asymptotic variance of estimators and determinant-based criteria are discussed, and related to goals of testing. The proposed method is applied to the planning of ALT of Class-B insulation of motorettes."}, "references": [{"title": "Accelerated Testing: Statistical Models, Test Plans, and Data Analyses", "context": [{"text": " Chapter 7 of [1], and [2] enumerate engineering situations when a product fails because of two or more risks.", "sec": "sec1b1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Chapter 7 of [1] discussed models and analyses of competing risks data.", "sec": "sec1b2", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Reference [1] is devoted to the study of ALT.", "sec": "sec1b3", "part": "1"}, {"text": " These results are included in Chapter 6 of [1].", "sec": "sec1b3", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The method was demonstrated using the class-H insulation example in Chapter 7 of [1].", "sec": "sec1c", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Reference [1] provided data from ALT of the Class-B insulation system in motorettes.", "sec": "sec7", "part": "1"}, {"text": " See Chapter 2 of [1], and Chapter 18 of [12] for discussions.", "sec": "sec7", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "W.
