In this paper, we propose an integer linear programming approach that gives an approximate feasible solution, close to the optimal solution, together with an upper bound on the optimal reliability. We show that integer linear programming is a useful approach for solving this reliability problem. The mathematical programming model is relatively simple. Its implementation is immediate by using a mathematical programming language, and integer linear programming software.
