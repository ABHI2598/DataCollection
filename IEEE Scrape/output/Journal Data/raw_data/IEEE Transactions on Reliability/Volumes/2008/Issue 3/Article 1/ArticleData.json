Based on scanning electron microscope measurements, we establish probability distributions of four involved variables: whisker length, orientation, origin location, and counts. A failure probability model is developed and used to calculate the failure probability in terms of two types of failure definition: 1) national electronics manufacturing initiative (NEMI) acceptance criteria, and 2) leads bridging caused by tin whiskers. Results indicate that, in terms of the NEMI criteria, there is more than a 50% chance that the connectors would fail to meet the maximum allowable whisker length for class 2 products at six-month ambient storage, while the probability goes up to 74% for class 2, or 62% for class 3 at one year. However, the failure probability for tin whisker caused leads bridging is fairly low, only 0.0002% for six-month storage, 0.0074% for one-year storage, and even 0.0515 % for five-year storage. Therefore, although the connectors may fail to meet NEMI acceptance criteria for maximum allowable whisker length, the whiskers do not pose significant field risk to cause leads bridging at ambient storage.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4558430", "xplore-issue": "4610050", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4610050", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Failure+Probability+Evaluation+Due+to+Tin+Whiskers+Caused+Leads+Bridging+on+Compressive+Contact+Connectors&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2008&author=Wei+Huang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.927704&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=426&endPage=430&volumeNum=57&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "2", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Tin", "Contacts", "Connectors", "Lead", "Scanning electron microscopy", "Weibull distribution", "Consumer electronics", "Length measurement", "Probability distribution", "Virtual manufacturing"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["whiskers (crystal)", "electric connectors", "electrical contacts", "failure analysis", "scanning electron microscopes", "statistical distributions", "tin"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["Sn", "failure probability evaluation", "tin whiskers", "compressive contact connectors", "scanning electron microscope measurements", "probability distributions", "national electronics manufacturing initiative", "leads bridging"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["tin whisker", "Failure probability", "multiple random variables", "Poisson distribution", "three-parameter Weibull distribution"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Failure Probability Evaluation Due to Tin Whiskers Caused Leads Bridging on Compressive Contact Connectors", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10185415"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4610050/4558430", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Failure Probability Evaluation Due to Tin Whiskers Caused Leads Bridging on Compressive Contact Connectors", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"title": "A Novel Model of Reliability Assessment for Circular Electrical Connectors", "displayText": "Yi Ren, Qiang Feng, Tianyuan Ye, Bo Sun, \"A Novel Model of Reliability Assessment for Circular Electrical Connectors\", <em>Components Packaging and Manufacturing Technology IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 5, pp. 755-761, 2015, ISSN 2156-3950.", "order": "1", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7109137", "pdfSize": "3251KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7109137"}}, {"title": "IEEE Reliability Society Technical Operations Annual Technology Report for 2008", "displayText": "\"IEEE Reliability Society Technical Operations Annual Technology Report for 2008\", <em>Reliability IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 58, pp. 210-261, 2009, ISSN 0018-9529.", "order": "2", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5062554", "pdfSize": "2785KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5062554"}}]}, "mlTime": "PT0.05246S", "title": "Failure Probability Evaluation Due to Tin Whiskers Caused Leads Bridging on Compressive Contact Connectors", "lastupdate": "2016-11-12T01:54:57", "ieeeCitationCount": "2", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0"}, "references": [{"id": "ref1", "refType": "biblio", "context": [{"sec": "sec1", "part": "1", "text": "Driven by government legislation [1], [2] and market forces, Pb-free electronics have been implemented in most consumer products."}], "title": "Directive 2002/96/EC of The European\nParliament and of the council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic\nequipment (WEEE)", "order": "1", "text": "\"Directive 2002/96/EC of The European\nParliament and of the council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic\nequipment (WEEE)\", <em>Official Journal of The European Union</em>, no.
