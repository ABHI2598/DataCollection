Times to failure, and times to repair of the operating units are assumed to follow fuzzified exponential distributions. In addition, the recovery times, and reboot times of the failed units also follow fuzzified exponential distributions. The alpha-cut approach is used to extract the fuzzy repairable system from a family of conventional crisp intervals for the desired system characteristics, determined with a set of parametric nonlinear programs using their membership functions. Two numerical examples illustrate the practicality of the proposed approach. Because the system characteristics are governed by the membership functions, more information is provided for use by designers and practitioners. The successful extension of the parameter spaces to fuzzy environments permits the repairable system to have wider practical applications."}, "references": [{"title": "Bibliography for reliability and availability of stochastic\nsystems", "context": [{"text": " Redundant repairable systems have been studied extensively in the past, and detailed bibliographies are found in Osaki & Nakagawa [1], and Srinivasan & Subramanian [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "A brief review of stochastic models on system-reliability lists selected references on system reliability models using stochastic processes such as Markov chains, Markov processes, renewal processes, and semi-Markov (Markov renewal) processes.", "documentLink": "/document/5219999", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5219999", "pdfSize": "851KB"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "S.
