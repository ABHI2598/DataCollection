This paper presents a design stage method for assessing performance reliability of systems with competing time-variant responses due to components with uncertain degradation rates. Herein, system performance measures (e.g. selected responses) are related to their critical levels by time dependent limit-state functions. System failure is defined as the non-conformance of any response, and hence unions of the multiple failure regions are formed. For discrete time, set theory establishes the minimum union size needed to identify a true incremental failure region that emerges from a safe region. A cumulative failure distribution function is built by summing incremental failure probabilities. A practical implementation of the theory is manifest through evaluating probabilities by Monte Carlo simulation. Error analysis suggests ways to predict and minimize errors. An electrical temperature controller shows the details of the method, and the potential of the approach. It is shown that the proposed method provides a more realistic way to predict performance reliability than either worst-case, or simple average-based approaches that are available in the open literature.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4505534", "xplore-issue": "4538180", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538180", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+New+Sample-Based+Approach+to+Predict+System+Performance+Reliability&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2008&author=Young+Kap+Son&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.920864&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=322&endPage=330&volumeNum=57&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "4", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["System performance", "Degradation", "Time measurement", "Performance loss", "Set theory", "Predictive models", "Statistical distributions", "Random variables", "Loss measurement", "Design methodology"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["statistical distributions", "error analysis", "Monte Carlo methods", "reliability", "reliability theory"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["electrical temperature controller", "performance reliability", "multiple degradation paths", "systems performance reliability", "design stage method", "uncertain degradation rates", "time dependent limit-state functions", "system failure", "discrete time", "set theory", "cumulative failure distribution function", "Monte Carlo simulation", "error analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["systems performance reliability", "Component degradation", "Monte Carlo simulation", "random environmental conditions", "set theory"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A New Sample-Based Approach to Predict System Performance Reliability", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10050604"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4538180/4505534", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A New Sample-Based Approach to Predict System Performance Reliability", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A Tolerance Design Method for Electronic Circuits Based on Performance Degradation", "displayText": "Guofu Zhai, Yuege Zhou, Xuerong Ye, \"A Tolerance Design Method for Electronic Circuits Based on Performance Degradation\", <em>Quality and Reliability Engineering International</em>, vol. 31, pp. 635, 2015, ISSN 07488017.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qre.1621"}}, {"title": "Reliability prediction of engineering systems with competing failure modes due to component degradation", "displayText": "Young Kap Son, \"Reliability prediction of engineering systems with competing failure modes due to component degradation\", <em>Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology</em>, vol. 25, pp. 1717, 2011, ISSN 19763824.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12206-011-0415-y"}}], "ieee": [{"title": "A new tolerance design method for LED Lamp driver with performance degradation model", "displayText": "Yuege Zhou, Xuerong Ye, Guofu Zhai, \"A new tolerance design method for LED Lamp driver with performance degradation model\", <em>Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS) 2012 Proceedings - Annual</em>, pp. 1-6, 2012, ISSN 0149-144X.", "order": "1", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6175477", "pdfSize": "756KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6175477"}}, {"title": "Approximate Reliability Function Based on Wavelet Latin Hypercube Sampling and Bee Recurrent Neural Network", "displayText": "Wei-Chang Yeh, Jack C.
