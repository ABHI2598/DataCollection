One of the main concerns in SPS deployment is to ensure that the system will fit with the reliability requirement specification in terms of dependability, and security. After major changes in system operating practices, or physical changes of the protected system, a refinement of the SPS decision process may be required. This paper uses a currently operational SPS as an example to demonstrate a refinement study. By incorporating an interval theory, a risk reduction worth importance concept, and a probabilistic risk-based index, the proposed procedure conducts parameter uncertainty analysis, identifies critical factors in the reliability model, performs risk assessments, and determines a better option for the refinement of the studied SPS decision process logic module."}, "references": [{"title": "System Protection Schemes in Power Networks,", "context": [{"text": " These systems are sometimes perceived as attractive alternatives to constructing new transmission facilities [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "<em>System Protection Schemes in Power Networks</em>, 2001.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "NERC Planning Standard", "context": [{"text": " These systems are sometimes perceived as attractive alternatives to constructing new transmission facilities [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "2", "id": "ref2", "text": "<em>NERC Planning Standard</em>, Sep. 1997,  [online]  Available: http://www.nerc.com.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Power System Protection", "context": [{"text": " The reliability concepts, models, and analysis methods, including reliability block diagrams, fault trees, success trees, and Markov processes for protection systems as well as system protection schemes were all described in [3].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "3", "id": "ref3", "text": "P.
