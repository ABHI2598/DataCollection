The hidden degradation process is firstly identified by use of particle filtering based on measurable outputs of the considered dynamic system. Then the system's reliability is predicted according to the model of the degradation path. We analyze the identification algorithm mathematically, and validate the effectiveness of this method through computer simulations of a three-vessel water tank. This real-time reliability prediction method is beneficial to the dynamic system's condition monitoring, and may be further helpful to make a proper predictive maintenance policy for the system.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4453878", "xplore-issue": "4538180", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538180", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Real-time+Reliability+Prediction+for+a+Dynamic+System+Based+on+the+Hidden+Degradation+Process+Identification&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2008&author=Zhengguo+Xu&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.916882&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=230&endPage=242&volumeNum=57&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "53", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Real time systems", "Degradation", "Prediction methods", "Filtering", "Particle measurements", "Reliability", "Predictive models", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Computer simulation", "Condition monitoring"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "condition monitoring", "filtering theory", "maintenance engineering"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["predictive maintenance policy", "real-time reliability prediction method", "dynamic system", "hidden degradation process identification", "particle filtering", "three-vessel water tank", "condition monitoring"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["real-time reliability prediction", "Degradation", "Dynamic systems", "particle filtering", "predictive maintenance"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Real-time Reliability Prediction for a Dynamic System Based on the Hidden Degradation Process Identification", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10050607"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4538180/4453878", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Real-time Reliability Prediction for a Dynamic System Based on the Hidden Degradation Process Identification", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A modified profust-performance-reliability algorithm and its application to dynamic systems", "displayText": "Zhiyao Zhao, Quan Quan, Kai-Yuan Cai, \"A modified profust-performance-reliability algorithm and its application to dynamic systems\", <em>Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems</em>, pp. 1, 2017, ISSN 10641246.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JIFS-152544"}}, {"title": "Real-time Lifetime Prediction Method Based on Wavelet Support Vector Regression and Fuzzy <I>c</I>-means Clustering", "displayText": "You-Tao HU, Chang-Hua HU, Xiang-Yu KONG, Zhi-Jie ZHOU, \"Real-time Lifetime Prediction Method Based on Wavelet Support Vector Regression and Fuzzy <I>c</I>-means Clustering\", <em>Acta Automatica Sinica</em>, vol. 38, pp. 331, 2012, ISSN 0254-4156.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1004.2012.00331"}}, {"title": "State-Based Prognostics with State Duration Information", "displayText": "O.
