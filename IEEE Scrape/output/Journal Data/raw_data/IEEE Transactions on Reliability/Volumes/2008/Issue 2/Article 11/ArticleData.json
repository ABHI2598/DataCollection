One of the main concerns in SPS deployment is to ensure that the system will fit with the reliability requirement specification in terms of dependability, and security. After major changes in system operating practices, or physical changes of the protected system, a refinement of the SPS decision process may be required. This paper uses a currently operational SPS as an example to demonstrate a refinement study. By incorporating an interval theory, a risk reduction worth importance concept, and a probabilistic risk-based index, the proposed procedure conducts parameter uncertainty analysis, identifies critical factors in the reliability model, performs risk assessments, and determines a better option for the refinement of the studied SPS decision process logic module.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4488173", "xplore-issue": "4538180", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538180", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Risk+Informed+Design+Refinement+of+a+Power+System+Protection+Scheme&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2008&author=Tsun-Yu+Hsiao&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.920796&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=311&endPage=321&volumeNum=57&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "13", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Power system protection", "Probability", "Risk management", "Risk analysis", "Power system reliability", "System testing", "Circuit breakers", "Failure analysis", "Fault trees", "Power system security"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["risk management", "fault trees", "power system faults", "power system protection", "power system reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["probabilistic risk-based index", "risk informed design refinement", "power system protection scheme", "wide-area disturbances", "power system reliability", "system operating practices", "risk reduction"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["uncertainty", "Fault tree analysis", "interval analysis", "probabilistic risk assessment", "remedial action scheme", "sensitivity", "special protection system", "system protection scheme"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Risk Informed Design Refinement of a Power System Protection Scheme", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10050598"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4538180/4488173", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Risk Informed Design Refinement of a Power System Protection Scheme", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Design of dependable and secure system integrity protection schemes", "displayText": "Mathaios Panteli, Peter A.
