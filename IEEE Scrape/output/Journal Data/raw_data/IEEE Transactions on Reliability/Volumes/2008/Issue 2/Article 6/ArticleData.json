One of the problems can be traced to the variety of terminologies used in describing performance across different fields. A designer or user is faced with vague terms that may be complementary, synonymous, or some combination thereof. There is a need to develop a common understanding of the meaning of widely used terms without reference to a specific discipline. The work described in this paper aims to develop a framework that helps identify a set of performance indicators for complex systems, such as information infrastructures. The objective is not to propose yet another concept, but rather to identify from the existing concepts the proper definitions, attributes, intersections, and evaluation measures. Dependability, fault-tolerance, reliability/availability, security, and survivability are used as representative examples for describing the proposed framework. This framework could eventually help furnish the basis towards adoption of standard terminology.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4488171", "xplore-issue": "4538180", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538180", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Towards+a+Standardized+Terminology+for+Network+Performance&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2008&author=Mohamed+H.+Al-Kuwaiti&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.920800&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=267&endPage=271&volumeNum=57&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "1", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Terminology", "Availability", "Performance analysis", "Fault tolerance", "Information security", "Computer networks", "Fault tolerant systems", "Humans", "System performance", "Communication networks"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "fault tolerance", "large-scale systems"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["security", "standardized terminology", "human component", "diverse fields", "complex systems", "performance indicators", "information infrastructures", "dependability", "fault-tolerance", "survivability"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["survivability", "Dependability", "fault-tolerance", "performance measures", "security"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Towards a Standardized Terminology for Network Performance", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10050589"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4538180/4488171", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Towards a Standardized Terminology for Network Performance", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"title": "A Novel Transient System Survivability Quantitative Evaluation Framework", "displayText": "Jipeng Huang, Jianhui Jiang, Liyuan Zhang, \"A Novel Transient System Survivability Quantitative Evaluation Framework\", <em>Computer Engineering and Applications (ICCEA) 2010 Second International Conference on</em>, vol. 2, pp. 34-39, 2010.", "order": "1", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5445629", "pdfSize": "320KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5445629"}}]}, "mlTime": "PT0.047702S", "title": "Towards a Standardized Terminology for Network Performance", "lastupdate": "2016-11-15T06:53:05", "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0"}, "references": [{"id": "ref1", "refType": "biblio", "context": [{"sec": "sec1", "part": "1", "text": " Examples of these systems can be found in [1], [2], [5], [12]."}], "title": "Dependability and Complexity: Exploring Ideas for Studying Open Systems,", "order": "1", "text": "N.
