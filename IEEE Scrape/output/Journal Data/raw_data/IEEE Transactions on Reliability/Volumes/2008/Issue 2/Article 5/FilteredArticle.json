Confidence intervals are used to quantify the <i>s</i>-uncertainty of estimators of these two metrics. In practice, a set of pointwise confidence intervals for <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>), or the quantiles <i>t</i> <sub>p</sub> are often plotted on one graph, which we refer to as pointwise ldquoconfidence bands.rdquo These confidence bands for <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>) or <i>t</i> <sub>p</sub> can be obtained through <i>s</i>-normal approximation, maximum likelihood, or other procedures. In this paper, we compare <i>s</i>-normal approximation to likelihood methods, and introduce a new procedure to get the confidence intervals for <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>) by inverting the pointwise confidence bands of the quantile <i>t</i> <sub>p</sub> function. We show why it is valid to interpret the set of pointwise confidence intervals for the quantile function as a set of pointwise confidence intervals for <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>), and vice-versa. Our results also indicate that the likelihood-based pointwise confidence bands have desirable statistical properties, beyond those that were known previously."}, "references": [{"title": "MINITAB Statistical Software, Release 15 for Windows", "context": [{"text": " Popular software packages that easily provide such graphics include MINITAB [1], WEIBULL++ [2], PROC RELIABILITY in SAS [3], and S-PLUS/SPLIDA in [4].", "sec": "sec1a", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "<em>MINITAB Statistical Software Release 15 for Windows</em>, 2006.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Life Data Analysis (Weibull Analysis) Software", "context": [{"text": " Popular software packages that easily provide such graphics include MINITAB [1], WEIBULL++ [2], PROC RELIABILITY in SAS [3], and S-PLUS/SPLIDA in [4].", "sec": "sec1a", "part": "1"}], "order": "2", "id": "ref2", "text": "<em>Life Data Analysis (Weibull Analysis) Software</em>, 2007,  [online]  Available: http://weibull.reliasoft.com/.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "SAS/QC User's Guide", "context": [{"text": " Popular software packages that easily provide such graphics include MINITAB [1], WEIBULL++ [2], PROC RELIABILITY in SAS [3], and S-PLUS/SPLIDA in [4].", "sec": "sec1a", "part": "1"}], "order": "3", "id": "ref3", "text": "<em>SAS/QC User's Guide</em>, 2003.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "SPLIDA (S-PLUS Life Data Analysis)", "context": [{"text": " Popular software packages that easily provide such graphics include MINITAB [1], WEIBULL++ [2], PROC RELIABILITY in SAS [3], and S-PLUS/SPLIDA in [4].", "sec": "sec1a", "part": "1"}], "order": "4", "id": "ref4", "text": "W.
