This paper provides a thorough study on SSP under the GMPLS-based recovery framework, where an effective survivable routing algorithm for SSP is proposed. The tradeoff between the price (i.e., cost representing the amount of resources, and the blocking probability), and the restoration time is extensively studied by simulations on three networks with highly dynamic traffic. We demonstrate that the proposed survivable routing algorithm can be a powerful solution for meeting stringent delay upper bounds for achieving high restorability of transport services. This can significantly improve the network reliability, and enable more advanced, mission critical services in the networks. The comparison among the three protection types further verifies that the proposed scheme can yield significant advantages over shared path protection, and shared link protection.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4515952", "xplore-issue": "4538180", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538180", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+New+Shared+Segment+Protection+Method+for+Survivable+Networks+with+Guaranteed+Recovery+Time&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2008&author=J%C3%81nos+Tapolcai&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.923480&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=272&endPage=282&volumeNum=57&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "26", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Protection", "Cost function", "Optical packet switching", "Routing", "Upper bound", "Optical fiber networks", "SONET", "Optical signal processing", "Synchronous digital hierarchy", "High speed optical techniques"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["telecommunication traffic", "multiprotocol label switching", "telecommunication network reliability", "telecommunication network routing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["network reliability", "shared segment protection method", "survivable network", "guaranteed recovery time", "shared path protection", "shared link protection", "spare capacity sharing maximization", "generalized multiprotocol label switching", "GMPLS-based recovery framework", "survivable routing algorithm", "dynamic network traffic"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["working and protection paths", "Complete routing information scenario", "integer linear program (ILP)", "segment shared protection (SSP)", "shared risk group (SRG)", "single failure scenario"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A New Shared Segment Protection Method for Survivable Networks with Guaranteed Recovery Time", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10050605"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4538180/4515952", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A New Shared Segment Protection Method for Survivable Networks with Guaranteed Recovery Time", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Independent Transient Plane Design for Protection in OpenFlow-Based Networks", "displayText": "Nattapong Kitsuwan, S\u00e9amas McGettrick, Frank Slyne, David B.
