However, this is only a partial optimization. There are two options to improve the system utility of a multi-state series-parallel system: 1) to provide redundancy at each stage, and 2) to improve the component state distribution, that is, make a component in states with respect to higher utilities with higher probabilities. This paper presents an optimization model for a multi-state series-parallel system to jointly determine the optimal component state distribution, and optimal redundancy for each stage. The relationship between component state distribution, and component cost is discussed based on an assumption on the treatment on the components. An example is used to illustrate the optimization model with its solution approach, and that the proposed reliability-redundancy allocation model is superior to the current redundancy allocation models.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4505535", "xplore-issue": "4538180", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538180", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Reliability-Redundancy+Allocation+for+Multi-State+Series-Parallel+Systems&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2008&author=Zhigang+Tian&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.920871&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=303&endPage=310&volumeNum=57&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "25", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Redundancy", "Cost function", "Industrial electronics", "Reliability", "Information systems", "Systems engineering and theory", "Mechanical engineering", "Industrial engineering", "Aggregates", "Delta modulation"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "optimisation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["component state distribution", "reliability-redundancy allocation", "multistate series-parallel systems"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["state distribution", "Multi-state series-parallel system", "optimization", "reliability-redundancy allocation"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability-Redundancy Allocation for Multi-State Series-Parallel Systems", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10050606"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4538180/4505535", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability-Redundancy Allocation for Multi-State Series-Parallel Systems", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "OPTIMAL DESIGN OF A MULTI-STATE WEIGHTED SERIES-PARALLEL SYSTEM USING PHYSICAL PROGRAMMING AND GENETIC ALGORITHMS", "displayText": "WEI LI, MING J.
