The hidden degradation process is firstly identified by use of particle filtering based on measurable outputs of the considered dynamic system.

We analyze the identification algorithm mathematically, and validate the effectiveness of this method through computer simulations of a three-vessel water tank. This real-time reliability prediction method is beneficial to the dynamic system's condition monitoring, and may be further helpful to make a proper predictive maintenance policy for the system."}, "references": [{"title": "Risk assessment for dynamic systems: An overview", "context": [{"text": "Reliability evaluation of complex dynamic systems, such as signal systems of high speed trains, has attracted more attention in recent years [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0951-8320(94)90095-7", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "N.
