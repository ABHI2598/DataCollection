Mapping from traffic paths to physical elements and capacities enables the model to express simply how terrible performance degradations occur. Existing models, such as probability graph models, and probability-capacity graph models, do not adequately address actual telecommunication network designs. The probability graph model never considers performance degradations, while the probability-capacity model unreasonably assumes that we can estimate performance degradations from only the network topology. This paper also proposes an algorithm for evaluating the reliability of our new model. A numerical example shows that the algorithm is reasonably efficient for even large telecommunications networks."}, "references": [{"title": "An improved algorithm for network reliability", "context": [{"text": " Many researchers have emphasized that such evaluations are useful in designing reliable telecommunications networks [1]\u2013[6].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "In probability graph models [1]\u2013[6], nodes represent routers, switching systems, cross-connects, and repeaters; and links represent optical fibers, and metal cables.", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The r. h. s. of (1) can be determined by various reliability calculation techniques [1], [6].", "sec": "sec4a1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " After all tie-sets have been enumerated, \\$R(N)\\$ can be computed using (1) in Section\u00a0IV-A that \\$R(N)={\\Pr}\\$(There exists a tie-set of all whose elements are working) by applying the techniques of [1], [6].", "sec": "sec4e", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Finally, \\$R(N)\\$ is obtained by the reliability calculation technique of [1] as follows.", "sec": "sec5b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "We use the algorithm in [1] to evaluate \\$R(N)\\$ by considering all tie-sets by using (1).", "sec": "sec6", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "Boolean algebra has been used to find the probability of communication between a pair of nodes in a network by starting with a Boolean product corresponding to simple paths between the pair of nodes and making them disjoint (mutually exclusive).
