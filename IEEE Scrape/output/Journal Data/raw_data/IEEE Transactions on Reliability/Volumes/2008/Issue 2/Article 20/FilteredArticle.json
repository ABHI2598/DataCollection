The proposed model is developed with the Bayesian survival analysis method, and thus the problems for censored (or truncated) data in reliability tests can be resolved. In addition, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on Gibbs sampling is used to dynamically simulate the Markov chain of the parameterspsila posterior distribution. Finally, a numeric example is discussed to demonstrate the proposed model."}, "references": [{"title": "A change-point analysis for modeling incomplete\nburn-in for light displays", "context": [{"text": " Recently, [1] showed that reliability estimation could be improved substantially by using the change-points model to account for product burn-in effects.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/074081791009068", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "S.
