Confidence intervals are used to quantify the <i>s</i>-uncertainty of estimators of these two metrics. In practice, a set of pointwise confidence intervals for <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>), or the quantiles <i>t</i> <sub>p</sub> are often plotted on one graph, which we refer to as pointwise ldquoconfidence bands.rdquo These confidence bands for <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>) or <i>t</i> <sub>p</sub> can be obtained through <i>s</i>-normal approximation, maximum likelihood, or other procedures. In this paper, we compare <i>s</i>-normal approximation to likelihood methods, and introduce a new procedure to get the confidence intervals for <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>) by inverting the pointwise confidence bands of the quantile <i>t</i> <sub>p</sub> function. We show why it is valid to interpret the set of pointwise confidence intervals for the quantile function as a set of pointwise confidence intervals for <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>), and vice-versa.
