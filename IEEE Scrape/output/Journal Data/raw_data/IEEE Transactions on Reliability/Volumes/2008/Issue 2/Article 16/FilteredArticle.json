His industrial experience includes two years as a software engineer with Siemens, and two years as a research engineer working in reliability of offshore structures. From 1987 to 1990, he was a research fellow in the Centre for Software Reliability, at The City University, London. From 1990 to 1995, he was a lecturer in Computer Science at Aston University, Birmingham. Since 1995, he has been with the School of Informatics at the University of Bradford where he is a Lecturer.

Flowgraphs are used to represent semi-Markov reliability models. They are directed graphs with edges labeled with expressions of the form pG(s), where p is the probability of transition from node i to node j, say; and G(s) is the transform (Laplace transform, moment generating function, or characteristic function) of the waiting time in i given that the next transition is to j. Usually, transforms of waiting time distributions (e.g. time to first failure) are obtained from these graph representations by applying Mason's Rule (e.g. Huzurbazar, Mason, and Osaki), or, by the Cofactor Rule. In this paper we are concerned with obtaining transforms of waiting times by direct manipulation of the flowgraphs along the lines in finite automata. The goal of the paper is to observe that identical patterns of reasoning are applicable in both fields. This interconnects two apparently unrelated fields of knowledge, an interesting observation for its own sake but also important from a tool &amp; technique point of view."}, "references": [{"title": "Reliabilities for feedback systems and their\nsaddlepoint approximation", "context": [], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/ss/1009212818", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "R.
