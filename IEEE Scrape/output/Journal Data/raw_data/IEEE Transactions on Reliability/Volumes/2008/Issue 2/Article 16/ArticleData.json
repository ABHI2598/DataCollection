Flowgraphs are used to represent semi-Markov reliability models. They are directed graphs with edges labeled with expressions of the form pG(s), where p is the probability of transition from node i to node j, say; and G(s) is the transform (Laplace transform, moment generating function, or characteristic function) of the waiting time in i given that the next transition is to j. Usually, transforms of waiting time distributions (e.g. time to first failure) are obtained from these graph representations by applying Mason's Rule (e.g. Huzurbazar, Mason, and Osaki), or, by the Cofactor Rule. In this paper we are concerned with obtaining transforms of waiting times by direct manipulation of the flowgraphs along the lines in finite automata. The goal of the paper is to observe that identical patterns of reasoning are applicable in both fields. This interconnects two apparently unrelated fields of knowledge, an interesting observation for its own sake but also important from a tool &amp; technique point of view.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4505529", "xplore-issue": "4538180", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538180", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Flowgraph+Models+in+Reliability+and+Finite+Automata&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2008&author=Attila+Csenki&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.920865&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=355&endPage=359&volumeNum=57&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "3", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Automata", "Reliability theory", "Laplace equations", "Character generation", "Feedback loop", "Informatics", "Computer science", "Random variables", "Control engineering", "Terminology"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "directed graphs", "finite automata"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["characteristic function", "flowgraph models", "finite automata", "generalized transition graphs", "directed graph", "semiMarkov reliability models", "Laplace transform", "moment generating function"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["semi-Markov models", "Bypass and state elimination algorithm", "finite automata", "flowgraphs", "Kleene's theorem", "regular expressions"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Flowgraph Models in Reliability and Finite Automata", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10050593"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4538180/4505529", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Flowgraph Models in Reliability and Finite Automata", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Flowgraph models for estimating total time of authentication process in RFID system", "displayText": "Aik Theng Tan, Zurinahni Zainol, Rahmat Budiarto, \"Flowgraph models for estimating total time of authentication process in RFID system\", <em>Journal of the Franklin Institute</em>, pp. , 2013, ISSN 00160032.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfranklin.2013.03.004"}}, {"title": "Towards a unified view of finite automata and semi-Markov flowgraph models", "displayText": "Attila Csenki, \"Towards a unified view of finite automata and semi-Markov flowgraph models\", <em>International Journal of General Systems</em>, vol. 38, pp. 643, 2009, ISSN 0308-1079.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03081070902911550"}}, {"title": "Systems Dependability Assessment", "displayText": "pp. 173, 2015, ISBN 9781119053996.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781119053996.biblio"}}]}, "mlTime": "PT0.042046S", "title": "Flowgraph Models in Reliability and Finite Automata", "lastupdate": "2016-11-12T01:54:39", "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "3"}, "references": [{"id": "ref1", "refType": "biblio", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/ss/1009212818"}, "context": [], "title": "Reliabilities for feedback systems and their\nsaddlepoint approximation", "order": "1", "text": "R.
