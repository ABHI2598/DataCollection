However, redundant <i>k</i>-out-of-<i>n</i>:G systems which are subject to imperfect fault coverage have an optimum level of redundancy, <i>n</i> <sub>opt</sub>. That is to say, additional redundancy in excess of <i>nopt</i> will result in an increase, not a decrease, in the probability of system failure. This characteristic severely limits the level of redundancy considered in the design of highly reliable systems to modest values of <i>n</i>. Correct modeling of imperfect coverage is critical to the design of highly reliable systems. Two distinctly different <i>k</i>-out-of-<i>n</i>:G imperfect fault coverage reliability models are discussed in this paper: Element Level Coverage (ELC), and Fault Level Coverage (FLC). ELC is the appropriate model when each component can be assigned a given coverage level, while FLC is the appropriate model for systems using voting as the primary means of selection among redundant components. It is shown, over a wide range of realistic coverage values and relatively high component reliabilities, that the optimal redundancy level for ELC systems is 2 and 4 for FLC systems. It is also shown that the optimal probability of failure for FLC systems exceeds that of ELC systems by several orders of magnitude.
