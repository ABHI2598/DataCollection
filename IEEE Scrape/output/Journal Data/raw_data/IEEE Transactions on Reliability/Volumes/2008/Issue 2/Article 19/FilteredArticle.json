The methodological basis of the calculations consists in discretization of the ST process through subdivision of the time axis in small segments. By this means, the process is converted into a binomial for which an algorithm, and a fast computer program have been developed; and most important of all, a tool is provided for searching for the optimal truncation. The influence of truncation by time on the Expected Test Time (ETT) characteristics was studied; and an improved truncation method, minimizing this influence, was developed. The distributions of the test times were determined. The type A plan characteristics in IEC 61124:2006 have substantial inconsistencies in the probabilities of types I &amp; II errors (up to a factor of 2), and in the ETT (up to 17%). We checked these results by using the binomial-recursive method, and by simulation. The Type C plans, reproduced from GOST R27.402:2005, are consistent; but there is scope (and need) for substantial improvement of the search algorithm for the optimal parameters."}, "references": [{"title": "Reliability test methods, plans, and environments for engineering, development, qualification, and production,", "context": [{"text": "The checking of products for reliability is an important step towards ensuring it [1]\u2013[4].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The truncation method referred to in MIL-HDBK-781A (Subsection 5.9) [1], and in IEC 61124:1997 (Subsection 7) [2], is based on the works of Epstein & Sobel [8], [9], and on Bazovsky's book [10].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The standards [1] and [2] contain formulae for the test boundary relationships as per [8], [10].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "A review of truncation methods for binomial and exponential SPRT, given in [11], covers the best-known relevant works (e.g. [20], [21]), and detailed reviews of other authors [6], [22]\u2013[24], but does not bring out something of greater interest than the material available in [1], [8]\u2013[10].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The methodology described in [8], [9] has been in use for more than 50 years, and that of [1] for more than 20 years, which bears evidence of its satisfactory quality.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The approach in choosing the TA position differs from that adopted in [1], [2], and its application to the experimental SPRT is also one of the purposes of this work.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The SPRT described at the beginning of this paper was included long ago in MIL-HDBK-781A [1], Subsection 5.9, and receives much practical application in the field of Reliability.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The more recent edition of the latter [3] presents several types of plans, including A, and C, based on the principles outlined in [1], Subsection 5.9, [8].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " In Section\u00a0III, we present an analysis of the construction of the boundaries of the SPRT plans as per [1], [2];
