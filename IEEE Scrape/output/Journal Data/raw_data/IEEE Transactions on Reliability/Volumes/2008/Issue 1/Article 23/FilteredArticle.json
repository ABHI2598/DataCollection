The basic principle of error-tolerance is that some chips may occasionally produce erroneous outputs, but still provide acceptable performance when used in certain systems. Using these chips in such systems results in an increase in effective yield. In this paper, a fault-oriented test methodology is presented for classifying whether or not a chip is acceptable based on error rate estimation. A sampling method is proposed to estimate error rate associated with each possible fault in the target circuit. According to this information, an approach is developed to identify a list of faults that are acceptable with respect to a specified upper bound on expected error rates of acceptable chips. Furthermore, a test pattern selection method, and an output masking technique are presented to identify tests which detect all of the unacceptable faults, and as few acceptable faults as possible, so as to maximize the effective yield. Experimental results indicate the high effectiveness of the proposed error rate estimation method, and the degree to which yield can be enhanced."}, "references": [{"title": "International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)", "context": [{"text": "As very large scale integrated (VLSI) process technology approaches various physical limits, process variations, process related impurities, and quantum effects in nanometer circuits make it difficult to manufacture defect-free chips, even with a mature process where only sparse, and random defects exist [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Consequently, the concept of error-tolerance has recently received much attention [1], [3]\u2013[11].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The need for error tolerance was foretold in the 2003 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) [1], where it was stated that \u201crelaxing the requirement of 100% correctness in both transient and permanent failures of signals, logic values, devices, or interconnects may reduce the cost of manufacturing, verification, and testing.\u201d How to cost-effectively determine the acceptability of manufactured chips is one of the central themes in this emerging field.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "<em>International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)</em>, 2003.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Reliable and efficient system-on-chip design", "context": [{"text": "As very large scale integrated (VLSI) process technology approaches various physical limits, process variations, process related impurities, and quantum effects in nanometer circuits make it difficult to manufacture defect-free chips, even with a mature process where only sparse, and random defects exist [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "To increase processor performance, the microprocessor industry is scaling feature sizes into the deep submicron and sub-100-nanometer regime.
