Both the developers, and users of operating systems have to utilize significant resources to evaluate, and mitigate the risk posed by these vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are discovered throughout the life of a software system by both the developers, and external testers. Vulnerability discovery models are needed that describe the vulnerability discovery process for determining readiness for release, future resource allocation for patch development, and evaluating the risk of vulnerability exploitation. Here, we analytically describe six models that have been recently proposed, and evaluate those using actual data for four major operating systems. The applicability of the proposed models, and the significance of the parameters involved are examined. The results show that some of the models tend to capture the discovery process better than others.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4454142", "xplore-issue": "4459841", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459841", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Application+of+Vulnerability+Discovery+Models+to+Major+Operating+Systems&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2008&author=Omar+H.+Alhazmi&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.916872&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=14&endPage=22&volumeNum=57&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "34", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Operating systems", "Security", "Software reliability", "Software testing", "Resource management", "Investments", "Linux", "Software systems", "Life testing", "System testing"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["software reliability", "Linux", "resource allocation", "security of data"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["resource allocation", "vulnerability discovery models", "operating systems", "security vulnerabilities", "Windows", "Linux operating systems", "software system", "patch development"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["vulnerability discovery", "Operating systems", "security", "software reliability growth models", "vulnerabilities"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Application of Vulnerability Discovery Models to Major Operating Systems", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "9913714"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4459841/4454142", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Application of Vulnerability Discovery Models to Major Operating Systems", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Modeling vulnerability discovery process in Apache and IIS HTTP servers", "displayText": "Sung-Whan Woo, HyunChul Joh, Omar H.
