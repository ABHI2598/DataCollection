The problem is the ldquoBayesian Anomaly,rdquo the difference in the system's failure probability per operation inferred from prior estimates, and test or operational experience applied at a lower-level of the system; and from the convolution of the same priors, and of the same experience applied at the system level (or any level above the first). In particular, unlike in a classical inference, the mean estimates differ critically. Although it is not possible to entirely resolve the problem, a practical procedure for mitigating it, establishing consistency among the mean and variance estimates at the two levels, is delineated.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4454145", "xplore-issue": "4459841", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459841", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=The+%26%23x201C%3BBayesian+Anomaly%26%23x201D%3B+and+Its+Practical+Mitigation&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2008&author=Lloyd+L.+Philipson&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.916870&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=171&endPage=173&volumeNum=57&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "3", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Shape", "Uncertainty", "Bayesian methods", "Space vehicles", "System testing", "Convolution", "Probability"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["space vehicles", "Bayes methods", "failure analysis", "probability", "reliability theory"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["fundamental logical problem", "Bayesian anomaly", "series system failure probability", "space launch vehicles", "convolution", "mean estimates", "variance estimates"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["system failure probability", "Anomalous inconsistency", "Bayes inference"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "The &#x201C;Bayesian Anomaly&#x201D; and Its Practical Mitigation", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "9897134"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4459841/4454145", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "The &#x201C;Bayesian Anomaly&#x201D; and Its Practical Mitigation", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Bayesian reliability when system and subsystem failure data are obtained in the same time period", "displayText": "Kyungmee O.
