We propose the MCC model in 3-D meshes, and extend the corresponding routing in 2-D meshes to 3-D meshes. We consider the positions of source &amp; destination when the new faulty components are constructed. Specifically, all faulty nodes will be contained in some disjoint fault-components, and a healthy node will be included in a faulty component only if using it in the routing will definitely cause a non-minimal routing-path. A distributed process is provided to collect &amp; distribute MCC information to a limited number of nodes along so-called boundaries. Moreover, a sufficient &amp; necessary condition is provided for the existence of a Manhattan-distance-path in the presence of our faulty components. As a result, only the routing having a Manhattan-distance-path will be activated at the source, and its success can be guaranteed by using the information of boundary in routing-decisions at the intermediate nodes. The results of our Monte-Carlo-estimate show substantial improvement of the new fault-information model in the percentage of successful Manhattan-routing conducted in 3-D meshes.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4387786", "xplore-issue": "4459841", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459841", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+New+Fault-Information+Model+for+Adaptive+%26%23x00026%3B+Minimal+Routing+in+3-D+Meshes&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2008&author=Zhen+Jiang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.909768&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=149&endPage=162&volumeNum=57&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "15", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Routing", "Computer science", "Distributed algorithms", "Large-scale systems", "Costs"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["telecommunication network routing", "fault diagnosis", "Monte Carlo methods", "telecommunication network reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["Monte-Carlo-estimates", "fault-information model", "adaptive-minimal routing", "3D meshes", "minimal-connected-component model", "Manhattan-distance-path", "nonminimal routing-path"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["3-D meshes", "Adaptive routing", "distributed algorithms", "fault-tolerant routing", "minimal routing"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A New Fault-Information Model for Adaptive &#x00026;
