The proposed method exploits the existence of logic implications in a design, and is based on selective addition of pertinent functionally redundant wires to the circuit. We demonstrate that the addition of functionally redundant wires reduces the probability that a single-event transient (SET) error will reach a primary output, and, by extension, the soft error rate (SER) of the circuit. We discuss three methods for identifying candidate functionally redundant wires, and we outline the necessary conditions for adding them to the circuit. We then present an algorithm that assesses the SET sensitization probability reduction achieved by candidate functionally redundant wires, and selects an appropriate subset that, when added to the design, minimizes its SER. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits demonstrate that the proposed soft error mitigation methodology yields a significant SER reduction at the expense of commensurate hardware, power, and delay overhead.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4454143", "xplore-issue": "4459841", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459841", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Soft+Error+Mitigation+Through+Selective+Addition+of+Functionally+Redundant+Wires&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2008&author=Sobeeh+Almukhaizim&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.916877&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=23&endPage=31&volumeNum=57&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "25", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Wires", "Logic circuits", "Error analysis", "Logic devices", "Combinational circuits", "Hardware", "Logic gates", "Distortion", "Logic design", "Algorithm design and analysis"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["redundant number systems", "combinational circuits", "logic design", "radiation effects"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["ISCAS'89 benchmark circuit", "logic-level soft error mitigation", "pertinent functionally redundant wires", "combinational circuits", "logic design", "single-event transient", "SET error"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["soft error sensitization probability", "Logic implications", "single-event transient", "soft error rate"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Soft Error Mitigation Through Selective Addition of Functionally Redundant Wires", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "9897122"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4459841/4454143", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "1", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "18 August 2015", "inventors": "Hamlet, Jason R.; Mayo, Jackson R.", "order": "1", "patentNumber": "9112490", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US9112490.pdf", "title": "Approximate circuits for increased reliability", "assignees": ["SANDIA CORP"], "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9112490.PN.&OS=PN/9112490", "filingDate": "14 October 2013", "id": "09112490", "patentAbstract": "Embodiments of the invention describe a Boolean circuit having a voter circuit and a plurality of approximate circuits each based, at least in part, on a reference circuit.
