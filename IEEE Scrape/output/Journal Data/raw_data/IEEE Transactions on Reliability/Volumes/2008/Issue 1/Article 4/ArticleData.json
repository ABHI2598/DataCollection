In this paper, we present a new inverted U-shape hazard function, developed for risk-events related to human activities. This hazard shape has received less attention in the literature relative to monotone hazard functions, likely due to the mathematical complexity of their regression models. We present a new survivor function, based on a logarithm transformation, and time displacement of Weibull's survivor function, that has an inverted U-shape hazard function similar to the log-logistic one. The advantage of this hazard function relative to the Weibull, and log-logistic hazard functions is in its unique curvature, which may fit better in some cases. We use simulation studies to present the new distribution characteristics in comparison to the Weibull, and the log-logistic distributions.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4387783", "xplore-issue": "4459841", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459841", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+New+Inverted+U-Shape+Hazard+Function&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2008&author=Tal+Avinadav&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.909773&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=32&endPage=40&volumeNum=57&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "2", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Hazards", "Shape", "Humans", "Retirement", "Mathematical model", "Weibull distribution", "Probability density function", "Risk analysis", "Logistics"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["Weibull distribution", "health hazards", "log normal distribution", "risk analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["log-logistic distributions", "inverted U-shape hazard function", "risk-events", "human activities", "hazard shape", "logarithm transformation", "time displacement", "Weibull survivor function", "distribution characteristics", "Weibull distribution"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["Weibull distribution", "Exposure time transformation", "hazard function", "log-logistic distribution", "survivor function"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A New Inverted U-Shape Hazard Function", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "9905505"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4459841/4387783", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A New Inverted U-Shape Hazard Function", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "On Crevecoeur\u2019s bathtub-shaped failure rate model", "displayText": "Junfeng Liu, Yi Wang, \"On Crevecoeur\u2019s bathtub-shaped failure rate model\", <em>Computational Statistics & Data Analysis</em>, vol. 57, pp. 645, 2013, ISSN 01679473.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2012.08.002"}}], "ieee": [{"title": "Failure rate calculating method of components based on the load-strength interference model", "displayText": "Zheng Wang, Zengquan Wang, A-na Wang, \"Failure rate calculating method of components based on the load-strength interference model\", <em>Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM) 2010 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 783-787, 2010, ISSN 2157-362X.", "order": "1", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5675602", "pdfSize": "525KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5675602"}}]}, "mlTime": "PT0.038987S", "title": "A New Inverted U-Shape Hazard Function", "lastupdate": "2016-11-14T16:59:37", "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "1"}, "references": [{"id": "ref1", "refType": "biblio", "context": [{"sec": "sec1", "part": "1", "text": "The common techniques to model dynamic failure behavior are described in Kalbfleisch & Prentice [5], Lawless [6], Cox & Oakes [3], and Allison [1] among others."}, {"sec": "sec1", "part": "1", "text": " Allison [1] indicates that an inverted U-shape hazard function may be fit for describing social mobility, in which there is an initial \u201cresting period\u201d after the previous move, an increase of the risk of a move as the resting period is completed, and a decline in the risk of a move as individuals become more invested in a particular social location."}], "title": "Event History Analysis", "order": "1", "text": "P.
