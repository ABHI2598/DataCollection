The problem is the ldquoBayesian Anomaly,rdquo the difference in the system's failure probability per operation inferred from prior estimates, and test or operational experience applied at a lower-level of the system; and from the convolution of the same priors, and of the same experience applied at the system level (or any level above the first). In particular, unlike in a classical inference, the mean estimates differ critically. Although it is not possible to entirely resolve the problem, a practical procedure for mitigating it, establishing consistency among the mean and variance estimates at the two levels, is delineated."}, "references": [{"title": "Anomalies in Bayesian launch range safety\nanalysis", "context": [{"text": " This shift is the \u201cBayesian Anomaly, described in [1], [2], and touched on, e.g. in [3], [4].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0951-8320(95)00066-B", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "L.
