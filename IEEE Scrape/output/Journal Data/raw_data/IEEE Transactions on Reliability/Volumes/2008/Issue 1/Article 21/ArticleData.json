Many real-world engineering design problems are multi-objective in nature, and among those, several of them have various levels of system performance ranging from perfectly functioning to completely failed. This multi-objective genetic algorithm uses the universal moment generating function approach to evaluate the different reliability or availability indices of the system. The components are characterized by having different performance levels, cost, weight, and reliability. The solution to the multi-objective multi-state problem is a set of solutions, known as the Pareto-front, from which the analyst may choose one solution for system implementation. Two illustrative examples are presented to show the performance of the algorithm; and the multi-objective formulation considered for both of them is the maximization of system availability, and the minimization of both system cost, and weight.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4454146", "xplore-issue": "4459841", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459841", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=MOMS-GA%3A+A+Multi-Objective+Multi-State+Genetic+Algorithm+for+System+Reliability+Optimization+Design+Problems&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2008&author=Heidi+A.+Taboada&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.916874&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=182&endPage=191&volumeNum=57&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "72", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Genetic algorithms", "Design optimization", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Availability", "Costs", "Reliability engineering", "Design engineering", "System performance", "Pareto analysis", "Minimization methods"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "design engineering", "genetic algorithms", "Pareto optimisation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["engineering design problems", "multiobjective multistate genetic algorithm", "system reliability optimization design", "universal moment generating function", "system availability maximization", "system cost minimization", "system weight minimization", "Pareto-front optimization"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["multi-state", "Genetic algorithms", "multi-objective optimization"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "MOMS-GA: A Multi-Objective Multi-State Genetic Algorithm for System Reliability Optimization Design Problems", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "9897136"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4459841/4454146", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "MOMS-GA: A Multi-Objective Multi-State Genetic Algorithm for System Reliability Optimization Design Problems", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Bi-objective redundancy allocation problem for a system with mixed repairable and non-repairable components", "displayText": "Hossein Zoulfaghari, Ali Zeinal Hamadani, Mostafa Abouei Ardakan, \"Bi-objective redundancy allocation problem for a system with mixed repairable and non-repairable components\", <em>ISA Transactions</em>, vol. 53, pp. 17, 2014, ISSN 00190578.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isatra.2013.08.002"}}, {"title": "Multiobjective approach developed for optimizing the dynamic behavior of incremental linear actuators", "displayText": "Professor Luc Dupr\u00e9 and Dr Guillaume Crevecoe, Imen Amdouni, Lilia El Amraoui, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gillon, Mohamed Benrejeb, Pascal Brochet, \"Multiobjective approach developed for optimizing the dynamic behavior of incremental linear actuators\", <em>COMPEL - The international journal for computation and mathematics in electrical and electronic engineering</em>, vol. 33, pp. 953, 2014, ISSN 0332-1649.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/COMPEL-06-2013-0205"}}, {"title": "Optimal Structure in Heterogeneous Multi-state Series-parallel Reliability Systems", "displayText": "Vikas K.
