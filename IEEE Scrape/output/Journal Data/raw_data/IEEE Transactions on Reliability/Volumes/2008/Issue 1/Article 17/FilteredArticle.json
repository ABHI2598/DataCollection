We propose the MCC model in 3-D meshes, and extend the corresponding routing in 2-D meshes to 3-D meshes. We consider the positions of source &amp; destination when the new faulty components are constructed. Specifically, all faulty nodes will be contained in some disjoint fault-components, and a healthy node will be included in a faulty component only if using it in the routing will definitely cause a non-minimal routing-path. A distributed process is provided to collect &amp; distribute MCC information to a limited number of nodes along so-called boundaries. Moreover, a sufficient &amp; necessary condition is provided for the existence of a Manhattan-distance-path in the presence of our faulty components. As a result, only the routing having a Manhattan-distance-path will be activated at the source, and its success can be guaranteed by using the information of boundary in routing-decisions at the intermediate nodes.
