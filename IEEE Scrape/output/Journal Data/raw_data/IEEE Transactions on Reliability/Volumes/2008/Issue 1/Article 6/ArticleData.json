However, especially for complex systems with a large number of components, and a large number of possible states, obtaining \"reliability bounds\" would be an interesting, significant issue. Reliability bounds will give us a range of the system reliability in a much shorter computation time, which allow us to make decisions more efficiently. The systems under consideration are multi-state k-out-of-n systems with i.i.d. components. We will focus on the probability of the system in states below a certain state d, denoted by Q<sub>sd</sub>. Based on the recursive algorithm proposed by Zuo &amp; Tian [14] for performance evaluation of multi-state k-out-of-n systems with i.i.d. components, a reliability bounding approach is developed in this paper. The upper, and lower bounds of Q<sub>sd</sub> are calculated by reducing the length of the k vector when using the recursive algorithm. Using the bounding approach, we can obtain a good estimate of the exact Q<sub>sd</sub> value while significantly reducing the computation time. This approach is attractive, especially to complex systems with a large number of components, and a large number of possible states. A numerical example is used to illustrate the significance of the proposed bounding approach.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4387788", "xplore-issue": "4459841", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459841", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Reliability+Bounds+for+Multi-State+%3Cformula+formulatype%3D%22inline%22%3E%3Ctex%3E%24k%24%3C%2Ftex%3E%3C%2Fformula%3E-out-of-%3Cformula+formulatype%3D%22inline%22%3E+%3Ctex%3E%24n%24%3C%2Ftex%3E%3C%2Fformula%3E+Systems&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2008&author=Zhigang+Tian&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.909766&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=53&endPage=58&volumeNum=57&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "12", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Reliability", "Upper bound", "Computer networks", "Power system modeling", "Context modeling", "Councils", "Mechanical engineering", "Manufacturing", "Research and development management", "Mechatronics"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "performance evaluation", "probability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["probability", "multi state k out of n systems", "performance evaluation", "complex systems", "system reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["recursive algorithm", "Bound", "<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex>$k$</tex></formula>-out-of-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$n$</tex> </formula> systems", "multi-state"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability Bounds for Multi-State --out-of-- Systems", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "9897137"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4459841/4387788", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability Bounds for Multi-State --out-of-- Systems", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Computing tolerance limits for the lifetime of a k-out-of-n:F system based on prior information and censored data", "displayText": "Arturo J.
