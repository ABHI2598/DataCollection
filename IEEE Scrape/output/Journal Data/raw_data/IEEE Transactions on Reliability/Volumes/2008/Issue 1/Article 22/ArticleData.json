During the past 30 years, many software reliability growth models (SRGM) have been proposed for estimating the reliability growth of software. In practice, effective debugging is not easy because the fault may not be immediately obvious. Software engineers need time to read, and analyze the collected failure data. The time delayed by the fault detection &amp; correction processes should not be negligible. Experience shows that the software debugging process can be described, and modeled using queueing system. In this paper, we will use both finite, and infinite server queueing models to predict software reliability. We will also investigate the problem of imperfect debugging, where fixing one bug creates another. Numerical examples based on two sets of real failure data are presented, and discussed in detail. Experimental results show that the proposed framework incorporating both fault detection, and correction processes for SRGM has a fairly accurate prediction capability.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4385745", "xplore-issue": "4459841", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459841", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Software+Reliability+Analysis+and+Measurement+Using+Finite+and+Infinite+Server+Queueing+Models&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2008&author=Chin-Yu+Huang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.909777&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=192&endPage=203&volumeNum=57&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "33", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Software reliability", "Software measurement", "Queueing analysis", "Fault detection", "Data engineering", "Reliability engineering", "Failure analysis", "Delay effects", "Software debugging", "Predictive models"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["software fault tolerance", "probability", "program debugging", "queueing theory"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["software debugging process", "software reliability analysis", "software reliability measurement", "finite server queueing models", "infinite server queueing models", "failure-free software operation", "probability", "software reliability growth models"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["Software testing", "Fault correction", "non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP)", "queueing theory", "software reliability growth model (SRGM)"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Software Reliability Analysis and Measurement Using Finite and Infinite Server Queueing Models", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "9905506"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4459841/4385745", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Software Reliability Analysis and Measurement Using Finite and Infinite Server Queueing Models", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Software Reliability Prediction Via Relevance Vector Regression", "displayText": "Jungang Lou, Yunliang Jiang, Qing Shen, Zhangguo Shen, Zhen Wang, Ruiqin Wang, \"Software Reliability Prediction Via Relevance Vector Regression\", <em>Neurocomputing</em>, pp. , 2016, ISSN 09252312.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2015.12.077"}}, {"title": "Software reliability analysis and assessment using queueing models with multiple change-points", "displayText": "Chin-Yu Huang, Tsui-Ying Hung, \"Software reliability analysis and assessment using queueing models with multiple change-points\", <em>Computers & Mathematics with Applications</em>, vol. 60, pp. 2015, 2010, ISSN 08981221.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.camwa.2010.07.039"}}, {"title": "Reliability growth by failure mode removal", "displayText": "Donald P.
