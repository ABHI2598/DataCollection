The proposed method exploits the existence of logic implications in a design, and is based on selective addition of pertinent functionally redundant wires to the circuit. We demonstrate that the addition of functionally redundant wires reduces the probability that a single-event transient (SET) error will reach a primary output, and, by extension, the soft error rate (SER) of the circuit. We discuss three methods for identifying candidate functionally redundant wires, and we outline the necessary conditions for adding them to the circuit. We then present an algorithm that assesses the SET sensitization probability reduction achieved by candidate functionally redundant wires, and selects an appropriate subset that, when added to the design, minimizes its SER. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits demonstrate that the proposed soft error mitigation methodology yields a significant SER reduction at the expense of commensurate hardware, power, and delay overhead."}, "references": [{"title": "Modeling the effect of technology trends\non the soft error rate of combinational logic", "context": [{"text": " Historically, soft errors have been of great concern in memories, and various mitigation solutions have been developed [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " However, technological trends such as faster clock rates, smaller device sizes, lower supply voltages, and shallower logic depths are drastically reducing SET masking, and significantly increasing the occurrence of soft errors in combinational logic [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The SER of a combinational circuit is proportional to three factors [1], [4]: the rate of SET occurrence at a logic gate \\$(R_{SET})\\$, the probability of a SET arriving at a storage element during its latching window \\$(P_{latch})\\$, and the probability of a SET propagating to an output or a storage element through a sensitized path \\$(P_{sens})\\$.", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "This paper examines the effect of technology scaling and microarchitectural trends on the rate of soft errors in CMOS memory and logic circuits.

The approximate circuits are each to generate one or more output signals based on values of received input signals. The voter circuit is to receive the one or more output signals generated by each of the approximate circuits, and is to output one or more signals corresponding to a majority value of the received signals. At least some of the approximate circuits are to generate an output value different than the reference circuit for one or more input signal values; however, for each possible input signal value, the majority values of the one or more output signals generated by the approximate circuits and received by the voter circuit correspond to output signal result values of the reference circuit.", "title": "Approximate circuits for increased reliability", "patentNumber": "9112490", "filingDate": "14 October 2013", "grantDate": "18 August 2015", "ipcClasses": ["G06F0175000000", "H03K0190030000"], "assignees": ["SANDIA CORP"], "inventors": "Hamlet, Jason R.; Mayo, Jackson R.", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US9112490.pdf", "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9112490.PN.&OS=PN/9112490"}], "lastupdate": "2016-11-15T06:08:16", "isEarlyAccess": false, "publisher": "IEEE", "title": "Soft Error Mitigation Through Selective Addition of Functionally Redundant Wires", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "9", "publicationNumber": "24", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Soft Error Mitigation Through Selective Addition of Functionally Redundant Wires", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4459841/4454143", "mlTime": "PT0.169594S", "ieeeCitationCount": "16"}}
