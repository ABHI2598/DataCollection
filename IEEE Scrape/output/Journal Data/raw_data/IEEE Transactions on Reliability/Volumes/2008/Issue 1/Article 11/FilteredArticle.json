The acyclic multi-state-arc flow-conservation network (AMAFCN) is a special multi-state-arc flow-conservation network (MAFCN) of which each arc has independent, discrete, limited multi-states (capacities), and satisfied flow conservation. The AMAFCN is arranged in such a way that no flow leaving a node can return this node through any sequence of nodes, e.g. no cycles exist. For such networks, we are interested in evaluating the AMAFCN reliability, i.e. the probability that the flow from the source node to the sink node is equal to or greater than a demanded flow of units. A general method for the MAFCN/AMAFCN reliability evaluation is using minimal path/cut vectors with system state (called the -MP/-MC). In this study, we focused on developing an extension of the universal generating function method (UGFM) to find the entire one-to-many -MP before calculating the AMAFCN reliability between the source node, and some node subset (i.e. one-to-many reliability). The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is also analyzed. Finally, one example is given to illustrate how entire one-to-many -MP are generated using the proposed algorithm. Then, all one-to-many reliabilities of this example are calculated."}, "references": [{"title": "Reliability evaluation for distributed computing networks\nwith imperfect nodes", "context": [{"text": " Multi-state network reliability analysis thus plays important roles in the network reliability of our modern society [1]\u2013[25].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "According to how the method used to transfer the flow (or signal) satisfies the flow conservation law, there are two categories of multi-state network reliability problems: the multi-state-arc flow-conservation network (MAFCN) [1]\u2013[18], and the multi-state-node flow-disconservation network (MNFDN) [19]\u2013[25].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " In MAFCN, each arc has a non-negative integer-valued random variable capacity (multi-state-arc), and all flows in the network obey the conservation law [1]\u2013[18].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Both have their own applications; for example, electrical power distribution can be modeled as MAFCN [1]\u2013[18], and computer networks or cellular telephone networks be modeled as MNFDN [19]\u2013[25].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Many methods had been developed to solve the MAFCN reliability, including the exact methods based on cut/path set [1]\u2013[16], which can calculate the exact value of reliability, and some approximate methods [17], [18], which can estimate the approximate value of network reliability, and avoid the NP-hard problem faced by the cut/path-based methods.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "This paper examines two compensating methods that: (1) account for imperfect nodes, and (2) can be embedded in most symbolic network reliability algorithms that presume perfect nodes.
