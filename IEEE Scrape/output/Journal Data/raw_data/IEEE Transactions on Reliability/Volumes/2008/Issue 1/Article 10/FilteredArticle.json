The proposed IE (called the Greedy-B&amp;B-IE) developed first a greedy procedure for reordering d-MP/d-MC to speed up the procedure in detecting &amp; deleting dominated terms. Then, a Branch-and-Bound (B&amp;B)-based technique is proposed to implement the IE to reduce the number of intersections, and decrease the number of multiplications required for calculating the probability value of each term."}, "references": [{"title": "A new simple algorithm for enumerating all minimal paths\nand cuts of a graph", "context": [{"text": " The IE also plays an important role in many areas of mathematics such as combinatorics, number theory, probability theory, and statistics [1]\u2013[9].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0026-2714(94)00121-4", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "Y.
