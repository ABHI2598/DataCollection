Replacements are carried-out at failure, if spare parts are available, and at spare parts replenishment delivery instants. Spare parts are provisioned according to an (s, Q) control policy. The ordering parameters, and preventive maintenance interval are derived from a mathematical model which aims at maximizing the system's availability under a budget constraint. The model takes into account the system lifetime distribution, the preventive and corrective maintenance costs and durations, as well as the total spare parts inventory management cost. Unlike classical inventory management models, the s-expected total cost is derived using the system lifetime distribution. Because each demand for spare parts is triggered by failure, the probabilities of shortage, and surplus will be evaluated based on the system failure distribution rather than the demand distribution during the lead-time. Numerical results have been obtained for an illustrative example.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4385744", "xplore-issue": "4459841", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459841", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=%28s%2CQ%29+Spare+Parts+Provisioning+Strategy+for+Periodically+Replaced+Systems&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2008&author=Claver+Diallo&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.909775&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=134&endPage=139&volumeNum=57&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "8", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Chromium", "Preventive maintenance", "Inventory management", "Mathematical model", "Logistics", "Transportation", "Electronic mail", "Inventory control", "Cost function", "Steady-state"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["preventive maintenance", "costing", "failure analysis", "inventory management", "mathematical analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["failure distribution", "spare parts provisioning", "periodically replaced systems", "preventive maintenance", "failure prone system", "control policy", "mathematical model", "system availability", "system lifetime distribution", "corrective maintenance", "inventory management cost"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["spare parts", "Availability", "inventory management", "joint optimization", "maintenance"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "(s,Q) Spare Parts Provisioning Strategy for Periodically Replaced Systems", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "9897127"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4459841/4385744", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "(s,Q) Spare Parts Provisioning Strategy for Periodically Replaced Systems", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Simple Stochastic Model for Planning the Inventory of Spare Components Subject to Wear-out", "displayText": "Alenka Brezav\u0161\u010dek, \"Simple Stochastic Model for Planning the Inventory of Spare Components Subject to Wear-out\", <em>Organizacija</em>, vol. 44, pp. , 2011, ISSN 1581-1832.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10051-011-0012-y"}}, {"title": "Joint optimization of spare parts ordering and maintenance policies for multiple identical items subject to silent failures", "displayText": "Sofia Panagiotidou, \"Joint optimization of spare parts ordering and maintenance policies for multiple identical items subject to silent failures\", <em>European Journal of Operational Research</em>, vol. 235, pp. 300, 2014, ISSN 03772217.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2013.10.065"}}, {"title": "JOINT MAINTENANCE AND SPARE COMPONENT PROVISIONING POLICY FOR k-OUT-OF-n SYSTEMS", "displayText": "LIANGPENG CHEN, ZHI-SHENG YE, MIN XIE, \"JOINT MAINTENANCE AND SPARE COMPONENT PROVISIONING POLICY FOR k-OUT-OF-n SYSTEMS\", <em>Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research</em>, vol. 30, pp. 1350023, 2013, ISSN 0217-5959.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0217595913500231"}}, {"title": "Joint optimal inspection and inventory for a k-out-of-n system", "displayText": "Erik T.S.
