For these systems, multiple copies of the same component type are used within the system, but only a single reliability estimate is available for each distinct component type. The variance of the reliability estimate is magnified at the system-level due to the covariance of component reliability estimates. Estimating the covariance becomes a formidable task if the system structure is complicated. A hierarchical model is proposed to decompose the system reliability estimate into component levels through intermediate layers. The decomposition procedure causes reliability estimates of duplicated components to remain <i>s</i>-independent when computing the associated variance on the adjacent upper layer. The first order Taylor series expansion is used to propagate the variance from the component level to the system level via intermediate layers. The hierarchical decomposition is preferable for designing robust, reliable systems by reducing or minimizing the system reliability variance at the component level.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4668519", "xplore-issue": "4682503", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682503", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Hierarchical+Variance+Decomposition+of+System+Reliability+Estimates+With+Duplicated+Components&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2008&author=Tongdan+Jin&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.2006643&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=564&endPage=573&volumeNum=57&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "5", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Telecommunication network reliability", "Life estimation", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Life testing", "Space vehicles", "System testing", "Taylor series", "Robustness", "Redundancy", "Preventive maintenance"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability", "covariance analysis", "decomposition", "large-scale systems"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["first order Taylor series expansion", "system reliability variance", "hierarchical variance decomposition", "duplicated components", "complex systems", "covariance", "component reliability", "intermediate layers", "s-independent"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["variance estimation", "Dependent estimates", "hierarchical decomposition", "system reliability"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Hierarchical Variance Decomposition of System Reliability Estimates With Duplicated Components", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10348683"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4682503/4668519", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Hierarchical Variance Decomposition of System Reliability Estimates With Duplicated Components", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "SA Based Software Deployment Reliability Estimation Considering Component Reliability of Exponential Distribution", "displayText": "Xihong Su, Hongwei Liu, Zhibo Wu, Xiaozong Yang, Decheng Zuo, \"SA Based Software Deployment Reliability Estimation Considering Component Reliability of Exponential Distribution\", <em>Journal of Software</em>, vol. 6, pp. , 2011, ISSN 1796-217X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4304/jsw.6.6.1140-1145"}}, {"title": "SA based software deployment reliability estimation considering component dependence", "displayText": "Xihong Su, Hongwei Liu, Zhibo Wu, Xiaozong Yang, Decheng Zuo, \"SA based software deployment reliability estimation considering component dependence\", <em>Journal of Electronics (China)</em>, vol. 28, pp. 118, 2011, ISSN 0217-9822.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11767-011-0561-5"}}], "ieee": [{"title": "A Comprehensive Approach of SA Based Software Deployment Reliability Estimation in Neural Networks", "displayText": "Xihong Su, Zhibo Wu, Hongwei Liu, Decheng Zuo, Xiaozong Yang, \"A Comprehensive Approach of SA Based Software Deployment Reliability Estimation in Neural Networks\", <em>Pervasive Computing Signal Processing and Applications (PCSPA) 2010 First International Conference on</em>, pp. 49-53, 2010.", "order": "1", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5635740", "pdfSize": "342KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5635740"}}, {"title": "Convergence analysis for maximum likelihood-based reliability estimation from subsystem and full system tests", "displayText": "James C.
