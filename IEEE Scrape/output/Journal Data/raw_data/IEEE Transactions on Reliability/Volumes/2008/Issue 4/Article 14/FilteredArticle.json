First, the safe states are categorized into three types of states, and overall systems involving safety-related systems are classified into six types of systems based on the safe-state categorization, and the completeness of trips. Next, state-transition models for the systems where the effect of SFF is the greatest are presented, and the hazardous-event rates are analysed for the systems. Then, it is found that, when the effect of the SFF constraints is positive, it is negligible; and when it is negative, it is not negligible for safety. Thus, we recommend that the application of the SFF constraints to the standard should be put on hold."}, "references": [{"title": "IEC 61508 Part 1", "context": [{"text": " This general trend forced the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to compile IEC 61508 as an epoch-making standard related to the functional safety of SRS [1]\u2013[4].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "<em>IEC 61508 Part 1</em>, Dec. 1998.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "IEC 61508 Part 2", "context": [{"text": " This general trend forced the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to compile IEC 61508 as an epoch-making standard related to the functional safety of SRS [1]\u2013[2][4].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Although the standard mandates to conform with the architectural constraint involving the SFF requirements in Tables\u00a0III and IV [2], there is no technical reason for the necessity of the SFF constraints in the standard, nor in any article so far.", "sec": "sec5a", "part": "1"}], "order": "2", "id": "ref2", "text": "<em>IEC 61508 Part 2</em>, May 2000.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "IEC 61508 Part 4", "context": [{"text": " This general trend forced the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to compile IEC 61508 as an epoch-making standard related to the functional safety of SRS [1]\u2013[3][4].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "SRS is typically composed of input devices (e.g., sensors), programmable electronics, and output devices (e.g., actuators) [3].", "sec": "sec2c", "part": "1"}, {"text": "In accordance with the standard [3], because \\$T=10^{4}[h]\\$ in these figures, if \\$\\lambda_{M}<10^{-4}[1/h]\\$, the mode of operation is categorized into the \u201clow demand mode of operation\u201d; and if \\$\\lambda_{M}\\geq 10^{-4}[1/h]\\$, it is categorized into the \u201chigh demand, or continuous mode of operation\u201d.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}], "order": "3", "id": "ref3", "text": "<em>IEC 61508 Part 4</em>, Nov. 1998.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "IEC 61508 Part 6", "context": [{"text": " This general trend forced the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to compile IEC 61508 as an epoch-making standard related to the functional safety of SRS [1]\u2013[4].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " And only dangerous failures are taken into account [4] based on those modes of operation, i.e., the low demand mode, and the high demand/continuous mode of operation [10].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Firstly, the standard usually requires us to consider common-cause failures (CCF) for multiple-channel SRS, and recommends the \\$\\beta\\$-factor model for dealing with CCF [4].", "sec": "sec5b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Generally, \\$\\beta\\$ is estimated to be 1, 5, 10, and 20% in the standard [4]; and if \\$\\beta\\$ is sufficiently great, CCF dominate system failures.", "sec": "sec5b", "part": "1"}], "order": "4", "id": "ref4", "text": "<em>IEC 61508 Part 6</em>, April 2000.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "IEC 62061", "context": [{"text": " This standard has been applied to various industrial fields [5]\u2013[8].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "5", "id": "ref5", "text": "<em>IEC 62061</em>, Jan. 2005.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Quantitative measurement on\nsafety instrumented system's performance: An approach for insuring a viability\nof another flare reduction choice", "context": [{"text": " This standard has been applied to various industrial fields [5]\u2013[6][8].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "6", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.802442.paper305", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref6", "text": "Y.
