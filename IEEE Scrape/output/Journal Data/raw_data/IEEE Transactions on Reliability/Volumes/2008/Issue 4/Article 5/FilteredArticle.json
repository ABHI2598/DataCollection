Many real-world systems are limited-flow (multi-state) networks composed of multi-state components, and their reliabilities can be computed in terms of minimal cut (MC) vectors to level <i>d</i> (named <i>d</i>-MC). A straightforward exact algorithm is presented here. The idea is to find all <i>d</i>-MC prior to calculating the limited-flow network reliability between the source, and the sink nodes (i.e. the one-to-one reliability), under the condition that all MC are known in advance. The proposed method is more efficient and effective compared to the existing algorithms in deleting the duplicate <i>d</i> -MC, verifying <i>d</i> -MC candidates, and finding the lower bounds of edge capacities in <i>d</i>-MC. The concepts of the proposed algorithm are novel, and first developed, followed by the analysis of associated computational complexities. Further, an example is provided to illustrate the generation of all <i>d</i>-MC, and verify that the obtained <i>d</i>-MC are not duplicated."}, "references": [{"title": "Network Reliability and Algebraic Structures", "context": [{"text": "Network modeling is employed to validate, verify the designs of, and evaluate the performance of many real-world systems, such as computer and communication systems, power transmission and distribution systems, transportation systems, and oil/gas production systems [1]\u2013[23].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Network reliability evaluation is \\$NP\\$-hard [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " However, locating all MC/MP, and evaluating network reliability are both shown to be #P-hard [1]; it is as hard, or even harder than NP-complete problems [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Because the number of MC can be as large as \\$2^{n-2}\\$ [1], we have Hence, the method developed from Theorem 1 is more efficient than the one from Lemma 3 for finding \\$L(e)\\$ for all \\$e\\in E\\$ [23].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "D.
