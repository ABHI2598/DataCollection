In conventional multi-state theory, it is assumed that the exact probability and performance level of each component state are given. However, it may be difficult to obtain sufficient data to estimate the precise values of these probabilities and performance levels in many highly reliable modern engineering systems. New techniques are needed to solve these fundamental problems. A general fuzzy multi-state system model is proposed in this article to overcome these deficiencies. The basic definitions and assumptions of such systems are introduced. The concepts of relevancy, coherency, and equivalence are used to characterize the properties of such systems. Future research directions include performance evaluation algorithms for the defined fuzzy multi-state systems.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4668481", "xplore-issue": "4682503", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682503", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Fuzzy+Multi-State+Systems%3A+General+Definitions%2C+and+Performance+Assessment&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2008&author=Yi+Ding&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.2006078&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=589&endPage=594&volumeNum=57&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "37", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Fuzzy systems", "Systems engineering and theory", "Reliability engineering", "Reliability theory", "System performance", "Fuzzy set theory", "Data engineering", "Set theory", "Councils", "Mechanical engineering"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "fuzzy set theory"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "fuzzy multistate systems", "binary system model", "engineering systems", "multistate theory"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["performance", "Fuzzy set theory", "multi-state system"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Fuzzy Multi-State Systems: General Definitions, and Performance Assessment", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10348677"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4682503/4668481", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Fuzzy Multi-State Systems: General Definitions, and Performance Assessment", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A modified profust-performance-reliability algorithm and its application to dynamic systems", "displayText": "Zhiyao Zhao, Quan Quan, Kai-Yuan Cai, \"A modified profust-performance-reliability algorithm and its application to dynamic systems\", <em>Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems</em>, pp. 1, 2017, ISSN 10641246.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JIFS-152544"}}, {"title": "A fuzzy-based assessment procedure for a clothing factory with waste-prevention consideration", "displayText": "Ping-Chen Chang, Yi-Kuei Lin, James C.

The reliability of the weighted-k-out-of-n:G system is the complement of the unreliability of a weighted-(w-k+1)-out-of-n:F system.
