This study developed a decision model in determining the optimal life test sampling plan with an aim of cost minimization by identifying the appropriate number of product failures in a sample that should be used as a threshold in judging the rejection of a batch. A Weibull distribution with two parameters (i.e. scale factor, and shape factor) was assumed to be appropriate for modeling the lifetime of a product, and a Bayesian decision model was thus constructed to perform the prior, preposterior, and posterior analyses. The cost structure thoroughly encompassed the considerations of rejection, acceptance, testing, and warranty costs for the adoption of an optimal sampling plan, which is capable of providing guidelines for making better decisions. Finally, a practical numerical application was employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}, "references": [{"title": "Life-testing", "context": [{"text": " Epstein & Sobel [1] proposed a life testing sampling plan with the assumption of exponentially distributed failure times by using order statistics, and type II censoring.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1953.10483488", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "B.
