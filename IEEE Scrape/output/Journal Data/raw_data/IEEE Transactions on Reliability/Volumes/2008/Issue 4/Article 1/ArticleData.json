Our approach is to mathematically model degradation-based signals from a population of components using stochastic models that combine three main sources of information: real-time degradation characteristics of component obtained by observing the component's in-situ degradation signal, the degradation characteristics of the component's population, and the real-time status of the environmental conditions under which the component is operating. Prior degradation information is used to estimate the model coefficients. The resulting generalized stochastic degradation model is then used to predict an initial residual life distribution for the component being monitored. In-situ degradation signals, along with real-time information related to the environmental conditions, are then used to update the residual life distributions in real-time. Because these updated distributions capture current health information and the latest environmental conditions, they provide precise lifetime estimates. The performance of the proposed models is evaluated using real world vibration-based degradation signals from a rotating machinery application.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4601500", "xplore-issue": "4682503", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682503", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Prognostic+Degradation+Models+for+Computing+and+Updating+Residual+Life+Distributions+in+a+Time-Varying+Environment&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2008&author=Nagi+Gebraeel&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.928245&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=539&endPage=550&volumeNum=57&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "72", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Degradation", "Distributed computing", "Mathematical model", "Stochastic processes", "Time varying systems", "Information resources", "Predictive models", "Life estimation", "Lifetime estimation", "Machinery"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["time-varying systems", "condition monitoring", "real-time systems", "stochastic systems"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["rotating machinery application", "prognostic degradation", "residual life distributions", "time-varying environment", "computing condition", "operational conditions", "degradation-based signals", "stochastic models", "real-time degradation", "environmental conditions", "health information"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["prognostics", "Condition monitoring", "degradation modeling"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Prognostic Degradation Models for Computing and Updating Residual Life Distributions in a Time-Varying Environment", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10348671"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4682503/4601500", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Prognostic Degradation Models for Computing and Updating Residual Life Distributions in a Time-Varying Environment", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Remaining Useful Life Prediction Based on the Mixed Effects Model with Mixture Prior Distribution", "displayText": "Raed Kontar, Junbo Son, Shiyu Zhou, Chaitanya Sankavaram, Yilu Zhang, Xinyu Du, \"Remaining Useful Life Prediction Based on the Mixed Effects Model with Mixture Prior Distribution\", <em>IISE Transactions</em>, pp. 0, 2016, ISSN 2472-5854.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24725854.2016.1263771"}}, {"title": "Predictive Fault Diagnosis System for Intelligent and Robust Health Monitoring", "displayText": "Stephen Oonk, Francisco J.
