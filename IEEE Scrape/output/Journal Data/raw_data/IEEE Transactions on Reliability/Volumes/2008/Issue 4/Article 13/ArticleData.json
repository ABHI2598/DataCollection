Multilevel redundancy allocation is an especially powerful approach for improving the system reliability of such hierarchical configurations, and system optimization problems that take advantage of this approach are termed multilevel redundancy allocation optimization problems (MRAOP). Despite the growing interest in MRAOP, a survey of the literature indicates that most redundancy allocation schemes are mainly confined to a single level, and few problem-specific MRAOP have been proposed or solved. The design variables in MRAOP are hierarchically structured. This paper proposes a new variable coding method in which these hierarchical design variables are represented by two types of hierarchical genotype, termed ordinal node, and terminal node. These genotypes preserve the logical linkage among the hierarchical variables, and allow every possible combination of redundancy during the optimization process. Furthermore, this paper developed a hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) that uses special genetic operators to handle the hierarchical genotype representation of hierarchical design variables. For comparison, the customized HGA, and a conventional genetic algorithm (GA) in which design variables are coded in vector forms, are applied to solve MRAOP for series systems having two different configurations. The solutions obtained when using HGA are shown to be superior to the conventional GA solutions, indicating that the HGA here is especially suitable for solving MRAOP for series systems.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4668495", "xplore-issue": "4682503", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682503", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Multilevel+Redundancy+Allocation+Optimization+Using+Hierarchical+Genetic+Algorithm&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2008&author=Ranjan+Kumar&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.2006079&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=650&endPage=661&volumeNum=57&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "20", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Genetic algorithms", "Redundancy", "Cost function", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Design optimization", "Power system reliability", "Couplings", "Hierarchical systems", "Multilevel systems", "Product design"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "genetic algorithms", "redundancy"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["hierarchical genotype", "multilevel redundancy allocation optimization", "hierarchical genetic algorithm", "hierarchical reliability system", "system reliability", "MRAOP", "variable coding method"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability optimization", "Hierarchical genetic algorithm", "hierarchical genotype", "multilevel redundancy allocation"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Multilevel Redundancy Allocation Optimization Using Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10348679"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4682503/4668495", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Multilevel Redundancy Allocation Optimization Using Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Hierarchical redundancy allocation for multi-level reliability systems employing a bacterial-inspired evolutionary algorithm", "displayText": "Tsung-Jung Hsieh, \"Hierarchical redundancy allocation for multi-level reliability systems employing a bacterial-inspired evolutionary algorithm\", <em>Information Sciences</em>, vol. 288, pp. 174, 2014, ISSN 00200255.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2014.07.055"}}, {"title": "An enhanced GA technique for system training and prognostics", "displayText": "De Z.
