First, the safe states are categorized into three types of states, and overall systems involving safety-related systems are classified into six types of systems based on the safe-state categorization, and the completeness of trips. Next, state-transition models for the systems where the effect of SFF is the greatest are presented, and the hazardous-event rates are analysed for the systems. Then, it is found that, when the effect of the SFF constraints is positive, it is negligible; and when it is negative, it is not negligible for safety. Thus, we recommend that the application of the SFF constraints to the standard should be put on hold.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4601502", "xplore-issue": "4682503", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682503", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Safety+Achieved+by+the+Safe+Failure+Fraction+%28SFF%29+in+IEC+61508&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2008&author=Itaru+Yoshimura&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.928250&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=662&endPage=669&volumeNum=57&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "10", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Safety", "IEC standards", "Fault detection", "Medical control systems", "Signal processing", "Testing", "Performance evaluation", "Machinery", "Manufacturing processes", "Transportation"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["safety", "failure analysis", "IEC standards"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["safety integrity", "safe failure fraction", "IEC 61508", "hazardous-event rates", "state-transition models"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["trip", "Functional safety", "safe failure fraction", "safe state", "safety integrity level"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Safety Achieved by the Safe Failure Fraction (SFF) in IEC 61508", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10348672"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4682503/4601502", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Safety Achieved by the Safe Failure Fraction (SFF) in IEC 61508", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "An evaluation approach using a HARA and FMEDA for the hardware SIL", "displayText": "Sung Kyu Kim, Yong Soo Kim, \"An evaluation approach using a HARA and FMEDA for the hardware SIL\", <em>Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries</em>, vol. 26, pp. 1212, 2013, ISSN 09504230.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jlp.2013.05.009"}}, {"title": "NEW RELIABILITY MEASURE FOR SAFETY INSTRUMENTED SYSTEMS", "displayText": "HUI JIN, MARY ANN LUNDTEIGEN, MARVIN RAUSAND, \"NEW RELIABILITY MEASURE FOR SAFETY INSTRUMENTED SYSTEMS\", <em>International Journal of Reliability Quality and Safety Engineering</em>, vol. 20, pp. 1350005, 2013, ISSN 0218-5393.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218539313500058"}}, {"title": "Procedure for Assessing Hardware Safety Integrity in Legacy Systems", "displayText": "Gi Young Kim, Ki Hoon Yoo, Byung Gak Ko, Joong Soon Jang, \"Procedure for Assessing Hardware Safety Integrity in Legacy Systems\", <em>Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries</em>, pp. , 2016, ISSN 09504230.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jlp.2016.01.019"}}, {"title": "Reliability assessment of safety instrumented systems subject to different demand modes", "displayText": "Yiliu Liu, Marvin Rausand, \"Reliability assessment of safety instrumented systems subject to different demand modes\", <em>Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries</em>, vol. 24, pp. 49, 2011, ISSN 09504230.", "order": "4", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jlp.2010.08.014"}}, {"title": "Sequential Series Systems and Their Risk Assessments", "displayText": "Yanyang Zhu, Aofu Zhang, Baoliang Liu, \"Sequential Series Systems and Their Risk Assessments\", <em>Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods</em>, vol. 41, pp. 3903, 2012, ISSN 0361-0926.", "order": "5", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03610926.2012.690060"}}, {"title": "An approach to operational risk modeling and estimation of safety levels for deep water work class Remotely Operated Vehicle- A case study with reference to ROSUB 6000", "displayText": "N.
