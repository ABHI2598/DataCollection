Many real-world systems are limited-flow (multi-state) networks composed of multi-state components, and their reliabilities can be computed in terms of minimal cut (MC) vectors to level <i>d</i> (named <i>d</i>-MC). A straightforward exact algorithm is presented here. The idea is to find all <i>d</i>-MC prior to calculating the limited-flow network reliability between the source, and the sink nodes (i.e. the one-to-one reliability), under the condition that all MC are known in advance. The proposed method is more efficient and effective compared to the existing algorithms in deleting the duplicate <i>d</i> -MC, verifying <i>d</i> -MC candidates, and finding the lower bounds of edge capacities in <i>d</i>-MC. The concepts of the proposed algorithm are novel, and first developed, followed by the analysis of associated computational complexities. Further, an example is provided to illustrate the generation of all <i>d</i>-MC, and verify that the obtained <i>d</i>-MC are not duplicated.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4668517", "xplore-issue": "4682503", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4682503", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+Fast+Algorithm+for+Searching+All+Multi-State+Minimal+Cuts&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2008&author=Wei-Chang+Yeh&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2008.2006293&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=581&endPage=588&volumeNum=57&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "13", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Control systems", "Computer networks", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Computational complexity", "Collaboration", "Industrial engineering", "Research and development management", "Random variables"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["computational complexities", "multistate minimal cuts", "network reliability", "limited-flow networks", "straightforward exact algorithm", "edge capacities"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["unreliable node", "<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$d$</tex></formula>-MC/MC", "limited-flow (multi-state) network", "network reliability", "perfect node"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2008", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Fast Algorithm for Searching All Multi-State Minimal Cuts", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "57", "accessionNumber": "10348682"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4682503/4668517", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Fast Algorithm for Searching All Multi-State Minimal Cuts", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "An improved algorithm for finding all upper boundary points in a stochastic-flow network", "displayText": "Majid Forghani-elahabad, Nezam Mahdavi-Amiri, \"An improved algorithm for finding all upper boundary points in a stochastic-flow network\", <em>Applied Mathematical Modelling</em>, pp. , 2015, ISSN 0307904X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2015.10.004"}}, {"title": "An efficient algorithm for evaluating logistics network reliability subject to distribution cost", "displayText": "Yi-Feng Niu, William H.K.
