Although there are many research papers on this subject, few of them address the realistic time delays between fault detection and fault correction processes. This paper investigates an approach to incorporate the time dependencies between the fault detection, and fault correction processes, focusing on the parameter estimations of the combined model. Maximum likelihood estimates of combined models are derived from an explicit likelihood formula under various time delay assumptions. Various characteristics of the combined model, like the predictive capability, are also analyzed, and compared with the traditional least squares estimation method. Furthermore, we study a direct, useful application of the proposed model &amp; estimation method to the classical optimal release time problem faced by software decision makers. The results illustrate the effect of time delay on the optimal release policy, and the overall software development cost.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4378411", "xplore-issue": "4384598", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4384598", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Modeling+and+Analysis+of+Software+Fault+Detection+and+Correction+Process+by+Considering+Time+Dependency&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2007&author=Y.+P.+Wu&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.909760&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=629&endPage=642&volumeNum=56&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "35", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Fault detection", "Delay effects", "Programming", "Software reliability", "Software testing", "Parameter estimation", "Maximum likelihood detection", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Delay estimation", "Predictive models"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["software reliability", "least squares approximations", "maximum likelihood estimation", "program testing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["software decision makers", "software fault detection", "software fault correction process", "time dependency", "software reliability modeling", "software reliability estimation", "software development", "software testing", "maximum likelihood estimates", "time delay assumptions", "least squares estimation method"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["software reliability", "Delay time modeling", "fault correction", "fault detection", "maximum likelihood estimation", "non-homogeneous Poisson process", "parameter estimation"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Modeling and Analysis of Software Fault Detection and Correction Process by Considering Time Dependency", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9747850"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4384598/4378411", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Modeling and Analysis of Software Fault Detection and Correction Process by Considering Time Dependency", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Enhancing software reliability modeling and prediction through the introduction of time-variable fault reduction factor", "displayText": "Chao-Jung Hsu, Chin-Yu Huang, Jun-Ru Chang, \"Enhancing software reliability modeling and prediction through the introduction of time-variable fault reduction factor\", <em>Applied Mathematical Modelling</em>, vol. 35, pp. 506, 2011, ISSN 0307904X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2010.07.017"}}, {"title": "Testing effort dependent software reliability model for imperfect debugging process considering both detection and correction", "displayText": "R.
