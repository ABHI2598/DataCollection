This paper investigates an approach to incorporate the time dependencies between the fault detection, and fault correction processes, focusing on the parameter estimations of the combined model. Maximum likelihood estimates of combined models are derived from an explicit likelihood formula under various time delay assumptions. Various characteristics of the combined model, like the predictive capability, are also analyzed, and compared with the traditional least squares estimation method. Furthermore, we study a direct, useful application of the proposed model &amp; estimation method to the classical optimal release time problem faced by software decision makers.
