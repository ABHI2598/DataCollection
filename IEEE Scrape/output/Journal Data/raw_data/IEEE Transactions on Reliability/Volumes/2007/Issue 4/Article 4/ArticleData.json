However, it is a nontrivial, error-prone, arduous, and time-consuming task even for experienced system administrators, and statistical analysts to know what a reasonable set of steps should include to model, and successfully predict performance variables, or system failures of a complex software system. Reported results are fragmented, and focus on applying statistical regression techniques to monitored numerical system data. In this paper, we propose a best practice guide for building empirical models based on our experience with forecasting Apache web server performance variables, and forecasting call availability of a real-world telecommunication system. To substantiate the presented guide, and to demonstrate our approach in a step by step manner, we model, and predict the response time, and the amount of free physical memory of an Apache web server system, as well as the call availability of an industrial telecommunication system. Additionally, we present concrete results for a) variable selection where we cross benchmark three procedures, b) empirical model building where we cross benchmark four techniques, and c) sensitivity analysis. This best practice guide intends to assist in configuring modeling approaches systematically for best estimation, and prediction results.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4378407", "xplore-issue": "4384598", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4384598", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+Best+Practice+Guide+to+Resource+Forecasting+for+Computing+Systems&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2007&author=Guenther+A.+Hoffmann&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.909764&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=615&endPage=628&volumeNum=56&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "27", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Best practices", "Predictive models", "Software systems", "Availability", "Web server", "Software measurement", "Aging", "Fault tolerant systems", "Failure analysis", "Performance analysis"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["software reliability", "fault tolerant computing", "file servers", "Internet", "large-scale systems", "regression analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["industrial telecommunication system", "resource forecasting", "computing systems", "measurement-based studies", "software systems", "system availability", "system reliability", "fault tolerance", "system administrators", "statistical analysts", "complex software system", "statistical regression techniques", "empirical models", "Apache Web server performance", "real-world telecommunication system"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["telecommunication systems", "Apache web server", "failure forecasting", "monitoring", "non-parametric modeling", "prediction of resource utilization", "quantitative analysis", "statistical modeling"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Best Practice Guide to Resource Forecasting for Computing Systems", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9747846"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4384598/4378407", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Best Practice Guide to Resource Forecasting for Computing Systems", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering", "displayText": "Gergely J\u00e1nos Paljak, Imre Kocsis, Zolt\u00e1n \u00c9gel, D\u00e1niel T\u00f3th, Andr\u00e1s Pataricza, <em>Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering</em>, vol. 23, pp. 130, 2010, ISSN 1867-8211, ISBN 978-3-642-11481-6.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-11482-3_9"}}, {"title": "Rejoinder to reviewers\u2019 comments on \u2018system availability assessment using stochastic models\u2019", "displayText": "Kishor S.
