It has not only utilized critical areas of the computer system to survive reboots, but also grown resilient against current anti-spyware tools; they are capable of self-healing themselves against deletion. Because existing anti-spyware tools are stateless in the sense that they do not remember or monitor the spyware programs that were deleted, they fail to remove self-healing spyware from the system completely. This paper proposes a stateful approach that is based on characterizing spyware invasion as a trust information flow problem, and implements STARS (stateful threat-aware removal system), which is a tool that at run time monitors critical system behaviors, and ensures that removed spyware programs do not reinstall themselves, to enforce information flow policy in the system. If a reinstallation (self-healing) is detected, STARS infers the source of such activities, and discovers additional ldquosuspiciousrdquo programs. Experimental results show that STARS is effective in removing self-healing spyware programs that resist removal by existing anti-spyware tools."}, "references": [{"title": "Technically speaking: The spyware nightmare", "context": [{"text": "Spyware is a new type of potentially unwanted programs (PUP) [1] the goal of which is to monitor users' online behaviors without user consent.", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/1491233", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1491233", "pdfSize": "290KB"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "P.
