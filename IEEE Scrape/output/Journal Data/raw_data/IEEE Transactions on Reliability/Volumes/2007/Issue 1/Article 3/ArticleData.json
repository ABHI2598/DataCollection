System reliability, and system unreliability are two related performance indices useful to measure the quality level of a supply-demand system. For a binary-state network without flow, the system unreliability is the probability that the system can not connect the source and the sink. Extending to a limited-flow network in the single-commodity case, the arc capacity is stochastic, and the system capacity (i.e. the maximum flow) is not a fixed number. The system unreliability for (d+1), the probability that the upper bound of the system capacity equals d, can be computed in terms of upper boundary points. An upper boundary point is the maximal system state such that the system fulfills the demand. This paper concentrates on a multicommodity limited-flow network (MLFN) in which multicommodity are transmitted through unreliable nodes and arcs. Nevertheless, the system capacity is not suitable to be treated as the maximal sum of the commodity because each commodity consumes the capacity differently. We define the system capacity as a demand vector if the system fulfills at most such a demand vector. The main problem of this paper is to measure the quality level of a MLFN. We propose a new performance index, the probability that the upper bound of the system capacity equals the demand vector subject to the budget constraint, to evaluate the quality level of a MLFN. A branch-and-bound algorithm based on minimal cuts is presented to generate all upper boundary points in order to compute the performance index. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4118438", "xplore-issue": "4118420", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118420", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=System+Reliability+of+a+Limited-Flow+Network+in+Multicommodity+Case&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2007&author=Yi-Kuei+Lin&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.884593&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=17&endPage=25&volumeNum=56&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "2", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Reliability", "Costs", "Upper bound", "Capacity planning", "Performance analysis", "Stochastic systems", "Computational complexity", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Councils", "Information management"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["vectors", "computational complexity", "performance index", "probability", "reliability theory", "stochastic processes", "supply and demand", "tree searching"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["computational complexity", "system reliability", "supply-demand system", "binary-state network", "system unreliability", "single-commodity case", "multicommodity limited-flow network", "system capacity", "demand vector", "probability", "budget constraint", "branch-and-bound algorithm"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["unreliable nodes", "Budget constraint", "limited-flow networks", "multicommodity", "quality level", "reliability"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "System Reliability of a Limited-Flow Network in Multicommodity Case", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9347246"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4118420/4118438", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "System Reliability of a Limited-Flow Network in Multicommodity Case", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A method to evaluate routing policy through p minimal paths for stochastic case", "displayText": "Yi-Kuei Lin, \"A method to evaluate routing policy through p minimal paths for stochastic case\", <em>Information Sciences</em>, vol. 180, pp. 4595, 2010, ISSN 00200255.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2010.07.036"}}], "ieee": [{"title": "Algorithm and program for calculating the structural reliability of the NGN network using method of statistic modeling", "displayText": "Alevtina A.

This paper concentrates on a stochastic-flow network in which nodes as well as branches have several possible capacities, and can fail. The possibility is evaluated that a given amount of messages can be transmitted through the stochastic-flow network under the budget constraint. Such a possibility, system reliability, is a performance index for a stochastic-flow network.
