The IPC introduces multimode failures that must be considered in the accurate reliability analysis of PMS. Another difficulty in analysis is to allow for multiple CCF that can affect different subsets of system components, and which can occur s-dependently. Our methodology for resolving the above difficulties is to separate the consideration of both IPC and CCF from the combinatorics of the binary decision diagram-based solution, and adjust the input and output of the program to generate the reliability of PMS with IPC and CCF. According to the separation order, two equivalent approaches are developed. The applications and advantages of the approaches are illustrated through examples.
