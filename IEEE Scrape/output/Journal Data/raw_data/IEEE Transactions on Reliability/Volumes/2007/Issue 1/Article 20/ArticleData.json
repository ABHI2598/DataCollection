To achieve the desired reliability and availability levels, it is necessary to carry out costly maintenance activity on the cylinder liners, the wear on which is a major factor in causing diesel engine failure. This paper presents a s-based methodology that can be used to carry out a condition-based estimate of liner reliability with respect to failure through excessive wear, and to plan condition-based maintenance activity. The wear process is described through an ad hoc cumulative damage model, and the reliability of the liners is estimated on the basis of wear measures, and predictions of wear increase. The approach proposed allows reducing maintenance costs without noticeably affecting liner reliability. In fact, it gives the probability of inspecting or replacing liners only when there is a high likelihood that their wear level will exceed the wear limit before the next inspection date. The proposed model, and planning procedure have been applied to a data set consisting of wear measures of the cylinder liners of two SULZER RTA 58 engines equipping twin ships of the Grimaldi Group", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4118430", "xplore-issue": "4118420", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118420", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+Wear+Model+for+Assessing+the+Reliability+of+Cylinder+Liners+in+Marine+Diesel+Engines&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2007&author=Massimiliano+Giorgio&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.890901&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=158&endPage=166&volumeNum=56&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "10", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Engine cylinders", "Diesel engines", "Maintenance", "Inspection", "Availability", "Costs", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Warranties", "Predictive models", "Marine vehicles"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["wear", "diesel engines", "maintenance engineering", "reliability", "ships"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability assessment", "cylinder liner reliability", "marine diesel engines", "costing", "condition-based maintenance activity", "s-based methodology", "cylinder liner wear process", "ad hoc cumulative damage model", "probability", "SULZER RTA 85 engine", "Grimaldi group"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability assessment", "Condition-based maintenance", "cumulative damage model", "cylinder liner wear", "marine diesel engine", "power law process"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Wear Model for Assessing the Reliability of Cylinder Liners in Marine Diesel Engines", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9347263"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4118420/4118430", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Wear Model for Assessing the Reliability of Cylinder Liners in Marine Diesel Engines", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Multiscale Modeling of Wear Degradation in Cylinder Liners", "displayText": "Alvaro Moraes, Fabrizio Ruggeri, Ra\u00fal Tempone, Pedro Vilanova, \"Multiscale Modeling of Wear Degradation in Cylinder Liners\", <em>Multiscale Modeling & Simulation</em>, vol. 12, pp. 396, 2014, ISSN 1540-3459.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/130927024"}}, {"title": "Analysis of dynamic effects relevant for the wear damage in hydraulic machines for wave energy conversion", "displayText": "Limin Yang, J\u00f8rgen Hals, Torgeir Moan, \"Analysis of dynamic effects relevant for the wear damage in hydraulic machines for wave energy conversion\", <em>Ocean Engineering</em>, vol. 37, pp. 1089, 2010, ISSN 00298018.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2010.04.005"}}, {"title": "A condition-based maintenance policy for deteriorating units.
