In a single-commodity stochastic-flow network (branches all have several possible capacities, and may fail), the system reliability, the probability that the maximum flow is larger than or equal to a given demand, is an important performance index to measure the quality level of a network. In a two-commodity stochastic-flow network, different types of commodities are transmitted through the same network simultaneously, and compete for the capacities. We concentrate on the reliability problem for such a network subject to the budget constraint. This paper defines firstly the system capacity as a pattern. We propose a performance index, the probability that the system capacity is less than or equal to a given pattern subject to the budget constraint, to evaluate the system performance. A simple algorithm based on minimal cuts is proposed to generate all maximal vectors meeting the demand and budget constraints. The performance index can then be computed in terms of all such maximal vectors", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4118437", "xplore-issue": "4118420", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118420", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Reliability+of+a+Flow+Network+Subject+to+%3Cnewline%2F%3EBudget+Constraints&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2007&author=Yi-Kuei+Lin&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.884594&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=10&endPage=16&volumeNum=56&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "2", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Capacity planning", "Performance analysis", "Reliability", "Transmission lines", "System performance", "Costs", "Fluid flow measurement", "Councils", "Information management", "Cities and towns"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["vectors", "performance index", "probability", "reliability theory", "stochastic processes", "transportation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["vectors", "budget constraints", "system capacity", "deterministic flow network", "single-commodity stochastic-flow network", "system reliability", "probability", "performance index", "two-commodity stochastic-flow network"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["two-commodity", "Budget", "capacity vectors", "minimal cuts", "performance index", "reliability"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability of a Flow Network Subject to <newline/>Budget Constraints", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9347245"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4118420/4118437", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability of a Flow Network Subject to <newline/>Budget Constraints", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"title": "Analysis for application reliability parameters of communication networks", "displayText": "Shuo Li, Ning Huang, Jiaxi Chen, Rui Kang, \"Analysis for application reliability parameters of communication networks\", <em>Quality Reliability Risk Maintenance and Safety Engineering (ICQR2MSE) 2012 International Conference on</em>, pp. 206-210, 2012.", "order": "1", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6246220", "pdfSize": "1831KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/6246220"}}, {"title": "A new method for evaluating the performance reliability of communications network", "displayText": "Xuewang Wang, Ning Huang, Weiwei Chen, Ruiying Li, \"A new method for evaluating the performance reliability of communications network\", <em>Information Networking and Automation (ICINA) 2010 International Conference on</em>, vol. 2, pp. V2-516-V2-520, 2010.", "order": "2", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5636457", "pdfSize": "921KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/5636457"}}]}, "mlTime": "PT0.052085S", "title": "Reliability of a Flow Network Subject to <newline/>Budget Constraints", "lastupdate": "2016-11-12T01:55:51", "ieeeCitationCount": "2", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0"}, "references": [{"id": "ref1", "refType": "biblio", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0360-8352(98)00111-9"}, "context": [{"sec": "sec3", "part": "1", "text": " All MC can be efficiently derived from the algorithms discussed in [1], [4], [18]."}], "title": "A heuristic technique for generating minimal\npaths and cutsets of a general network", "order": "1", "text": "A.

Nodes as well as branches can have limited capacities and can fail. The method builds a branching tree. The tree-nodes are the disjoint terms of a symbolic reliability expression. The paper shows how to find the probability function and mean of the network performance. The method is both simple and effective. The minimal paths or cutsets are not needed explicitly.
