This sample size determination is very important because the reliability of the sampled vehicles should represent the reliability of the entire fleet. Smaller-than-required sample sizes may lead to an incorrect representation of the reliability of the fleet, which may mislead the Army to make poor decisions, such as deploying a fleet that may not be reliable. These type II errors can be minimized by incorporating a more realistic sampling methodology, as developed in this research. Prior to using this methodology, analytical formulas were used to compute reliability sample sizes with unit-to-unit variation assumed to be constant. This new methodology confirms the analytically derived solutions for fixed usage &amp; true failure rate, as well as for fixed usage &amp; varying vehicle true failure rate. Existing reliability data shows that unit-to-unit variation does exist. Vehicle variation in true failure rate is modeled with a Gamma prior distribution. Recent reliability data are used to validate the hypothesis that this is an adequate tool for reliability sampling when unit-to-unit variation exists. Results of this validation accept the hypothesis, validating that the methodology is an adequate tool. The Army is currently using this methodology for fleet assessment", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4118439", "xplore-issue": "4118420", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118420", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Reliability+Sampling+Methodology+Using+Simulation+and+Re-Sampling&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2007&author=John+Nierwinski&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.884598&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=125&endPage=131&volumeNum=56&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "4", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Sampling methods", "Analytical models", "Military computing", "Failure analysis", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Land vehicles", "Road vehicles", "Random variables", "Probability distribution", "Shape"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["sampling methods", "failure analysis", "military vehicles", "reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["fleet assessment", "reliability sampling methodology", "simulation", "sample size determination", "sampled vehicles", "fleet reliability", "vehicles", "analytical formula", "failure rate", "gamma prior distribution", "unit-to-unit variation"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["unit-to-unit variation", "Gamma prior distribution", "reliability sampling", "re-sampling", "simulation"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability Sampling Methodology Using Simulation and Re-Sampling", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9347259"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4118420/4118439", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability Sampling Methodology Using Simulation and Re-Sampling", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Optimal sampling plan for clean development mechanism lighting projects with lamp population decay", "displayText": "Xianming Ye, Xiaohua Xia, Jiangfeng Zhang, \"Optimal sampling plan for clean development mechanism lighting projects with lamp population decay\", <em>Applied Energy</em>, vol. 136, pp. 1184, 2014, ISSN 03062619.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.056"}}, {"title": "Optimal sampling plan for clean development mechanism energy efficiency lighting projects", "displayText": "Xianming Ye, Xiaohua Xia, Jiangfeng Zhang, \"Optimal sampling plan for clean development mechanism energy efficiency lighting projects\", <em>Applied Energy</em>, vol. 112, pp. 1006, 2013, ISSN 03062619.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.05.064"}}], "ieee": [{"title": "Optimal metering plan of measurement and verification for energy efficiency lighting projects", "displayText": "X.
