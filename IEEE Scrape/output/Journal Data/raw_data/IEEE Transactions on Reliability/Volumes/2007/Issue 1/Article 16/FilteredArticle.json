This sample size determination is very important because the reliability of the sampled vehicles should represent the reliability of the entire fleet. Smaller-than-required sample sizes may lead to an incorrect representation of the reliability of the fleet, which may mislead the Army to make poor decisions, such as deploying a fleet that may not be reliable. These type II errors can be minimized by incorporating a more realistic sampling methodology, as developed in this research. Prior to using this methodology, analytical formulas were used to compute reliability sample sizes with unit-to-unit variation assumed to be constant. This new methodology confirms the analytically derived solutions for fixed usage &amp; true failure rate, as well as for fixed usage &amp; varying vehicle true failure rate. Existing reliability data shows that unit-to-unit variation does exist. Vehicle variation in true failure rate is modeled with a Gamma prior distribution. Recent reliability data are used to validate the hypothesis that this is an adequate tool for reliability sampling when unit-to-unit variation exists. Results of this validation accept the hypothesis, validating that the methodology is an adequate tool. The Army is currently using this methodology for fleet assessment"}, "references": [{"title": "Supporting\nefforts critical to the army's transformation <ref_formula><tex>$\\ldots$</tex>\n</ref_formula>recapitalization and unit set fielding", "context": [{"text": " RECAP is a program that rebuilds and/or upgrades systems to like-new condition [1]. \u201cSystem\u201d refers to the type of vehicle (e.g. tank, m88, etc.).", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "LTG P.
