We propose two indices to compare reliability. The comparison is also distribution-free; i.e., it does not require the assumption on the lifetime distributions. A comparability index that is derived by integrating the weighted difference between the reliability functions of the two groups under comparison is named the \"Better or Worse\" (BOW) index. The second comparability index that is derived by calculating the overlapping area under the two distributions in comparison is named \"Reliability Comparability\" (RC) to quantify the degree of similarity between the two distributions. These two new indices are compared with the conventional methods currently used in the IC industries. Practical applications in lifetime-type reliability comparison are also illustrated in this paper"}, "references": [{"title": "Proceedings of Hawaii International Conference on Statistics 2002", "context": [{"text": " To compare process parameters, Wang [1] proposed an index, \u201csameness\u201d (whose corresponding US patent was filed and granted in 2004 [2]), in 2002, and he defined \u201csameness\u201d as the \u201cnormalized\u201d sum of the integral (both shaded areas in Fig.\u00a01) under both distributions from a predetermined lower limit \u201cC\u201d to upper limit \u201cD\u201d as in Fig.\u00a01, where \u201cC\u201d is the lower \\$3\\sigma\\$ control limit of one population (Fab A in Fig.\u00a01), and \u201cD\u201d is the upper \\$3\\sigma\\$ control limit of the other (Fab B in Fig.\u00a01).", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Sameness makes quantitative comparisons possible, and, to further facilitate management reviews, a color scheme shown in Fig.\u00a02 is defined [1], [2] below due to the many WAT parameters to be compared:\n\na)\nGreen (\\$\\rightarrow\\$ good matching): \\${\\rm sameness}\\geq 98\\%\\$\n\nb)\nYellow (\\$\\rightarrow\\$ medium matching): \\$90\\%\\leq{\\rm sameness}<98\\%\\$\n\nc)\nRed (\\$\\rightarrow\\$ poor matching): \\${\\rm sameness}<90\\%\\$\n\n\n\nFig. 1.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "E.
