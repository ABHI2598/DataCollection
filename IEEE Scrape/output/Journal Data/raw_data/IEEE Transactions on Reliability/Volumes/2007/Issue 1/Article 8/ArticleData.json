The IPC introduces multimode failures that must be considered in the accurate reliability analysis of PMS. Another difficulty in analysis is to allow for multiple CCF that can affect different subsets of system components, and which can occur s-dependently. Our methodology for resolving the above difficulties is to separate the consideration of both IPC and CCF from the combinatorics of the binary decision diagram-based solution, and adjust the input and output of the program to generate the reliability of PMS with IPC and CCF. According to the separation order, two equivalent approaches are developed. The applications and advantages of the approaches are illustrated through examples. PMS without IPC and/or CCF appear as special cases of the approaches", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "false", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4118452", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118420", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Reliability+Evaluation+of+Phased-Mission+Systems+With+Imperfect+Fault+Coverage+and+Common-Cause+Failures&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2007&author=Liudong+Xing&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.890900&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=58&endPage=68&volumeNum=56&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "65", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Data structures", "Boolean functions", "Binary decision diagrams", "Phased arrays", "Aerodynamics", "Failure analysis", "Combinatorial mathematics", "Fault trees", "Data handling", "Receiving antennas"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "binary decision diagrams", "fault trees", "probability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["fault tree", "phased-mission system reliability evaluation", "imperfect fault coverage", "common-cause failure", "binary decision diagram-based solution"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["phased-mission reliability", "Binary decision diagram", "common-cause failure", "fault tree", "imperfect fault coverage"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability Evaluation of Phased-Mission Systems With Imperfect Fault Coverage and Common-Cause Failures", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9347251"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/ielx5/24/4118420/4118452/html/img", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability Evaluation of Phased-Mission Systems With Imperfect Fault Coverage and Common-Cause Failures", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Binary Decision Diagrams and Extensions for System Reliability Analysis", "displayText": "pp. 187, 2015, ISBN 9781119178026.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781119178026.refs"}}, {"title": "Optimal elements separation in non-repairable phased-mission systems", "displayText": "Gregory Levitin, Liudong Xing, Suprasad V.
