We strive to continue this reputation, so we continue to discover what makes journals great. We have discovered that IEEE journals work to have the qualities readers and authors would like to expect. Correctness and technical merit are important features of accepted manuscripts, with correctness rating as most important to the responding editors. Writing and solving real problems seem to be the least important features. The relative unimportance of these last two categories may be a concern, except that relative importance is not an indicator of absolute importance. However, a recent IEEE survey suggests that members place most value on more practical articles, which suggests that the relative importance of solving real problems should be high if we are to meet the needs of our members through our journals.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4118446", "xplore-issue": "4118420", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118420", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Editorial%26mdash%3BIEEE+Editors+Survey+on+the+Features+of+Accepted+Papers&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2007&author=Jason+Rupe&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.893232&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=2&endPage=9&volumeNum=56&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "0", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["publishing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["technical merit", "IEEE editors survey", "accepted papers", "correctness"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Editorial&mdash;IEEE Editors Survey on the Features of Accepted Papers", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9892762"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4118420/4118446", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Editorial&mdash;IEEE Editors Survey on the Features of Accepted Papers", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {}, "mlTime": "PT0.02373S", "title": "Editorial&mdash;IEEE Editors Survey on the Features of Accepted Papers", "lastupdate": "2016-08-04T20:42:10", "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0"}, "references": [{"id": "ref1", "refType": "biblio", "context": [{"sec": "sec6", "part": "1", "text": " This is surprising because recent feedback from IEEE members [1] suggests that they place higher importance on applied material.11\nQuestion 5 of the 2005 IEEE Member Needs Survey of Regions 1\u201310 Members, Senior Members, and Fellows presented 19 initiatives; and the most frequently selected initiative was the choice \u201cmore practical articles\u201d."}, {"sec": "sec7", "part": "1", "text": " And if we interpret Academic as being the opposite of practical, we at least place low value on the kinds of papers which members seem to not value [1].2 But Academic could also be interpreted as scientific or technical, which would be good qualities."}, {"sec": "sec10", "part": "1", "text": "Solving applied problems is least important, which goes against what IEEE members indicate is important to them [1].33\nSee footnote 1."}], "title": "Strategic research and planning,", "order": "1", "text": "<em>Strategic research and planning</em>, Dec. 2005."}], "arnumber": "4118446"}
