When a system has a number of copies for analysis, the usual approach is to assume homogeneity among all system copies, and then to pool data from these copies. In the real world, however, it may be more reasonable to assume heterogeneity among the system copies. Therefore, this paper proposes a new generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), called PLP-GLMM, to analyse failure data from multi-copy repairable systems. In the PLP-GLMM, the underlying model for each system copy is assumed to be a PLP at Stage 1, and parameters vary among copies at Stage 2. The PLP-GLMM can make inferences about both the population, and each system copy when accounting for copy-to-copy variance. A modified Anderson-Darling test is adapted to the goodness-of-fit test of the PLP-GLMM. A numerical application is given to show the effectiveness of the model", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4118450", "xplore-issue": "4118420", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118420", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Generalized+Linear+Mixed+Models+for+Reliability+Analysis+of+Multi-Copy+Repairable+Systems&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2007&author=Furong+Tan&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2006.884596&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=106&endPage=114&volumeNum=56&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "7", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Power system modeling", "Shape measurement", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Error analysis", "Density measurement", "Time measurement", "Vectors", "Power system reliability", "Failure analysis", "Testing"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["statistical testing", "maximum likelihood estimation", "reliability theory"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["maximum likelihood estimation", "generalized linear mixed model", "reliability analysis", "multicopy repairable system", "power law process", "Anderson-Darling test", "goodness-of-fit test"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["the power law process", "Empirical Bayes estimate", "generalized linear mixed models", "maximum likelihood estimation", "multi-copy repairable system", "reliability analysis"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Generalized Linear Mixed Models for Reliability Analysis of Multi-Copy Repairable Systems", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9347257"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4118420/4118450", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Generalized Linear Mixed Models for Reliability Analysis of Multi-Copy Repairable Systems", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Generalized Confidence Interval for the Scale Parameter of the Power-Law Process", "displayText": "Bing Xing Wang, Min Xie, Jun Xing Zhou, \"Generalized Confidence Interval for the Scale Parameter of the Power-Law Process\", <em>Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods</em>, vol. 42, pp. 898, 2013, ISSN 0361-0926.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03610926.2011.588363"}}, {"title": "A prognostics-based spare part ordering and system replacement policy for a deteriorating system subjected to a random lead time", "displayText": "Zhaoqiang Wang, Changhua Hu, Wenbin Wang, Xiangyu Kong, Wei Zhang, \"A prognostics-based spare part ordering and system replacement policy for a deteriorating system subjected to a random lead time\", <em>International Journal of Production Research</em>, pp. 1, 2014, ISSN 0020-7543.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2014.988892"}}, {"title": "Analysis of field failure data when modeled Weibull slope increases with time", "displayText": "Daniel R.
