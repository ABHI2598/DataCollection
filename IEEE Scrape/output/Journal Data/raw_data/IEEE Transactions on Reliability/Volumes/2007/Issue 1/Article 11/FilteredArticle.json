It is assumed that the failure modes have respective latent (unobservable) failure times, and the minimum of these times corresponds to the product lifetime. The latent failure times are assumed to be s-independently distributed Weibull with known, common shape parameter. Expressions for the Fisher information matrix, and test plan criteria are presented. The methodology is applied to the ALT of Class-H insulation for motorettes, where temperature is the accelerating factor. Two-level, and 4:2:1 allocation test plans based on determinants, and on estimating quantiles or hazard functions, are presented. Sensitivity of optimal test plans to the specified Weibull shape parameter is also studied"}, "references": [{"title": "Accelerated Testing: Statistical Models, Test Plans, and Data Analyses", "context": [{"text": " Examples of products that fail due to two or more failure modes are given in Chapter 7 of [1], and in [2].", "sec": "sec1b1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Chapter 7 of [1] discusses methods for analyzing ALT data in the presence of competing risks.", "sec": "sec1b2", "part": "1"}, {"text": " See also [1], and [16].", "sec": "sec1b3", "part": "1"}, {"text": "On page 400 of [1], the author remarks that in the presence of competing risks, life percentile curves tend to be concave downward, instead of linear, on traditional probability plots.", "sec": "sec1b3", "part": "1"}, {"text": "[1], on page 393, described data from accelerated life tests of the Class-H insulation system of motorettes at \\${\\tt temp}=190\\$, 220, 240, and \\$260^{\\circ}{\\rm C}\\$.", "sec": "sec7", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Data from \\$260^{\\circ}{\\rm C}\\$ are excluded because model fits in [1] revealed difficulties with data at \\$260^{\\circ}{\\rm C}\\$.", "sec": "sec7", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "W.
