The model takes into account the defense strategy that presumes separation and protection of system elements. The defense strategy optimization methodology is suggested, based on the assumption that the attacker tries to maximize the expected damage of an attack. An optimization algorithm is presented that uses a universal generating function technique for evaluating the losses caused by system performance reduction, and a genetic algorithm for determining the optimal defense strategy.
