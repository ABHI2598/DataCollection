In statistical terminology, such accelerated testing carries a risk of confounding. For linear models, there is theory which allows one to determine which models are confounded with others. This paper develops analogous theory for a simple kind of confounding model, evanescent processes, when kinetics is used as the basis of modeling accelerated testing. A heuristic for identifying simple evanescent processes that can give rise to disruptive alternatives (alternative models that reverse the decision which would be made based on modeling to date) is outlined. Then, we develop activity mapping, a tool for quantitatively identifying the parameter values of that evanescent process which can result in disruptive alternatives. Finally, we see how activity mapping can be used to identify experiments which help reveal such disruptive evanescent processes", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4220792", "xplore-issue": "4220773", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220773", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Identifying+Mechanisms+That+Highly+Accelerated+Tests+Miss&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2007&author=Michael+J.+LuValle&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.896682&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=349&endPage=359&volumeNum=56&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "8", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Life estimation", "Stress", "Temperature", "Kinetic theory", "Optical fiber testing", "Materials reliability", "Terminology", "Extrapolation", "Kelvin", "Entropy"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["statistical analysis", "life testing", "parameter estimation", "reliability", "risk analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["evanescent process", "accelerated testing", "reliability", "confounding risk model", "statistical analysis", "activity mapping", "parameter identification"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["kinetics", "Accelerated testing", "confounding", "experiment design", "extrapolation error"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Identifying Mechanisms That Highly Accelerated Tests Miss", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9501644"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4220773/4220792", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Identifying Mechanisms That Highly Accelerated Tests Miss", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Challenges in Qualitative Accelerated Testing of WSN Hardware", "displayText": "Johanna Virkki, Liquan Chen, Yao Zhu, Yuewei Meng, \"Challenges in Qualitative Accelerated Testing of WSN Hardware\", <em>Engineering</em>, vol. 03, pp. 1234, 2011, ISSN 1947-3931.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/eng.2011.312153"}}, {"title": "An approach that can quickly assess product reliability", "displayText": "J.
