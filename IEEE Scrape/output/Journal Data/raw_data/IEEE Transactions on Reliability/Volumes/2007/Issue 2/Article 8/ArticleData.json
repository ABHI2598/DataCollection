Customers' availability requirements are met by adjusting the availability of the protection paths with different sharing options. Information required for calculating the availability of both the working, and protection paths can be collected along the specific working, and protection paths, thus avoiding the requirement for flooding. This makes our algorithms scalable for a large network. Our algorithms work consistently against both single, and multiple failures. Furthermore, we propose extensions for the existing signaling protocols to demonstrate that our proposed algorithms require minimum changes to the existing protocols. Simulation results show that our proposal performs better than the conventional Dedicated Path Protection schemes in terms of Call Acceptance Rate, and Total Bandwidth Consumption. Finally, by comparing simulation results to analytical results for a simplified network, we provide some insights into the correctness, and efficiency of our proposed algorithms", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4220777", "xplore-issue": "4220773", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220773", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+Scalable+Path+Protection+Mechanism+for+Guaranteed+Network+Reliability+Under+Multiple+Failures&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2007&author=Changcheng+Huang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.896739&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=254&endPage=267&volumeNum=56&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "18", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Protection", "Bandwidth", "Probability", "Availability", "Protocols", "Resource management", "Quality of service", "Systems engineering and theory", "Floods", "Proposals"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["telecommunication network reliability", "failure analysis", "multiprotocol label switching", "probability", "signalling protocols"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["total bandwidth consumption", "scalable path protection mechanism", "guaranteed network reliability", "link failure probability", "backup resource sharing algorithms", "LFP based first-fit algorithm", "LFP based best-fit algorithm", "generalized multi-protocol label switching networks", "GMPLS networks", "protection paths availability", "signaling protocols", "multiple failures", "call acceptance rate"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["protection", "Availability", "GMPLS", "network"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Scalable Path Protection Mechanism for Guaranteed Network Reliability Under Multiple Failures", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9501634"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4220773/4220777", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Scalable Path Protection Mechanism for Guaranteed Network Reliability Under Multiple Failures", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Optimal Capacity Provisioning for Survivable Next Generation Ethernet Transport Networks", "displayText": "Mohammad Nurujjaman, Samir Sebbah, Chadi Assi, Martin Maier, \"Optimal Capacity Provisioning for Survivable Next Generation Ethernet Transport Networks\", <em>Journal of Optical Communications and Networking</em>, vol. 4, pp. 967, 2012, ISSN 1943-0620.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.4.000967"}}, {"title": "Protection of Dynamic and Flexible Bandwidth on Demand in Metro Agile All-Optical Ring Networks", "displayText": "Wei Yang, Sofia A.
