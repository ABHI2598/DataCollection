However, some research work indicates that the delayed S-shaped model may not fit the software failure data well when the testing-effort spent on fault detection is not a constant. Thus, in this paper, we first review the logistic testing-effort function that can be used to describe the amount of testing-effort spent on software testing. We describe how to incorporate the logistic testing-effort function into both exponential-type, and S-shaped software reliability models. The proposed models are also discussed under both ideal, and imperfect debugging conditions. Results from applying the proposed models to two real data sets are discussed, and compared with other traditional SRGM to show that the proposed models can give better predictions, and that the logistic testing-effort function is suitable for incorporating directly into both exponential-type, and S-shaped software reliability models", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "false", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4220785", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220773", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=An+Assessment+of+Testing-Effort+Dependent+Software+Reliability+Growth+Models&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2007&author=Chin-Yu+Huang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.895301&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=198&endPage=211&volumeNum=56&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "44", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Software testing", "Software reliability", "Logistics", "Predictive models", "Reliability engineering", "Software development management", "Engineering management", "Software measurement", "Delay", "Fault detection"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["stochastic processes", "program debugging", "program testing", "software metrics", "software reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["nonhomogeneous Poisson process", "testing-effort dependent software reliability growth model assessment", "software reliability growth measurement", "software failure data", "logistic testing-effort function", "delayed S-shaped software reliability model", "program debugging"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["testing-effort function", "Delayed S-shaped model", "imperfect debugging", "non-homogeneous Poisson process", "software reliability growth models"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An Assessment of Testing-Effort Dependent Software Reliability Growth Models", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9501629"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/ielx5/24/4220773/4220785/html/img", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An Assessment of Testing-Effort Dependent Software Reliability Growth Models", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "The Assessment and Foundation of Bell-Shaped  Testability Growth Effort Functions Dependent System  Testability Growth Models Based on NHPP", "displayText": "Tian-Mei Li, Cong-Qi Xu, Jing Qiu, Guan-Jun Liu, Qi Zhang, \"The Assessment and Foundation of Bell-Shaped  Testability Growth Effort Functions Dependent System  Testability Growth Models Based on NHPP\", <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em>, vol. 2015, pp. 1, 2015, ISSN 1024-123X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/613170"}}, {"title": "CONSIDERING TESTING EFFICIENCY AND TESTING RESOURCE CONSUMPTION VARIATIONS IN ESTIMATING SOFTWARE RELIABILITY", "displayText": "ANSHU GUPTA, REECHA KAPUR, P.
