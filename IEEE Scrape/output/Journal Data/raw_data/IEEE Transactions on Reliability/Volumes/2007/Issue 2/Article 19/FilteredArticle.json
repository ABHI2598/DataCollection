The use in practice of Markov models is, however, hampered by the well-known state space explosion problem. Simulation alleviates the problem. For Markov models of repairable fault-tolerant systems, standard simulation of dependability measures tends to be expensive due to the rarity of the system failure event. Importance sampling can speed up the simulation.
