Classification models which provide a risk-based software quality prediction, such as fault-prone &amp; not fault-prone, are effective in providing a focused software quality assurance endeavor. However, their usefulness largely depends on whether all the predicted fault-prone modules can be inspected or improved by the allocated software quality-improvement resources, and on the project-specific costs of misclassifications. Therefore, a practical goal of calibrating classification models is to lower the expected cost of misclassification while providing a cost-effective use of the available software quality-improvement resources. This paper presents a genetic programming-based decision tree model which facilitates a multi-objective optimization in the context of the software quality classification problem. The first objective is to minimize the \"Modified Expected Cost of Misclassification\", which is our recently proposed goal-oriented measure for selecting &amp; evaluating classification models. The second objective is to optimize the number of predicted fault-prone modules such that it is equal to the number of modules which can be inspected by the allocated resources. Some commonly used classification techniques, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and analogy-based reasoning, are not suited for directly optimizing multi-objective criteria. In contrast, genetic programming is particularly suited for the multi-objective optimization problem. An empirical case study of a real-world industrial software system demonstrates the promising results, and the usefulness of the proposed model", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4220788", "xplore-issue": "4220773", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220773", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+Multi-Objective+Software+Quality+Classification+Model+Using+Genetic+Programming&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2007&author=Taghi+M.+Khoshgoftaar&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.896763&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=237&endPage=245&volumeNum=56&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "19", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Software quality", "Genetic programming", "Costs", "Resource management", "Decision trees", "Classification tree analysis", "Software reliability", "Predictive models", "Context modeling", "Logistics"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["software reliability", "decision trees", "genetic algorithms", "software metrics", "software quality"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["software metrics", "multiobjective software quality classification model", "genetic programming-based decision tree model", "software reliability", "risk-based software quality prediction", "software quality assurance", "software fault-prone module", "software quality-improvement"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["software quality estimation", "Cost of misclassification", "genetic programming", "multi-objective optimization", "software faults", "software metrics"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Multi-Objective Software Quality Classification Model Using Genetic Programming", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9501632"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4220773/4220788", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Multi-Objective Software Quality Classification Model Using Genetic Programming", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "The use of vicinal-risk minimization for training decision trees", "displayText": "Yilong Cao, Peter I.
