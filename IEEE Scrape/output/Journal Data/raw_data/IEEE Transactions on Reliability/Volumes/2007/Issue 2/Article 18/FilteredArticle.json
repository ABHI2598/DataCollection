In statistical terminology, such accelerated testing carries a risk of confounding. For linear models, there is theory which allows one to determine which models are confounded with others. This paper develops analogous theory for a simple kind of confounding model, evanescent processes, when kinetics is used as the basis of modeling accelerated testing. A heuristic for identifying simple evanescent processes that can give rise to disruptive alternatives (alternative models that reverse the decision which would be made based on modeling to date) is outlined. Then, we develop activity mapping, a tool for quantitatively identifying the parameter values of that evanescent process which can result in disruptive alternatives. Finally, we see how activity mapping can be used to identify experiments which help reveal such disruptive evanescent processes"}, "references": [{"title": "The influence of stress on aluminum conductor\nlife", "context": [{"text": " Stress voiding in thin aluminum lines in integrated circuits was discovered in the field [1], [2].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Examples mentioned at the beginning, stress voiding, CAF, and optical gratings written in boron doped optical fiber [1]\u2013[7] show that the probability of such confounding is not negligible.", "sec": "sec5", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "Stress induced failure of Al-Si metal lines has been observed in long lines less than four microns wide.
