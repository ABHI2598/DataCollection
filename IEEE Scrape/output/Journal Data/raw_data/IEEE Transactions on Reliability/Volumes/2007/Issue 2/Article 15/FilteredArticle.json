A recursive algorithm calculates the probability of a given combination of failure numbers in the systems, permitting rapid, accurate determination of the test characteristics. The influence of truncation of Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) on its characteristics is analysed, and relationships are derived for calculating the coordinates of truncation apex (TA).
