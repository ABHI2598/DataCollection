To provide a desired level of service reliability, the RMS can assign the same EB to several independent resources for parallel (redundant) execution. According to the optimal schedule for service task partition, and distribution among resources, one can achieve the greatest possible expected service performance (i.e. least execution time), or reliability. For solving this optimization problem, the paper suggests an algorithm that is based on graph theory, Bayesian approach, and the evolutionary optimization approach.
