Two BDD ordering strategies, and consequently two evaluation algorithms, are proposed to compute the phased-mission system (PMS) reliability based on Markov models for components, and a BDD representation of system structure function. The performance of the two evaluation algorithms is compared. One algorithm generates a smaller BDD, while the other has shorter execution time.
