When selecting an approach to classifying the two sub-populations, one could build a criterion aiming to minimize the expected mis-classification cost due to mis-classifying weak (strong) components as strong (weak). However, in practice, the unit mis-classification cost, such as the cost of mis-classifying a strong component as weak, cannot be estimated precisely. Minimizing the expected mis-classification cost becomes more difficult. This problem is considered in this paper by using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis, which is widely used in the medical decision making community to evaluate the performance of diagnostic tests, and in machine learning to select among categorical models. The paper also uses ROC analysis to determine the optimal time for burn-in to remove the weak population. The presented approaches can be used for the scenarios when the following information cannot be estimated precisely: 1) life distributions of the sub-populations, 2) mis-classification cost, and 3) proportions of sub-populations in the entire population.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4298251", "xplore-issue": "4298224", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4298224", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Classifying+Weak%2C+and+Strong+Components+Using+ROC+Analysis+With+Application+to+Burn-In&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2007&author=Shaomin+Wu&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.897073&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=552&endPage=561&volumeNum=56&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "10", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Cost function", "Decision making", "Degradation", "Information analysis", "Independent component analysis", "Performance analysis", "Medical diagnostic imaging", "Medical tests", "Machine learning", "Life estimation"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "classification", "electronics industry", "life testing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["categorical models", "ROC analysis", "burn-in test", "weak components", "strong components", "misclassification cost", "receiver operating characteristic analysis", "diagnostic tests"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis", "Burn-in", "classification", "mixed distribution"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Classifying Weak, and Strong Components Using ROC Analysis With Application to Burn-In", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9616110"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4298224/4298251", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Classifying Weak, and Strong Components Using ROC Analysis With Application to Burn-In", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Measurement errors in degradation-based burn-in", "displayText": "Qingqing Zhai, Zhi-Sheng Ye, Jun Yang, Yu Zhao, \"Measurement errors in degradation-based burn-in\", <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety</em>, vol. 150, pp. 126, 2016, ISSN 09518320.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2016.01.015"}}, {"title": "Degradation-Based Burn-In Planning Under Competing Risks", "displayText": "Zhi-Sheng Ye, Min Xie, Loon-Ching Tang, Yan Shen, \"Degradation-Based Burn-In Planning Under Competing Risks\", <em>Technometrics</em>, vol. 54, pp. 159, 2012, ISSN 0040-1706.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00401706.2012.676946"}}, {"title": "Maintenance scheduling of a protection system subject to imperfect inspection and replacement", "displayText": "M.D. Berrade, Cristiano A.V.
