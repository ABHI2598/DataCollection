In this paper, we present a low-cost, compositional approach based on the use of the first four statistical moments to characterize the failure time distributions of the constituent components, subsystems, and top-level system. The approach is based on the use of Pearson distributions as an intermediate analytical vehicle, in terms of which the constituent failure time distributions are approximated. The analysis technique is presented for -out-of- systems with identical subsystems, series systems with different subsystems, and systems exploiting standby redundancy. The moment-in-moment-out approach allows for the analysis of systems with arbitrary hierarchy, and arbitrary (unimodal) failure time distributions, provided the subsystems are independent such that the resulting failure time can be expressed in terms of sums or order statistics. The technique consistently exhibits very good accuracy (on average, much less than 1 percent error) at very modest computing cost.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4298250", "xplore-issue": "4298224", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4298224", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Reliability+Analysis+of+Hierarchical+Systems+Using+Statistical+Moments&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2007&author=Gerard+L.+Reijns&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.903132&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=525&endPage=533&volumeNum=56&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "6", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Hierarchical systems", "Failure analysis", "Reliability engineering", "Systems engineering and theory", "Vehicles", "Independent component analysis", "Redundancy", "Statistical analysis", "Statistical distributions", "Costs"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["statistical distributions", "consecutive system reliability", "hierarchical systems", "redundancy", "reliability theory"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["hierarchical systems", "order statistics", "moment-in-moment-out approach", "k-out-of-n systems", "Pearson distributions", "failure time distributions", "systems reliability analysis", "statistical moments"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["redundant systems", "Failure time analysis", "hierarchical systems", "order statistics", "Pearson approximation"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability Analysis of Hierarchical Systems Using Statistical Moments", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9616109"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4298224/4298250", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability Analysis of Hierarchical Systems Using Statistical Moments", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"title": "Reliability Analysis of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$k$</tex></formula>-out-of-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n$</tex></formula> Systems With Single Cold Standby Using Pearson Distributions", "displayText": "Arjan J.
