This method overcomes the deficiency of existing NHPP techniques that fall short of addressing repair, and internal system structures simultaneously. Our solution adopts a MA approach to cover both methods, and is expected to improve reliability prediction. This paradigm allows software components to vary in nature, and can account for system structures due to its ability to integrate individual component reliabilities on an execution path. Component-level modeling supports sensitivity analysis to guide future upgrades, and updates. Moreover, the integration capability is a benefit for incremental software development, meaning only the affected portion needs to be re-evaluated instead of the entire package, facilitating software evolution to a higher extent than with other methods. Several experiments on different system scenarios and circumstances are discussed, indicating the usefulness of our approach.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "false", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4298252", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4298224", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+Moving+Average+Non-Homogeneous+Poisson+Process+Reliability+Growth+Model+to+Account+for+Software+with+Repair+and+System+Structures&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2007&author=Wen-Li+Wang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.903119&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=411&endPage=421&volumeNum=56&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "9", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Sensitivity analysis", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Programming", "Software packages", "Packaging", "Software reliability", "Probability density function", "Information science", "Software architecture", "Testing"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["stochastic processes", "moving average processes", "reliability theory", "sensitivity analysis", "software reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["moving average nonhomogeneous Poisson process", "convolution", "repair", "system structures", "software reliability", "sensitivity analysis", "reliability growth model"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["system structures", "Convolution", "moving average non-homogeneous Poisson process", "sensitivity analysis", "software reliability"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Moving Average Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process Reliability Growth Model to Account for Software with Repair and System Structures", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9620553"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/ielx5/24/4298224/4298252/html/img", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A Moving Average Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process Reliability Growth Model to Account for Software with Repair and System Structures", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Analyzing and forecasting the reliability for repairable systems using the time series decomposition method", "displayText": "Yi\u2010Hui Liang, \"Analyzing and forecasting the reliability for repairable systems using the time series decomposition method\", <em>International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management</em>, vol. 28, pp. 317, 2011, ISSN 0265-671X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02656711111109919"}}, {"title": "RELIABILITY ESTIMATION FOR A DIGITAL INSTRUMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEM", "displayText": "Yang Yaguang, Sydnor Russell, \"RELIABILITY ESTIMATION FOR A DIGITAL INSTRUMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEM\", <em>Nuclear Engineering and Technology</em>, vol. 44, pp. 405, 2012, ISSN 1738-5733.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5516/NET.04.2012.513"}}, {"title": "Applying the generalized autoregressive conditional Heteroskedastic model to analyze and forecast the field failure data of repairable systems", "displayText": "Yi\u2010Hui Liang, \"Applying the generalized autoregressive conditional Heteroskedastic model to analyze and forecast the field failure data of repairable systems\", <em>International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management</em>, vol. 30, pp. 737, 2013, ISSN 0265-671X.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJQRM-Feb-2012-0027"}}, {"title": "Software Reliability", "displayText": "Swapna S.

However, the application of these models is strictly limited to software that satisfies the Markov properties. The objective of our work is to expand the application domain of the Markov-based models, so that most software can be modeled and software reliability can be measured at the architecture level. To overcome the limitations of Markov properties, our model takes execution history i...", "documentLink": "/document/1173211"}, "context": [], "title": "Heterogeneous software reliability modeling", "order": "30", "text": "W.-L.
