In random testing, the sequence of tests (if considered as points in an -dimensional unit hypercube) will give rise to regions where there are clusters of points, as well as underpopulated regions. Quasi-random sequences, also known as low-discrepancy or low-dispersion sequences, are sequences of points in such a hypercube that are spread more evenly throughout. Based on the observation that program faults tend to lead to contiguous failure regions within a program's input domain, and that an even spread of random tests enhances the failure detection effectiveness for certain failure patterns, we examine the use of quasi-random sequences as a replacement for random sequences in automated testing. Because there are only a small number of quasi-random sequence generation algorithms, and each of them can only generate a small number of distinct sequences, the applicability of quasi-random sequences in testing real programs is severely restricted. To alleviate this problem, we examine the use of two types of randomized quasi-random sequences, which are quasi-random sequences permuted in a nondeterministic fashion in such a way as to retain their low discrepancy properties. We show that testing using randomized quasi-random sequences is often significantly more effective than random testing.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "4298227", "xplore-issue": "4298224", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4298224", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Quasi-Random+Testing&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2007&author=Tsong+Yueh+Chen&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2007.903293&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=562&endPage=568&volumeNum=56&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "27", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Automatic testing", "Hypercubes", "Software debugging", "Software testing", "Fault detection", "Random sequences", "Subspace constraints", "Arithmetic", "Chromium", "Australia Council"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["program testing", "fault diagnosis", "program debugging"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["failure detection", "quasirandom sequence testing", "software debug testing", "program faults"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["random testing", "Adaptive random testing", "automated testing", "low-discrepancy sequence", "low-dispersion sequence", "quasi-random sequence"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2007", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Quasi-Random Testing", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "56", "accessionNumber": "9618848"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/4298224/4298227", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Quasi-Random Testing", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "An experimental evaluation of the importance of randomness in hill climbing searches applied to software engineering problems", "displayText": "M\u00e1rcio Barros, \"An experimental evaluation of the importance of randomness in hill climbing searches applied to software engineering problems\", <em>Empirical Software Engineering</em>, pp. , 2014, ISSN 1382-3256.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10664-013-9294-4"}}, {"title": "Automated test data generation using a scatter search approach", "displayText": "Raquel Blanco, Javier Tuya, Belarmino Adenso-D\u00edaz, \"Automated test data generation using a scatter search approach\", <em>Information and Software Technology</em>, vol. 51, pp. 708, 2009, ISSN 09505849.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2008.11.001"}}, {"title": "Address sequences", "displayText": "V.
