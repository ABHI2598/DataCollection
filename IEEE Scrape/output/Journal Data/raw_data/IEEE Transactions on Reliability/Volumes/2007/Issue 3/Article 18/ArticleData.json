The ordinary repairman who stays with the system repairs the minor failures. The expert repairman who is available upon demand repairs the major failures. Various measures of the system effectiveness, such as the mean time to system failure, steady-state availability, busy period of the ordinary as well as expert repairmen, expected number of replacements, etc. are obtained by using semi-Markov processes, and regenerative point Techniques.
