Reliability models for such redundant systems have been widely treated in the literature. These models describe k-out-of-n:G systems, where n is the number of components in the system, and k is the minimum number of components that must work if the overall system is to work. Most of this literature treats the perfect fault coverage case, meaning that the system is perfectly capable of detecting, isolating, and accommodating failures of the redundant elements. However, the probability of accomplishing these tasks, termed fault coverage, is frequently less than unity. Correct modeling of imperfect coverage is critical to the design of highly reliable systems. Even very high values of coverage, only slightly less than unity, will have a major impact on the overall system reliability when compared to the ideal system with perfect coverage. The appropriate coverage modeling approach depends on the system design architecture, particularly the technique(s) used to select among the redundant elements. This paper demonstrates how coverage effects can be computed, using both combinatorial, and recursive techniques, for four different coverage models: perfect fault coverage (PFC), element level coverage (ELC), fault level coverage (FLC), and one-on-one level coverage (OLC). The designation of PFC, ELC, FLC, and OLC to distinguish types of coverage modeling is suggested in this paper."}, "references": [{"title": "A separable method for incorporating imperfect\nfault-coverage in combinatorial models", "context": [{"text": "An ELC algorithm presented in [1]\n.", "sec": "", "part": ""}, {"text": " Only a modest portion of this literature, however, addresses the modeling of fault coverage in the consideration of these redundant systems [1], [3]\u2013[9].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The ELC functions presented in this paper produce results identical to those computed using the SEA algorithm [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " [1] (which covers IFC of the type identified as ELC in this paper).", "sec": "sec2f", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The literature has previously addressed the ELC type model, for instance the SEA algorithm of [1].", "sec": "sec6", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for incorporating imperfect FC (fault coverage) into a combinatorial model.
