Such models are often used because: they are tractable; they are thought to be \"robust;\" they depend only on average values; or only small amounts of data are available for calculations. However, the results of such models can greatly understate the system-reliability for some time periods and overstate it for others. Using MTTF as a figure of merit for system-reliability can be especially misleading. Furthermore, the redundancy in a redundant system might provide very little of the reliability improvement predicted by the constant failure-rate model, and series systems might, in fact, be much more reliable than predicted. The overall result is that a constant failure-rate model can give very misleading guidance for system-design."}, "references": [{"title": "Some theorems relevant to life testing from an exponential distribution", "context": [{"text": "Since its application in the early 1950s to model mortality in actuarial studies for the insurance industry [1], the assumption of a constant failure rate has long been both common and a subject of much debate in reliability engineering.", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/aoms/1177728723", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "B.
