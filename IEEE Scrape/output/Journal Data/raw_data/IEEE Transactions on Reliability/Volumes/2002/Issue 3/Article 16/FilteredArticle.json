Taxonomies for failures and maintenance actions are not fully standardized and can cause confusion. Section II summarizes current usages. The structure of the raw data is identified as: component socket histories with competing risk. Successive sections discuss data-structure and operations on data, data analysis with and without competing risk, and the analysis of uncertainty. In the context of reliability data, the assumption that competing risks are s-independent is frequently unwarranted. Models for dependent competing risk are discussed, and illustrated with examples from pressure-relief-valve data at two Swedish nuclear-power stations."}, "references": [{"title": "The development of a generic data base for failure rates", "context": [{"text": " An earlier model developed for components in nuclear-power stations has found extensive application [1], [27]; the goal was to capture both generic and plant-specific data sources.", "sec": "sec4c", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "A.
