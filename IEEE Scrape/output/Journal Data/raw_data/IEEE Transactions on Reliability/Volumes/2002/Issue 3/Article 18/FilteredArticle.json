A 2-phase system begins its life in a new condition where it resides for a random amount of time before progressing to a worn condition where it resides for a random amount of time preceding system failure. If monitoring takes place while the system is in the worn condition, preventive maintenance is performed. This paper analyzes predictive maintenance policies for systems exhibiting 2-phase behavior, and presents cost-minimizing policies, as well as satisfying policies, to determine when monitoring should take place, and for allocating monitoring resources to multiple systems. The solution approach is based on decomposing the expected cost (per unit time) into 2 components: the expected cost due to maintenance actions, and the expected cost due to monitoring actions. This decomposition facilitates the construction of operating-characteristic curves that represent policy performance, and allows evaluation of the policy tradeoffs in many situations including those with constrained or unconstrained monitoring resources, multiple or single systems, and fixed or nonfixed monitoring intervals."}, "references": [{"title": "A condition based maintenance model with exponential failures and fixed inspection intervals", "context": [{"text": " Additional work related to this type of model is in [1], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jors.0470807", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "F.
