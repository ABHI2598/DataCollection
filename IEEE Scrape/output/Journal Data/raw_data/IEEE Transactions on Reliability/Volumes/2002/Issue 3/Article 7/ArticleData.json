This paper uses simulation techniques to investigate the required sample size for using the large sample Gaussian approximation s-confidence interval and the properties of the ML estimators in the finite sample situation with different fitting models. Both the likelihood function and its second derivatives needed for calculating the asymptotic variance are very complicated. This paper shows that a sample size of 100 is needed in practice for using large-sample inference procedures. When the model is Weibull with a constant shape parameter, fitting exponential models can perform poorly in large-sample cases, and fitting Weibull models with a regression function of shape parameters can give undesirable results in small-sample situations. When small fractions of the product-life distribution are used to establish warranties and service polices, the interests of the producer and consumer should be balanced with the resources available for conducting life tests. From the standpoint of safety, an unrealistically long projected service life could harm the consumer. Establishing a short warranty period protects the producer but hurts revenue. An overly generous warranty period could cost the producer in terms of product replacement. To estimate life-distribution parameters well, use more than 100 samples in for LSCI and life-testing plans derived from the asymptotic theory. When the model becomes complicated, as in this paper, monitor the convergence of the parameter estimation algorithm, and do not trust the computer outputs blindly. In many applications, the likelihood ratio test inverted confidence interval performs better than the usual approximate confidence interval in small samples; thus its performance in the step-stress ALT studies should be in future research.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1028399", "xplore-issue": "22091", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22091", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Performance+of+parameter-estimates+in+step-stress+accelerated+life-tests+with+various+sample-sizes&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2002&author=E.O.+McSorley&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.802888&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=271&endPage=277&volumeNum=51&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "12", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Acceleration", "Life estimation", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Parameter estimation", "Warranties", "Life testing", "Shape", "Gaussian approximation", "Safety", "Protection"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["statistical analysis", "life testing", "maximum likelihood estimation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["cumulative exposure model", "parameter-estimates performance", "step-stress accelerated life-tests", "sample-sizes", "maximum likelihood method", "asymptotic variance", "optimum design", "statistical inferences", "simulation techniques", "Gaussian approximation s-confidence interval", "finite sample situation", "fitting models", "Weibull model", "constant shape parameter", "exponential models fitting", "regression function", "product-life distribution", "warranties", "service polices", "safety", "unrealistically long projected service life", "short warranty period", "generous warranty period", "product replacement", "life-distribution parameters estimation", "parameter estimation algorithm convergence", "likelihood ratio test inverted confidence interval"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Performance of parameter-estimates in step-stress accelerated life-tests with various sample-sizes", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7377106"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/22091/1028399", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Performance of parameter-estimates in step-stress accelerated life-tests with various sample-sizes", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "ESTIMATIONS FOR A SIMPLE STEP-STRESS MODEL WITH PROGRESSIVELY TYPE-II CENSORED DATA", "displayText": "SHUO-JYE WU, HSIU-MEI LEE, DAR-HSIN CHEN, \"ESTIMATIONS FOR A SIMPLE STEP-STRESS MODEL WITH PROGRESSIVELY TYPE-II CENSORED DATA\", <em>International Journal of Reliability Quality and Safety Engineering</em>, vol. 12, pp. 385, 2005, ISSN 0218-5393.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218539305001902"}}, {"title": "Estimating the Generalized Exponential Distribution Parameters and the Acceleration Factor Under Constant-Stress Partially Accelerated Life Testing with Type-II Censoring", "displayText": "Ali A.
