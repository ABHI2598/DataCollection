SRGM proposed in the literature consider the amount of testing-effort spent on software testing which can be depicted as an exponential curve, a Rayleigh curve, or a Weibull curve. However, it might not be appropriate to represent the consumption curve for testing-effort by one of those curves in some software development environments. Therefore, this paper shows that a logistic testing-effort function can be expressed as a software-development/test-effort curve and that it gives a good predictive capability based on real failure-data. Parameters are estimated, and experiments performed on actual test/debug data sets. Results from applications to a real data set are analyzed and compared with other existing models to show that the proposed model predicts better.
