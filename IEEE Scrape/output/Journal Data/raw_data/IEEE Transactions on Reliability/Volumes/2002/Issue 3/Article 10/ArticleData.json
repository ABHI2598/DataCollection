SRGM proposed in the literature consider the amount of testing-effort spent on software testing which can be depicted as an exponential curve, a Rayleigh curve, or a Weibull curve. However, it might not be appropriate to represent the consumption curve for testing-effort by one of those curves in some software development environments. Therefore, this paper shows that a logistic testing-effort function can be expressed as a software-development/test-effort curve and that it gives a good predictive capability based on real failure-data. Parameters are estimated, and experiments performed on actual test/debug data sets. Results from applications to a real data set are analyzed and compared with other existing models to show that the proposed model predicts better. In addition, an optimal software release policy for this model, based on cost-reliability criteria, is proposed.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1028398", "xplore-issue": "22091", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22091", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Analysis+of+incorporating+logistic+testing-effort+function+into+software+reliability+modeling&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2002&author=+Chin-Yu+Huang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.801847&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=261&endPage=270&volumeNum=51&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "75", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Logistics", "Software testing", "Software reliability", "Life testing", "Predictive models", "Cost function", "Programming", "Parameter estimation", "Least squares approximation", "Maximum likelihood estimation"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["parameter estimation", "software reliability", "program testing", "stochastic processes"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["software reliability growth model", "logistic testing-effort function", "software reliability modeling", "nonhomogeneous Poisson process", "software testing", "Rayleigh curve", "exponential curve", "Weibull curve", "consumption curve", "software-development/test-effort curve", "predictive capability", "failure-data", "parameters estimation", "test/debug data sets", "optimal software release policy", "cost-reliability criteria", "mean value function"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analysis of incorporating logistic testing-effort function into software reliability modeling", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7377105"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/22091/1028398", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analysis of incorporating logistic testing-effort function into software reliability modeling", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Cost-reliability-optimal release policy for software reliability models incorporating improvements in testing efficiency", "displayText": "Chin-Yu Huang, \"Cost-reliability-optimal release policy for software reliability models incorporating improvements in testing efficiency\", <em>Journal of Systems and Software</em>, vol. 77, pp. 139, 2005, ISSN 01641212.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2004.10.014"}}, {"title": "Modeling and Analysis of Software Fault Detection and Correction Process Through Weibull-Type Fault Reduction Factor, Change Point and Imperfect Debugging", "displayText": "Subhashis Chatterjee, Ankur Shukla, \"Modeling and Analysis of Software Fault Detection and Correction Process Through Weibull-Type Fault Reduction Factor Change Point and Imperfect Debugging\", <em>Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering</em>, pp. , 2016, ISSN 2193-567X.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-016-2189-0"}}, {"title": "Simultaneous allocation of testing time and resources for a modular software", "displayText": "P.
