Time-specific failure-frequency calculations are required for the systems with shorter mission times. One of the practical uses of time-specific failure-frequency is in finding reasonably accurate estimates of failure-rate and reliability of large systems consisting of repairable components, by using combinatorial methods (without using Markov models). This paper shows that, with some minor modifications, the rules in the original paper for evaluating steady-state failure-frequency can be used to find the time-specific failure-frequency."}, "references": [{"title": "Generic rules to evaluate system-failure frequency", "context": [{"text": " For background and assumptions, see [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "If the system is not under steady-state conditions, then the system failure frequency depends on the mission-time of the system; this was not considered in [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Therefore, this addendum presents the rules to evaluate time-specific system failure and success frequencies that are similar to the rules in [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "Frequency of failure of a system with s-independent components can be obtained from the system availability (unavailability) expression and failure and repair rates of the components.
