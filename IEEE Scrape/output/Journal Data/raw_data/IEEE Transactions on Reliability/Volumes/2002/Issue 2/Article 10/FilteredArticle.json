The objective of model-based reliability analysis (MBRA) is to identify ways to capitalize on the insights gained from physical-response modeling both to supplement the information obtained from testing and to better-understand test results. Five general MBRA processes are identified which can capitalize on physical response modeling results to make both quantitative and qualitative statements about product reliability. A case study that explores 1 of these 5 processes was completed and is described in detail. It had the benefits: MBRA can be used to determine a performance baseline against which current and future test results can be compared; during the design process, MBRA can provide tradeoff studies such that development time and required test assets can be reduced; MBRA can be used to evaluate the impact of production and part changes, as well as aging degradation, if they arise during the product life cycle; and MBRA lays the foundation to evaluate anomalies that are observed in a test program. Typically it has been challenging to determine how anomalous behavior can manifest itself under different-but still valid-conditions. One can use modeling to inject hypothesized behaviors under different conditions and observe the consequences."}, "references": [{"title": "Modeling and simulation of reliability for design", "context": [{"text": "A review article [1] highlights the current state of the tools and capabilities.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-9317(99)00432-3", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "A.
