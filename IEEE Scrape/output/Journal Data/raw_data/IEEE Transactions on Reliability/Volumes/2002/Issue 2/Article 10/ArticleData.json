The objective of model-based reliability analysis (MBRA) is to identify ways to capitalize on the insights gained from physical-response modeling both to supplement the information obtained from testing and to better-understand test results. Five general MBRA processes are identified which can capitalize on physical response modeling results to make both quantitative and qualitative statements about product reliability. A case study that explores 1 of these 5 processes was completed and is described in detail. It had the benefits: MBRA can be used to determine a performance baseline against which current and future test results can be compared; during the design process, MBRA can provide tradeoff studies such that development time and required test assets can be reduced; MBRA can be used to evaluate the impact of production and part changes, as well as aging degradation, if they arise during the product life cycle; and MBRA lays the foundation to evaluate anomalies that are observed in a test program. Typically it has been challenging to determine how anomalous behavior can manifest itself under different-but still valid-conditions. One can use modeling to inject hypothesized behaviors under different conditions and observe the consequences.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1011517", "xplore-issue": "21800", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=21800", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Model-based+reliability+analysis&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2002&author=R.L.+Bierbaum&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.1011517&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=133&endPage=140&volumeNum=51&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "3", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["SPICE", "Failure analysis", "Weapons", "Life testing", "Bit error rate", "Integrated circuit reliability", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Laboratories", "Predictive models", "Signal analysis"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["weapons", "reliability theory"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["part changes", "model-based reliability analysis", "weapon systems", "reliability estimation", "anomalous performance detection", "physical response modeling", "product reliability", "performance baseline", "tradeoff studies", "test assets reduction", "aging degradation", "production changes", "hypothesized behaviors", "CAD", "CAE", "CAM", "CIM", "design margin", "electrical modeling", "life prediction", "SPICE"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Model-based reliability analysis", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7311333"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/21800/1011517", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Model-based reliability analysis", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Reliability Estimation of Parameters of Helical Wind Turbine with Vertical Axis", "displayText": "Adela-Eliza Dumitrascu, Badea Lepadatescu, Dorin-Ion Dumitrascu, Anisor Nedelcu, Doina Valentina Ciobanu, \"Reliability Estimation of Parameters of Helical Wind Turbine with Vertical Axis\", <em>The Scientific World Journal</em>, vol. 2015, pp. 1, 2015, ISSN 2356-6140.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/296762"}}], "ieee": [{"title": "Reliability and Survivability Analysis for UMTS Networks: An Analytical Approach", "displayText": "S.
