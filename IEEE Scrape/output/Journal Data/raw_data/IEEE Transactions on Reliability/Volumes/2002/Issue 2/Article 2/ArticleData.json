From a topological standpoint, the multiservice networks in this paper are heterogeneous systems which integrate both a core and some wireless access networks into an infrastructure similar to third-generation wireless networks. Such networks require reliable and cost-effective solutions to the problem of selecting access technologies for satisfying performance and quality of service requirements related to the services and applications envisioned. This paper analyzes the reliability aspects of some access network topologies to insure a certain level of quality of service at the lowest cost for the end users. It considers a mass market equivalent to 1.6 million subscribers, the objective being to determine the cost the users are ready to pay to benefit from services and applications provided by these multiservice networks. For these purposes, the relative behavior of 3 access-network topologies are studied: the tree with parallel backup links, the ring, and the partially meshed topologies. In ring topology, simulation results show that a great connectivity in the access network is not justified in terms of reliability requirements; the partially meshed topology, even if it has redundant links which affect its cost, outperforms the tree with parallel backup links; and the ring topology is more reliable in terms of disconnected sessions than the tree topology. By considering both reliability and cost, a tree with parallel backup links appears the best topology for the access network and its cost is acceptable for the end user. This study can be extended by: (1) establishing the cost as a function of the quality of service; (2) optimizing the partially meshed topology for more reliable networks; and (3) defining a (shaping) policy to deal with a variety of traffic schemes.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1011530", "xplore-issue": "21800", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=21800", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Reliability+and+cost+evaluation+of+third-generation+wireless+access+network+topologies%3A+a+case+study&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2002&author=F.+Houeto&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.1011530&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=229&endPage=239&volumeNum=51&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "15", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Costs", "Wireless networks", "Network topology", "Computer aided software engineering", "Quality of service", "DSL", "Integrated optics", "Optical network units", "Optical fiber networks", "ISDN"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["radio access networks", "telecommunication network reliability", "quality of service", "costing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["third-generation wireless network", "reliability evaluation", "cost evaluation", "third-generation wireless access network topologies", "bursty traffic", "network dynamics", "multiservice networks", "heterogeneous systems", "quality of service", "mass market equivalent", "parallel backup links", "partially meshed topologies", "reliability requirements", "redundant links", "traffic schemes"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability and cost evaluation of third-generation wireless access network topologies: a case study", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7311344"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/21800/1011530", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "2", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "07 December 2010", "inventors": "Gkantsidis, Christos; Miller, John; Costa, Manuel; Rodriguez, Pablo Rodriguez; Ranson, Stuart", "patentNumber": "7849196", "ipcClassList": "G06F0151730", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US7849196.pdf", "title": "CONNECTION MANAGEMENT IN PEER TO PEER CONTENT DISTRIBUTION CLOUDS", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "709227000, 340002100, 370229000, 707622000, 709224000, 709226000, 709228000, 709229000, 709249000", "pocClasses": ["709227000", "340002100", "370229000", "707622000", "709224000", "709226000", "709228000", "709229000", "709249000"], "filingDate": "04 December 2006", "id": "07849196", "patentAbstract": "A topology management process is implemented which involves removing or \"tearing down\" connections between nodes in certain situations in order to try to replace those connections with more optimal ones.
