Further, it extends the methodology to allow for the analysis of sensitivity of each component for each phase as well as for the entire phased mission, with respect to the multilevel reliability for the GPMS. The conventional phase-OR PMS appear as a special case this GPMS. The advantages of this approach are in the low computational complexity, broad applicability, easy implementation, and high integration (reliability, performance, and sensitivity for GPMS).
