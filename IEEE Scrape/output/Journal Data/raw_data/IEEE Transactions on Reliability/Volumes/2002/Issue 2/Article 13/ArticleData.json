Many papers have appeared in which one or more models are mooted and fitted, and various assessments made of the quality of the fit. At the basic level the data are plotted, together with the fitted curve, to show agreement of experimental and predicted values. In this paper we suggest that it can be useful and informative to go one step further, examining the residuals, i.e., the differences between the experimental and predicted values. We draw attention to certain statistical methods for such critical assessment and show by example that this can reveal deficiencies in fit not otherwise obvious. In this way suitable modifications to the model can be suggested. Additional plots of estimated parameters are also shown to be informative about models.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1011528", "xplore-issue": "21800", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=21800", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=The+use+of+residuals+in+statistical+modeling+for+fatigue-crack+growth+under+constant+amplitude+loading&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2002&author=M.E.+Robinson&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.1011528&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=216&endPage=222&volumeNum=51&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "0", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Residual stresses", "Parameter estimation", "Fatigue", "Stress measurement", "Covariance matrix", "Statistical analysis", "Measurement errors", "Councils", "Investments", "Mathematics"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["measurement errors", "fatigue cracks", "maximum likelihood estimation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["likelihood methods", "residuals", "statistical modeling", "fatigue-crack growth", "constant amplitude loading", "crack growth data", "fitted curve", "experimental and predicted values differences", "statistical methods", "critical assessment", "estimated parameters plots", "correlated errors", "measurement error", "nonlinear growth curves"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "The use of residuals in statistical modeling for fatigue-crack growth under constant amplitude loading", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7311342"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/21800/1011528", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "The use of residuals in statistical modeling for fatigue-crack growth under constant amplitude loading", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {}, "mlTime": "PT0.03553S", "title": "The use of residuals in statistical modeling for fatigue-crack growth under constant amplitude loading", "lastupdate": "2016-11-12T01:55:37", "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0"}, "references": [{"id": "ref1", "refType": "biblio", "context": [{"sec": "sec1", "part": "1", "text": "In the statistical literature, many techniques can be found for analyzing repeated measures made on similar specimens over a period of time (e.g., [1] and the references therein)."}, {"sec": "sec3a", "part": "1", "text": "A suitable statistical model to fit to the crack growth for each specimen is a nonlinear growth-curve model, e.g., [1]."}], "title": "Analysis of Repeated Measures", "order": "1", "text": "M.
