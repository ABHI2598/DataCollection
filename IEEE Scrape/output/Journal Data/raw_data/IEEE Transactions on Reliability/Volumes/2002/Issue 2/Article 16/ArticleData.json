This type of maintenance is typically found in high reliability, mission-oriented applications where it is convenient to perform maintenance after the completion of the mission. This approximation technique can greatly simplify the MTBF analysis for large systems. The motivation for this analysis was to understand the nature of the error in the approximation and to develop a means for quantifying that error. This paper provides the derivation of the equations that bound the error that can result when using this approximation method. It shows that, for most applications, the MTBF calculations can be greatly simplified with only a very small sacrifice in accuracy.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1011521", "xplore-issue": "21800", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=21800", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Approximation+of+mean+time+between+failure+when+a+system+has+periodic+maintenance&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2002&author=M.J.+Mondro&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.1011521&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=166&endPage=167&volumeNum=51&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "7", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Maintenance", "Approximation methods", "Equations", "Error analysis", "Software tools", "Mathematical model", "Reliability engineering"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["approximation theory", "maintenance engineering", "failure analysis", "reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability modeling", "mean time between failure approximation", "periodic maintenance", "MTBF estimation", "high reliability", "mission-oriented applications", "approximation technique", "large systems", "approximation error"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Approximation of mean time between failure when a system has periodic maintenance", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7324634"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/21800/1011521", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Approximation of mean time between failure when a system has periodic maintenance", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Reliability of maintained systems under a semi-Markov setting", "displayText": "Sonia Malefaki, Nikolaos Limnios, Pierre Dersin, \"Reliability of maintained systems under a semi-Markov setting\", <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety</em>, vol. 131, pp. 282, 2014, ISSN 09518320.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2014.05.003"}}, {"title": "Reliability Assessment of CNC Machining Center Based on Weibull Neural Network", "displayText": "Zhaojun Yang, Chao Chen, Jili Wang, Guofa Li, \"Reliability Assessment of CNC Machining Center Based on Weibull Neural Network\", <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em>, vol. 2015, pp. 1, 2015, ISSN 1024-123X.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/292197"}}], "ieee": [{"title": "Bounds on MTBF of Systems Subjected to Periodic Maintenance", "displayText": "S.V.
