For the simplest case multiple availability is defined as the probability that the system is available in the interval [0, t) at each moment of demand. Instants of demand form a homogeneous Poisson process. This setting is generalized to considering a possibility of one or more points of unavailability in [0, t) as well as time redundancy. The corresponding integral equations are derived and solved (wherever possible) via the Laplace transform. A fast repair approach is also applied to each case under consideration and simple approximate relations for multiple availability are obtained. The fast repair approximation makes it possible to derive approximate solutions for problems that cannot be solved by the first approach. The accuracies of the fast repair approximations are analyzed. Generalizations to arbitrary failure and repair distributions are also discussed.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1011522", "xplore-issue": "21800", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=21800", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Laplace-transforms+and+fast-repair+approximations+for+multiple+availability+and+its+generalizations&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2002&author=M.S.+Finkelstein&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.1011522&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=168&endPage=176&volumeNum=51&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "6", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Electric breakdown", "Availability", "Laplace equations", "Hazards", "Exponential distribution", "Failure analysis", "Redundancy", "Integral equations", "Distribution functions", "Statistics"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability", "maintenance engineering", "stochastic processes", "Laplace transforms"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["renewal process", "stochastic models", "fast-repair approximations", "multiple availability", "alternating renewal process", "exponential times to failure", "exponential times to repair", "homogeneous Poisson process", "time redundancy", "integral equations", "fast repair approximation", "repair distributions"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Laplace-transforms and fast-repair approximations for multiple availability and its generalizations", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7324635"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/21800/1011522", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Laplace-transforms and fast-repair approximations for multiple availability and its generalizations", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Instantaneous availability assessment of renewable component in exponential distributions", "displayText": "Guofen Zhang, Yan Xia, Ganggang Xu, \"Instantaneous availability assessment of renewable component in exponential distributions\", <em>Applied Mathematics-A Journal of Chinese Universities</em>, vol. 21, pp. 397, 2006, ISSN 1005-1031.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11766-006-0003-6"}}, {"title": "An overview on reliability, availability, maintainability and supportability (RAMS) engineering", "displayText": "S.
