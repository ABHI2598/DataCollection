First, a feasible set of (k-1) terminal-pairs is chosen, and the 2-terminal reliability functions of the (k-1) terminal-pairs are generated based on the edge expansion diagram using an OBDD (ordered binary decision diagram). Then the k-terminal reliability function can be efficiently constructed by combining these (k-1) reliability expressions with the Boolean and operation. Because building 2-terminal reliability functions and reducing redundant computations by merging reliability functions can be done very efficiently, the proposed approaches are much faster than those which directly expand the entire network or directly factor the k-terminal networks. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by performing experiments on several large benchmark networks. An example of appreciable improvement is that the evaluation of the reliability of a source-terminal 3/spl times/10 all-terminal network took only 2.4 seconds on a SPARC 20 workstation. This is much faster than previous factoring-algorithms.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1044342", "xplore-issue": "22383", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22383", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=OBDD-based+evaluation+of+k-terminal+network+reliability&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2002&author=+Fu-Min+Yeh&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.804736&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=443&endPage=451&volumeNum=51&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "40", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Data structures", "Boolean functions", "Partitioning algorithms", "Merging", "Buildings", "Computer networks", "Workstations", "NP-hard problem"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["Boolean functions", "binary decision diagrams", "reliability theory"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["terminal-pair reliability", "undirected k-terminal network reliability", "2-terminal reliability functions", "(k-1) terminal-pairs generation", "ordered binary decision diagram", "edge expansion diagram", "Boolean and operation", "redundant computations reduction", "source-terminal 3/spl times/10 all-terminal network"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "OBDD-based evaluation of k-terminal network reliability", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7458937"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/22383/1044342", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "OBDD-based evaluation of k-terminal network reliability", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Evaluation of Network Reliability for Computer Networks with Multiple Sources", "displayText": "Yi-Kuei Lin, Louis Cheng-Lu Yeng, \"Evaluation of Network Reliability for Computer Networks with Multiple Sources\", <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em>, vol. 2012, pp. 1, 2012, ISSN 1024-123X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/737562"}}, {"title": "A Comparison between Two All-Terminal Reliability Algorithms", "displayText": "Willem Pino, Teresa Gomes, Robert Kooij, \"A Comparison between Two All-Terminal Reliability Algorithms\", <em>Journal of Advances in Computer Networks</em>, vol. 3, pp. 284, 2015, ISSN 17938244.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.18178/JACN.2015.3.4.183"}}, {"title": "A Novel OBDD-Based Reliability Evaluation Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks on the Multicast Model", "displayText": "Zongshuai Yan, Chenhua Nie, Rongsheng Dong, Xi Gao, Jianming Liu, \"A Novel OBDD-Based Reliability Evaluation Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks on the Multicast Model\", <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em>, vol. 2015, pp. 1, 2015, ISSN 1024-123X.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/269781"}}, {"title": "A novel steady-state genetic algorithm approach to the reliability optimization design problem of computer networks", "displayText": "A.
