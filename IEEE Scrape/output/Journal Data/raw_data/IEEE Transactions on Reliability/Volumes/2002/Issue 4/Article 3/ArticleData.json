Voltage overshoot is one of the integrity factors that has not been sufficiently addressed for the purpose of testing and reliability. Overshoots are known to inject hot-carriers into the gate oxide and cause permanent degradation of MOSFET transistors' performance. This performance degradation creates a serious reliability concern. Unfortunately, accurate parasitic extraction and simulation to detect the interconnect problems is very time consuming and very sensitive to the circuit characteristics and thus is not practical for large SoC. This paper presents a built-in chip methodology to detect and measure the signal overshoots occurring on the interconnects of high-speed system-on-chips. This built-in test strategy does not require external probing or signal waveform monitoring. Instead, the overshoot detector cells monitor signals received by a core (e.g. from the system bus) and record the occurrence of overshoots over a period of operation. The overshoot information accumulated by these cells can be compressed and scanned out efficiently And inexpensively for final quality grading, reliability analysis and diagnosis.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1044349", "xplore-issue": "22383", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22383", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Detecting+signal-overshoots+for+reliability+analysis+in+high-speed+system-on-chips&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2002&author=M.+Nourani&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.804491&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=494&endPage=504&volumeNum=51&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "14", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Signal detection", "Signal analysis", "System-on-a-chip", "Degradation", "Integrated circuit interconnections", "Monitoring", "System testing", "Voltage", "Circuit testing", "Hot carriers"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["failure analysis", "system-on-chip", "integrated circuit reliability", "integrated circuit testing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability diagnosis", "high-speed system-on-chips reliability analysis", "signal-overshoots detection", "signal integrity", "MOSFET", "hot-carriers injection", "performance degradation", "gate oxide", "built-in chip methodology", "final quality grading", "reliability analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Detecting signal-overshoots for reliability analysis in high-speed system-on-chips", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7464585"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/22383/1044349", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "3", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "12 August 2008", "inventors": "Martin, Chris; Johnson, James Brian; Manning, Troy; Keeth, Brent", "patentNumber": "7412634", "ipcClassList": "G01R0312800", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US7412634.pdf", "title": "ON CHIP SAMPLING CIRCUIT AND METHOD", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "714724000, 324762020, 702118000, 714030000, 714045000, 714718000, 716106000", "pocClasses": ["714724000", "324762020", "702118000", "714030000", "714045000", "714718000", "716106000"], "filingDate": "28 February 2007", "id": "07412634", "patentAbstract": "Through addressing circuitry, a sampling circuit can choose a unique internal node/signal on an encapsulated/packaged chip to be output to one or more drivers.
