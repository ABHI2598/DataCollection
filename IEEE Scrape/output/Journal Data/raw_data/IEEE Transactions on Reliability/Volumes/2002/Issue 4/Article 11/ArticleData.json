This makes the conventional package-level reliability tests unsuitable for the modern semiconductor industries due to the long cycle time. The BIR (building-in reliability) methodology, on the contrary, preserves the merits of fast response, early alarm and closed-loop control. For semiconductor manufacturing, the BIR system has two major components: WLR (wafer-level reliability) and the BIR database, which enable us to make use of prior information to reduce risk and time to market. A thorough introduction on BIR system is given in this paper. The use of the BIR database, which is common in the aerospace development, resembles the Bayes approach in statistics. The proposed WLR system includes 4 fundamental elements: WLR design, WLR assessment, WLR baseline and WLR control. Practical concerns, implementations, and examples are depicted on these elements to clarify the WLR applications to the IC (integrated circuit) industries. In Section V, the example 2 on EM test indicates the procedures on formulating the control schemes. Recent studies on WLR and the BIR database after 1994 are also reviewed and described. Promising extensions on BIR and future work are presented. The widespread use of WLR implementations is crucial in solving complex reliability problems.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1044346", "xplore-issue": "22383", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22383", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Practical+%22building-in+reliability%22+approaches+for+semiconductor+manufacturing&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2002&author=+Wei-Ting+Kary+Chen&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.804494&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=469&endPage=481&volumeNum=51&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "15", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Semiconductor device reliability", "Semiconductor device manufacture", "Databases", "Application specific integrated circuits", "Production", "Semiconductor device packaging", "Wafer scale integration", "Semiconductor device testing", "Electronics industry", "Time to market"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["closed loop systems", "semiconductor device manufacture", "reliability", "process control"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["complex reliability problems", "semiconductor manufacturing", "building-in-reliability approaches", "closed-loop control", "fast response", "early alarm", "semiconductor technology", "defective lots identification", "production lines", "wafer-level reliability", "aerospace development", "Bayes approach"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Practical \"building-in reliability\" approaches for semiconductor manufacturing", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7458940"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/22383/1044346", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Practical \"building-in reliability\" approaches for semiconductor manufacturing", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Reliability Baseline Management and Applications in Semiconductor Manufacturing", "displayText": "Wei-Ting Kary Chien, Zhao Yong Atman, Mark Zhang, Ming Li, \"Reliability Baseline Management and Applications in Semiconductor Manufacturing\", <em>International Journal of Reliability Quality and Safety Engineering</em>, pp. 1550006, 2015, ISSN 0218-5393.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218539315500060"}}, {"title": "Some practical considerations for effective and efficient wafer-level reliability control", "displayText": "Summer F.C.
