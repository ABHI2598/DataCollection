Some history and more recent results are discussed along with a description of the present interpretations of the active mass transport mechanisms involved in Cu electromigration. The issue of the dual-damascene process and its potential effect on EM reliability is described with special focus on the peculiarities of the dual-damascene interconnect architecture compared to more conventional subtractively etched Al-based interconnects. Experiments performed on dual-damascene interconnects that highlight electromigration reliability issues such as early failure, a tentative explanation for via electromigration failure, and the Blech effect, are summarized. Emphasis is placed on an experimental methodology that uses large interconnect ensembles in a multi-link configuration. Such a large scale study of nearly 10000 interconnects has shown statistical evidence of bimodal failure behavior consistent with the presence of a weak and strong failure mode, which have been identified as voiding, respectively, within the via and the trench at the cathode end of an interconnect. A multi-link approach has also demonstrated a length-dependent distribution of failures that yields a (j/spl middot/L)/sub c/ product value of about 9000 A/cm in dual-damascene Cu/oxide interconnections and is consistent with mass transport that is controlled by the presence of extended defects within Cu such as grain boundaries, interfaces, and/or surfaces. The study of dual-damascene Cu has demonstrated the importance of statistics in analyzing EM reliability.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1044338", "xplore-issue": "22383", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22383", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Electromigration+reliability+issues+in+dual-damascene+Cu+interconnections&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2002&author=E.T.+Ogawa&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.804737&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=403&endPage=419&volumeNum=51&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "132", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Electromigration", "Microelectronics", "Grain boundaries", "Metallization", "Heating", "Life testing", "History", "Etching", "Large-scale systems", "Cathodes"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["grain boundaries", "copper", "interconnections", "semiconductor device reliability", "electromigration", "cathodes", "failure analysis", "voids (solid)"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["surfaces", "electromigration reliability issues", "dual-damascene Cu interconnections", "active mass transport mechanisms", "Cu electromigration", "EM reliability", "dual-damascene interconnect architecture", "via electromigration failure", "Blech effect", "large interconnect ensembles", "multi-link configuration", "bimodal failure", "weak failure mode", "strong failure mode", "voiding", "trench", "cathode end", "length-dependent failure distribution", "grain boundaries", "interfaces"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Electromigration reliability issues in dual-damascene Cu interconnections", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7458933"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/22383/1044338", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Electromigration reliability issues in dual-damascene Cu interconnections", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Electromigration Reliability in Nanoscale Cu Interconnects", "displayText": "C.-K.
