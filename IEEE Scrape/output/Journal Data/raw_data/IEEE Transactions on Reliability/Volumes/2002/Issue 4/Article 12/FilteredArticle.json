Several decision variables such as inspection frequency, sample size, and termination time at each run, do influence the precision of identifying the important factors and the experimental cost. This paper proposes a systematic approach to the identification problem with respect to fractional factorial degradation experiments. First, an intuitively appealing identification rule is proposed. Next, the optimum test plan is derived using the criterion of minimizing the total experimental cost. The inspection frequency, sample size, and termination time at each run, that are needed by this identification rule are computed by solving a nonlinear integer programming model with a minimum probability of correct selection. A simulation study investigates the efficiency of this method."}, "references": [{"title": "Experimental design for a class of accelerated degradation tests", "context": [{"text": " Reference [1]addresses the problem of designing a class of ADT.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Under the constraints that the life-testing time is pre-determined and the total number of measurement-times is fixed and known, [1]discusses issues such as the times to measure the devices, and the number of devices to test at each stress level.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1269370", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "M.
