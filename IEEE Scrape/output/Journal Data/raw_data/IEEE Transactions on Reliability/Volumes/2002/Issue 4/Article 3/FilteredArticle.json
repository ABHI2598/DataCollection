Voltage overshoot is one of the integrity factors that has not been sufficiently addressed for the purpose of testing and reliability. Overshoots are known to inject hot-carriers into the gate oxide and cause permanent degradation of MOSFET transistors' performance. This performance degradation creates a serious reliability concern. Unfortunately, accurate parasitic extraction and simulation to detect the interconnect problems is very time consuming and very sensitive to the circuit characteristics and thus is not practical for large SoC. This paper presents a built-in chip methodology to detect and measure the signal overshoots occurring on the interconnects of high-speed system-on-chips. This built-in test strategy does not require external probing or signal waveform monitoring. Instead, the overshoot detector cells monitor signals received by a core (e.g. from the system bus) and record the occurrence of overshoots over a period of operation. The overshoot information accumulated by these cells can be compressed and scanned out efficiently And inexpensively for final quality grading, reliability analysis and diagnosis."}, "references": [{"title": "The National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors", "context": [{"text": "The SIA technology roadmap [1] predicts a very aggressive progression of technologies to 0.1 \\$\\mu\\$ m and beyond.", "sec": "sec1a", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Table I shows projections from the SIA roadmap [1].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "The National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, 1997, Sematech, Inc.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Testing systems on a chip", "context": [{"text": " A core is a highly complex logic block which is fully defined, in terms of its behavior, and is also predictable and reusable [2].", "sec": "sec1a", "part": "1"}], "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "Developments in fault-finding circuits built into ICs which will disclose defects in today's and tomorrow's block-based designs are examined.", "documentLink": "/document/542274", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=542274", "pdfSize": "3548KB"}, "id": "ref2", "text": "R.
