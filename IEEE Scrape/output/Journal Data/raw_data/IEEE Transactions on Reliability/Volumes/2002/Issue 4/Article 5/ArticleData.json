In many cases, the failure-generation process is assumed to be stationary, even though the process changes its statistics as time elapses. This paper presents a new estimation procedure for the probabilities of failures; it is based on estimating time-between-failures. The main characteristics of this procedure are that no probability distribution function is assumed for the failure process, and that the failure process is not assumed to be stationary. The model classifies the failures in Q different types, and estimates the probability of each type of failure s-independently from the others. This method does not use histogram techniques to estimate the probabilities of occurrence of each failure-type; rather it estimates the probabilities directly from the values of the time-instants at which the failures occur. The method assumes quasistationarity only in the interval of time between the last 2 occurrences of the same failure-type. An inherent characteristic of this method is that it assigns different sizes for the time-windows used to estimate the probabilities of each failure-type. For the failure-types with low probability, the estimator uses wide windows, while for those with high probability the estimator uses narrow windows. As an example, the model is applied to software reliability data.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1044341", "xplore-issue": "22383", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22383", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+nonparametric+nonstationary+procedure+for+failure+prediction&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2002&author=J.D.+Pfefferman&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.804733&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=434&endPage=442&volumeNum=51&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "9", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Failure analysis", "Predictive models", "Probability distribution", "Software reliability", "Time measurement", "Statistical distributions", "Histograms", "Probability density function", "Random variables", "Testing"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["probability", "software reliability", "failure analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["software reliability data", "software reliability model", "predictive validity", "nonparametric nonstationary procedure", "failure prediction", "time between failures", "reliability models analysis", "failure-generation process", "estimation procedure", "failures probabilities", "time-between-failures estimation", "probability estimation", "time-windows", "low probability"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A nonparametric nonstationary procedure for failure prediction", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7458936"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/22383/1044341", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "1", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "26 June 2007", "inventors": "Garrett, Mark; Markowski, Jeffrey C.; Decker, Ryan; Jay, Paul", "patentNumber": "7236910", "ipcClassList": "G06F0190000", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US7236910.pdf", "title": "EQUIPMENT IDENTIFICATION TRACKING AND FAILURE ANALYSIS PROCESS", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "702183000, 700108000, 702182000, 702184000, 702185000", "pocClasses": ["702183000", "700108000", "702182000", "702184000", "702185000"], "filingDate": "01 February 2005", "id": "07236910", "patentAbstract": "A process for gathering data from a plurality of users at remote terminals connected to a central database that restricts the data entered into the central database by providing users with predefined responses to scripted prompts and screening the new data entered into the central database for erroneous responses by comparing the data with existing data through a series of rules.
