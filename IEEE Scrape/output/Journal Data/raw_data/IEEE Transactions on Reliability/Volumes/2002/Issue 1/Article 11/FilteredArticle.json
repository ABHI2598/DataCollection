Stratification in multichip modules due to the different nature and procurement of these chips is exploited for achieving a high quality-level at a saving of a significant number of tests during assembly. Unlike conventional random testing, the proposed approach (referred to as the lowest yield-stratum first-testing), takes into account the uneven known-good-yield. In the lowest yield-stratum first-testing approach, the effect of the uneven known-good-yield between strata is analyzed with respect to the variance of known-good-yield and the sample size. The lowest yield-stratum first-testing approach significantly outperforms conventional random testing and random stratified testing. This method is competitive even compared to a conventional exhaustive testing at a very small loss in quality-level by greedy (first) testing the chips in the stratum with lower known-good-yield. A Markov-chain model is developed to analyze these testing approaches under the assumption of physically independent failure of chips in multichip module systems."}, "references": [{"title": "High-yield assembly of multichip modules through known-good IC's and effective test strategies", "context": [{"text": " This severely restricts the use of conventional testing approaches [1].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": " DFT is anticipated to be one of the cost-effective solutions for structured MCM testing [1].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "Multichip module technology has been shown to offer significant improvements for electronics equipment in the areas of miniaturized size, reduced weight, capability for higher frequency operation, improved thermal performance, and improved reliability.

Scan flip-flops result in layout and delay overheads. Hence, scan flip-flops have to be chosen such that the net cost associated with these overheads is bounded by some user-specified limit. The problem then reduces to choosing a set of flip-flops which gives the best improvement in testability, while keeping the cost bounded.
