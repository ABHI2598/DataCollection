The K-terminal reliability of this graph is the probability that a given set of vertices K is connected. This reliability problem is #P-complete for general graphs, and remains #P-complete for chordal graphs and comparability graphs. This paper presents a linear-time algorithm for computing K-terminal reliability on proper interval graphs. A graph G = (V, E) is a proper interval graph if there exists a mapping from V to a class of intervals I of the real line with the properties that two vertices in G are adjacent if their corresponding intervals overlap and no interval in I properly contains another. This algorithm can be implemented in O(|V| + |E|) time."}, "references": [{"title": "Computing 2-terminal reliability for radio-broadcast networks", "context": [{"text": " This paper examines a model wherein the edges of the probabilistic graph are perfectly reliable, whereas the vertices fail \\$s\\$-independently with known probabilities [1], [2].", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "The authors present a probabilistic graph model for radio broadcast networks where nodes fail randomly and the edges are perfectly reliable.
