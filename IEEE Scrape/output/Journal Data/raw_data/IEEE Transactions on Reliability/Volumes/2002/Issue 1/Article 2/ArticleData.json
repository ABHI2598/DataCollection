In this kind of system, jobs are executed immediately upon arrival, conditional on system availability. That part of the job which is not served immediately is lost forever and cannot be processed later. Thus, queuing of jobs in such systems is impossible. The effectiveness analysis of real-time systems in a multichannel environment is important. Several definitions of performance effectiveness index for the real-time system under consideration are suggested. The real-time system is treated with exponentially distributed time-to-failure, maintenance, interarrival and duration times as a Markov chain in order to compute its steady-state probabilities and performance effectiveness index via analytic and numerical methods. Some interesting analytic results are presented concerning a worst-case analysis, which is most typical in high-performance data acquisition and control real-time systems.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE
