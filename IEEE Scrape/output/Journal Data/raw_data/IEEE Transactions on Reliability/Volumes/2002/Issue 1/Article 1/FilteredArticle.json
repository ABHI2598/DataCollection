The estimates are used to improve reliability prediction and to prioritize the FRU that potentially need design improvement. Application of the method to a large telecommunication project reveals important differences in the age-dependent reliability estimates and the predicted constant estimate. The observed difference is used to measure the statistical bias due to special causes, and a correction term is added to obtain the improved reliability prediction model. The results of applying the priority scheme to FRU data are encouraging and show the importance of including quality-of-information in decision-making."}, "references": [{"title": "A new process grading reliability model", "context": [{"text": "To address the issue of including special causes in the reliability prediction and design, [1] proposes a reliability model based on 7 causal areas.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "A theory is presented: that a subsumptive neural system coupled with a semi-randomly connected, teachable, neural net will result in cognitive behavior similar to what appears to happen in biological brains.
