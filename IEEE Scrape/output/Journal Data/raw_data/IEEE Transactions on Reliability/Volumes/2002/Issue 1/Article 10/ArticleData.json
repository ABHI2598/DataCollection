In this context, RAM (random access memories) are among the most critical components. This paper proposes a built-in self-repair (BISR) approach for RAM cores. The proposed design, introducing minimal and technology-dependent overheads, can detect and repair a wide range of memory faults including: stuck-at, coupling, and address faults. The test and repair capabilities are used on-line, and are completely transparent to the external user, who can use the memory without any change in the memory-access protocol. Using a fault-injection environment that can emulate the occurrence of faults inside the module, the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in terms of both fault detection and repairing capability was verified. Memories of various sizes have been considered to evaluate the area-overhead introduced by this proposed architecture.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "994929", "xplore-issue": "21459", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=21459", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=An+on-line+BIST+RAM+architecture+with+self-repair+capabilities&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2002&author=A.+Benso&ContentID=10.1109/24.994929&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=123&endPage=128&volumeNum=51&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "31", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Built-in self-test", "Read-write memory", "Random access memory", "Fault detection", "Computer architecture", "Space missions", "Availability", "Space technology", "Testing", "Protocols"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["memory architecture", "random-access storage", "built-in self test", "fault tolerant computing", "computer testing", "fault diagnosis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["area-overhead", "built-in self-test", "on-line BIST RAM Architecture", "self-repair capabilities", "deployable systems", "self-repair computing", "availability", "serviceability", "space missions", "defense applications", "RAM cores", "technology-dependent overheads", "memory faults", "stuck-at faults", "coupling faults", "address faults", "memory-access protocol", "fault-injection environment", "fault detection", "repairing capability"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An on-line BIST RAM architecture with self-repair capabilities", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7257678"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/21459/994929", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "1", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "19 May 2015", "inventors": "Kleveland, Bendik; Sikdar, Dipak K; Chopra, Rajesh; Patel, Jay", "patentNumber": "9037928", "ipcClassList": "G06F0112000000, G11C0294400000, G11C0291600000, G06F0111000000, G11C0291200000, G11C0290600000, G11C0290400000", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US9037928.pdf", "title": "Memory device with background built-in self-testing and background built-in self-repair", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "714710000", "pocClasses": ["714710000"], "filingDate": "02 January 2013", "id": "09037928", "patentAbstract": "A memory device with background built-in self-testing (BBIST) includes a plurality of memory blocks; a memory buffer to offload data from one of the plurality of memory blocks temporarily; and a memory block stress controller to control a stress test applied to the one of the memory blocks when the data is temporarily offloaded on the memory buffer.
