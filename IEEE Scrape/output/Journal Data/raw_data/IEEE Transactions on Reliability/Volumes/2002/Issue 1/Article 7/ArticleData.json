Pearson's s-correlation coefficient is calculated for lognormal and Weibull probability plots of the time-to-fail data. The test statistic is the ratio of the two s-correlation coefficients. When \"standardized\", the lognormal and Weibull variables map into 1 of 2 gamma distributions with no dependence on the shape or scaling factors, confirming earlier observations. Using a set of Monte Carlo simulations, the test statistic was found to be s-normally distributed to good approximation. Formulas for estimating the mean and standard deviation of the test statistic were derived, allowing for an estimate of the probability of hypothesis test errors. As anticipated, the test capability increases with increasing sample size, but only if a substantial fraction of the parts actually fail. If less than 10% of the parts are stressed to failure, then it is almost impossible to distinguish between lognormal and Weibull distributions. If all parts are stressed to failure, the probability of making a correct choice is fair for sample sizes as small as 10, and becomes quite good if the sample size is at least 50. The statistical technique for distinguishing lognormal from Weibull distributions is presented. Its theoretical foundation is given at a qualitative level, and the range of useful application is explored. An approximate form for the distribution of the test statistic is inferred from Monte Carlo simulation.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "994903", "xplore-issue": "21459", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=21459", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Distinguishing+between+lognormal+and+Weibull+distributions+%5Btime-to-failure+data%5D&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2002&author=S.R.+Cain&ContentID=10.1109/24.994903&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=32&endPage=38&volumeNum=51&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "4", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Testing", "Statistical analysis", "Statistical distributions", "Weibull distribution", "Probability", "Shape", "Error analysis", "Regression analysis", "Microelectronics", "Linear regression"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["parameter estimation", "reliability theory", "failure analysis", "Weibull distribution", "log normal distribution", "Monte Carlo methods", "statistical analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability statistics", "lognormal distributions", "Weibull distributions", "time-to-fail data", "Pearson's s-correlation coefficient", "gamma distributions", "Monte Carlo simulations", "hypothesis test errors probability", "test capability", "failure", "probability", "parameter estimation", "regression analysis", "reliability modeling"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Distinguishing between lognormal and Weibull distributions [time-to-failure data]", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7257671"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/21459/994903", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "1", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "05 November 2013", "inventors": "Sehn, Timothy M.; Rauser, John M.; Hunter, Jerry James", "patentNumber": "8577827", "ipcClassList": "G06F0094400000", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US8577827.pdf", "title": "Network page latency reduction using gamma distribution", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "706052000, 370252000, 370329000", "pocClasses": ["706052000", "370252000", "370329000"], "filingDate": "12 March 2010", "id": "08577827", "patentAbstract": "Disclosed are various embodiments of a system, method and computer readable medium for network page latency reduction.
