In this context, RAM (random access memories) are among the most critical components. This paper proposes a built-in self-repair (BISR) approach for RAM cores. The proposed design, introducing minimal and technology-dependent overheads, can detect and repair a wide range of memory faults including: stuck-at, coupling, and address faults. The test and repair capabilities are used on-line, and are completely transparent to the external user, who can use the memory without any change in the memory-access protocol. Using a fault-injection environment that can emulate the occurrence of faults inside the module, the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in terms of both fault detection and repairing capability was verified. Memories of various sizes have been considered to evaluate the area-overhead introduced by this proposed architecture."}, "references": [{"title": "Configurable computing: The road ahead", "context": [{"text": "Most of the research activities on self-repair techniques were focused on FPGA [1]\u2013[5].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "W.
