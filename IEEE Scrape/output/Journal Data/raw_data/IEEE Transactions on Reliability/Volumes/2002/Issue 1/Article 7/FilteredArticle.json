Pearson's s-correlation coefficient is calculated for lognormal and Weibull probability plots of the time-to-fail data. The test statistic is the ratio of the two s-correlation coefficients. When \"standardized\", the lognormal and Weibull variables map into 1 of 2 gamma distributions with no dependence on the shape or scaling factors, confirming earlier observations. Using a set of Monte Carlo simulations, the test statistic was found to be s-normally distributed to good approximation. Formulas for estimating the mean and standard deviation of the test statistic were derived, allowing for an estimate of the probability of hypothesis test errors. As anticipated, the test capability increases with increasing sample size, but only if a substantial fraction of the parts actually fail. If less than 10% of the parts are stressed to failure, then it is almost impossible to distinguish between lognormal and Weibull distributions. If all parts are stressed to failure, the probability of making a correct choice is fair for sample sizes as small as 10, and becomes quite good if the sample size is at least 50. The statistical technique for distinguishing lognormal from Weibull distributions is presented. Its theoretical foundation is given at a qualitative level, and the range of useful application is explored. An approximate form for the distribution of the test statistic is inferred from Monte Carlo simulation."}, "references": [{"title": "The time of `guessing' your failure time distribution is over", "context": [{"text": "Reference [1] is an interesting paper on distinguishing between lognormal (Lgn) and Weibull (Wei) distributions.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The test [1] is based on the ratio of the \\$\\rho\\$s obtained from the probability plots.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Although the critical value can be determined from some desired \\$s\\$-significance level (as is done typically for hypothesis testing and is discussed in [1]), a simple and effective critical value is 1.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Reference [1] empirically found that \\$W/L\\$ did not depend on fitting parameters of the Lgn or Wei distributions, which is critical to the general applicability of the test.", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": " This was evident in the simulations in [1], although the authors did not address this point explicitly.", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0026-2714(98)00083-3", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "K.
