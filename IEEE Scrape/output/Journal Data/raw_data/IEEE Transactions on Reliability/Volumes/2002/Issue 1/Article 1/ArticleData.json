The estimates are used to improve reliability prediction and to prioritize the FRU that potentially need design improvement. Application of the method to a large telecommunication project reveals important differences in the age-dependent reliability estimates and the predicted constant estimate. The observed difference is used to measure the statistical bias due to special causes, and a correction term is added to obtain the improved reliability prediction model. The results of applying the priority scheme to FRU data are encouraging and show the importance of including quality-of-information in decision-making.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "994896", "xplore-issue": "21459", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=21459", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Improved+reliability-prediction+and+field-reliability-data+analysis+for+field-replaceable+units&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2002&author=D.S.+Jackson&ContentID=10.1109/24.994896&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=8&endPage=16&volumeNum=51&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "6", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Resource management", "Predictive models", "Decision making", "Large-scale systems", "Condition monitoring", "Cause effect analysis", "Shape", "Failure analysis", "Random variables"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["probability", "telecommunication equipment", "reliability", "failure analysis", "maintenance engineering"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["decision making", "field-replaceable units", "reliability prediction", "field reliability data analysis", "design improvement", "failure rates", "telecommunication project", "age-dependent reliability", "statistical bias", "correction term", "quality-of-information"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2002", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Improved reliability-prediction and field-reliability-data analysis for field-replaceable units", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "51", "accessionNumber": "7257667"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/21459/994896", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Improved reliability-prediction and field-reliability-data analysis for field-replaceable units", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Reliability evaluation method and algorithm for electromechanical product", "displayText": "Yong-jun Liu, Jin-wei Fan, Yun Li, \"Reliability evaluation method and algorithm for electromechanical product\", <em>Journal of Central South University</em>, vol. 21, pp. 3753, 2014, ISSN 2095-2899.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11771-014-2359-8"}}, {"title": "The use of reliability-oriented field feedback information for product design improvement: a case study", "displayText": "Cl\u00e9ment Magniez, Aarnout C.
