These generalized failure-rate functions are equal to the probability density functions of a doubly-truncated failure-time random variable at the endpoints of the truncating interval. Readers can infer from this paper that this simple estimator can be applied to a doubly-truncated sample of failure times. This commentary explains why that estimator does not apply to the general setting in which the observed failure times are doubly-truncated with subject-specific truncating intervals. A doubly-truncated sample of times to brain tumor progression illustrates the deviation of that estimator from the NPMLE for these data."}, "references": [{"title": "Failure-rate functions for doubly-truncated random variables", "context": [{"text": "Reference [1]takes the novel approach of expressing the Cdf in terms of generalized failure rate functions:\n\n\u2022a conditional forward hazard function, \\$r_1\\$,\n\u2022a conditional reverse hazard function, \\$r_2\\$;\n.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "For observed ordered failure-times, \\$t_1 < t_2 < \\cdots < t_k\\$, [1]suggests estimators for \\$r_1(t_i,\\, t_j)\\$ and \\$r_2(t_i,\\, t_j)\\$ to plug into (1) to obtain the NPMLE of \\$F\\$.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " When there is no censoring, [1] proposes to estimate \\$r_1(t_i,\\, t_j)\\$ by the \u201cnumber of failures at time \\$t_i\\$\u201d divided by the \u201cnumber of failures between \\$t_i\\$ and \\$t_j\\$, inclusive.\u201d Similarly, \\$r_2(t_i,\\, t_j)\\$ is estimated by the \u201cnumber of failures at time \\$t_j\\$\u201d divided by the \u201cnumber of failures between \\$t_i\\$ and \\$t_j\\$, inclusive.\u201d The resulting estimator of \\$F\\$ is the empirical Cdf.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "To illustrate the deviation of the empirical Cdf estimator of \\$F\\$ [1] from the NPMLE when the data are truly doubly-truncated, consider a sample of 36 subjects with a common variant of \u201cmalignant brain tumor.\u201d The subjects in this sample received chemotherapy, experienced progression of their tumors, and died of their disease.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}, {"text": " It is of interest to use these data to estimate the Cdf of \u201ctime to progression\u201d for the \u201cpopulation of subjects with this disease who progress.\u201d Fig. 1 displays the estimator proposed in [1] (solid line) and the NPMLE computed using the algorithm from [3] (dashed line).", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "The failure rate function is generalized for doubly-truncated random variables.
