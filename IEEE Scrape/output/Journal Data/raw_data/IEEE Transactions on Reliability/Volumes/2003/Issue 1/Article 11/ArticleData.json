For that purpose many methods and techniques have been published. However, most of these techniques and methods rely heavily on failure data. Because the design of high-reliability systems generally requires that the individual system components have extremely high reliability, even after long periods of time, and because short product-development times and tightened-budgets imply that reliability tests must be conducted with severe time-constraints, frequently no failures occur during such tests. Thus, there is a growing need to assess reliabilities for complex systems for which it is difficult to collect failure data. This paper focuses on a method that expresses the failure time and consequently the reliability of a system as a function of several explanatory variables (referred to as covariates). Then, the system reliability is assessed indirectly by using information on these covariates. From a practical viewpoint, this method might be more complicated and difficult to apply. The author still recommends this methodology because there are many situations where it is difficult to have data on failure times of expensive and complex systems, and this method can handle such situations.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1208425", "xplore-issue": "26500", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=26500", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Indirect+assessment+of+system+reliability&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2003&author=N.B.+Ebrahimi&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.805779&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=58&endPage=62&volumeNum=52&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "5", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Reliability", "Degradation", "System testing", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Differential equations", "Hazards", "Diffusion processes", "Indium tin oxide", "Stochastic processes", "Stress"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["stochastic processes", "reliability", "failure analysis", "product development", "maximum likelihood estimation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["stress and strength system", "system reliability indirect assessment", "failure data", "high-reliability systems", "short product-development times", "tightened-budgets", "reliability tests", "severe time-constraints", "cumulative damage model", "diffusion process", "hitting time", "Ito process", "log-normal process", "maximum likelihood estimate", "stochastic process"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2003", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Indirect assessment of system reliability", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "52", "accessionNumber": "7778226"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/26500/1208425", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "3", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "12 February 2013", "inventors": "Bailey, William J.; Couet, Benoit; Hogan, James R.; Weir, Iain S.", "patentNumber": "8374834", "ipcClassList": "G06G0074800000", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US8374834.pdf", "title": "Statistical method for analyzing the performance of oilfield equipment", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "703006000, 703010000, 340648000, 340854600, 340604000, 175057000, 175061000, 166265000, 166357000, 166250010, 166313000, 310087000, 073705000", "pocClasses": ["703006000", "703010000", "340648000", "340854600", "340604000", "175057000", "175061000", "166265000", "166357000", "166250010", "166313000", "310087000", "073705000"], "filingDate": "20 August 2010", "id": "08374834", "patentAbstract": "A statistical methodology is disclosed to provide time-to-event estimates for oilfield equipment.
