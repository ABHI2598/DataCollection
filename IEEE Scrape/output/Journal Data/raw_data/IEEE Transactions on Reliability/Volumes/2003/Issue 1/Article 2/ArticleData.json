These generalized failure-rate functions are equal to the probability density functions of a doubly-truncated failure-time random variable at the endpoints of the truncating interval. Readers can infer from this paper that this simple estimator can be applied to a doubly-truncated sample of failure times. This commentary explains why that estimator does not apply to the general setting in which the observed failure times are doubly-truncated with subject-specific truncating intervals. A doubly-truncated sample of times to brain tumor progression illustrates the deviation of that estimator from the NPMLE for these data.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1179788", "xplore-issue": "26500", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=26500", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Commentary%3A+failure-rate+functions+for+doubly-truncated+random+variables&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2003&author=R.A.+Betensky&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.807241&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=7&endPage=8&volumeNum=52&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "7", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Random variables", "Hazards", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Neoplasms", "Probability density function", "Distribution functions", "Public healthcare", "Cancer", "Plugs"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["brain", "maximum likelihood estimation", "tumours", "probability", "failure analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["chemotherapy", "failure-rate functions", "doubly-truncated random variables", "nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator", "failure-time random variable distribution", "generalized failure-rate functions", "probability density functions", "subject-specific truncating intervals", "brain tumor progression", "malignant brain tumor"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2003", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Commentary: failure-rate functions for doubly-truncated random variables", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "52", "accessionNumber": "7778217"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/26500/1179788", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Commentary: failure-rate functions for doubly-truncated random variables", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Characterizations of Life Distributions Using Conditional Expectations of Doubly (Interval) Truncated Random Variables", "displayText": "S.
