To protect information systems from intrusions and thus assure reliability and quality of service, it is highly desirable to develop techniques that detect intrusions. Many intrusions manifest in anomalous changes in intensity of events occurring in information systems. In this study, we apply, test, and compare two EWMA techniques to detect anomalous changes in event intensity for intrusion detection: EWMA for autocorrelated data and EWMA for uncorrelated data. Different parameter settings and their effects on performance of these EWMA techniques are also investigated to provide guidelines for practical use of these techniques.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1179803", "xplore-issue": "26500", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=26500", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Computer+intrusion+detection+through+EWMA+for+autocorrelated+and+uncorrelated+data&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2003&author=+Nong+Ye&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.805796&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=75&endPage=82&volumeNum=52&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "43", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Intrusion detection", "Autocorrelation", "Information systems", "Quality of service", "Operating systems", "Central Processing Unit", "Protection", "Military computing", "Expert systems", "Sun"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["quality of service", "information systems", "security of data", "moving average processes"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["exponentially weighted moving average", "computer intrusion detection", "EWMA", "autocorrelated data", "uncorrelated data", "reliability", "quality of service", "information systems", "cyber intrusions", "anomalous changes", "event intensity", "parameter settings", "anomaly detection", "computer audit data"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2003", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Computer intrusion detection through EWMA for autocorrelated and uncorrelated data", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "52", "accessionNumber": "7778229"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/26500/1179803", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Computer intrusion detection through EWMA for autocorrelated and uncorrelated data", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Communications in Computer and Information Science", "displayText": "Yuesheng Gu, Yanpei Liu, Hongyu Feng, <em>Communications in Computer and Information Science</em>, vol. 244, pp. 434, 2011, ISSN 1865-0929, ISBN 978-3-642-27451-0.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-27452-7_59"}}, {"title": "A Local Search Guided Differential Evolution Algorithm Based Fuzzy Classifier for Intrusion Detection in Computer Networks", "displayText": "T.
