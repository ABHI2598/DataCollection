This utility importance overcomes some drawbacks of a well-known importance measure suggested by William S. Griffith (J. Applied Probability, 1980). The relationship between this new utility importance and the Griffith importance is studied and their difference is illustrated with examples. The contribution of an individual component to the performance utility of a multi-state system is discussed. Examples show that a meaningful index for measuring the performance of individual components in a multi-state system can hardly be defined in general, without considering the actual values of the utility levels and the distributions of the component-states in the system. An example illustrates how genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and tabu search can be used in selecting components and defining the position order of components so that the performance utility of a multi-state system is optimized."}, "references": [{"title": "Reliability Engineering", "context": [{"text": " From the design view-point, it is crucial to identify the weaknesses of the system and how failure of each individual component affects proper functioning of the system; so that efforts can be spent properly to improve the system reliability [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Birnbaum-importance measures the contribution of component-reliability to the system reliability [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Criticality-importance corresponds to the conditional probability of failure of a component, given that the system has failed [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "A system reliability model is developed and demonstrated when the individual components within the system are each subject to individual degradation processes, and for a series system, the system fails when any of the individual failure processes reaches a component-specific failure threshold.
