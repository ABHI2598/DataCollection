In the availability and performability analysis of such a complex system, combinatorial models are computationally efficient but have limited expressive power. State-based models are expressive but computationally complex. Furthermore, this complexity grows exponentially with the size of the model. This state-space explosion problem must be solved in order to model complex-systems using state-based models. The solution, in this paper, is to partition complex models into a hierarchy of submodels, to transform lower-level n-state, m-transition Markov reward models and stochastic reward nets into equivalent (with respect to their steady-state behavior) 2-state, 2-transition models, and then to back-substitute the equivalent submodels into the higher-level models. This paper also proposes a canonical form for the equivalent submodels. This technique is defined for availability models, where the state of the system is either up of down, and for performability models, where the state of the system may be up, down, or partially-up/partially-down. This paper also shows how this technique can be used to obtain common availability measures for telecommunication systems, and when to apply it to availability models and when to use it in performability models. For future work, it would be interesting to more tightly integrate this technique with modeling tools, perhaps coupled with a graphic front-end to facilitate the navigation of the model hierarchy.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1179797", "xplore-issue": "26500", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=26500", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Hierarchical+composition+and+aggregation+of+state-based+availability+and+performability+models&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2003&author=M.+Lanus&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2002.805781&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=44&endPage=52&volumeNum=52&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "33", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Availability", "Power system modeling", "Computational intelligence", "Intelligent networks", "Performance analysis", "Computational modeling", "Telecommunication computing", "Explosions", "Stochastic processes", "Steady-state"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["stochastic processes", "telecommunication network reliability", "Markov processes"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["telecommunication equipment", "hierarchical composition", "state-based availability", "performability models", "telecommunication systems", "multiple intelligent modules", "shelves", "multiple shelves", "combinatorial models", "state-based models", "submodels", "lower-level n-state models", "m-transition Markov reward models", "stochastic reward nets", "2-state 2-transition models", "equivalent submodels", "graphic front-end", "model hierarchy navigation", "equivalent failure rate", "equivalent repair rate", "outage measure"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2003", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Hierarchical composition and aggregation of state-based availability and performability models", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "52", "accessionNumber": "7778224"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/26500/1179797", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Hierarchical composition and aggregation of state-based availability and performability models", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Wiley StatsRef: Statistics Reference Online", "displayText": "Kishor S.
