An approximation for the shortest-path routing policy, maximum-shortest-path (MSP) routing was proposed by Wu (see ibid., vol.48, no.3, p.247-55, 1999). Wu shows that: MSP is optimal in the mesh and hypercube networks; MSP is at least suboptimal in the torus network; MSP is optimal for 6 /spl times/ 6 and 8 /spl times/ 8 tori; and conjectured that MSP is optimal for 2-D tori in general. This short paper shows that, contrary to the claims by Wu, MSP is not optimal for a general N /spl times/ N torus-specifically, MSP is not optimal for a 12 /spl times/ 12 torus, and its optimal routing depends on the success probability."}, "references": [{"title": "An optimal SPR policy for network computers with regular mesh-connected topologies", "context": [{"text": " Several SPR algorithms have been proposed for 2-D meshes and 2-D torus, including the \\$Z^2\\$ routing policy [1], and the MSP routing policy [3].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "It has been shown that in a 2-D mesh or a binary hypercube, both \\$Z^2\\$ and MSP routing policies are optimal [1], [3]; and these two routing policies are the same for 2-D meshes and binary hypercubes.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "A probabilistic routing policy, the Z/sup 2/ (zigzag) routing policy, is presented within the class of nonadaptive, shortest-path routing policies for regular mesh-connected topologies such as n-dimensional toroids and hypercubes.
