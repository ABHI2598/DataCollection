However, it is demonstrated that, under proper conditions, bubble testing can be used to detect both gross and fine leaks, as well as their precise locations. Although not applicable in all situations, these leak-tests offer rapid and effective methods for identifying leak locations in components that are not adversely affected by the increased differential pressure. This method offers additional advantages such as not being fooled by virtual leaks, and indicating exact leak-location of single or multiple leaks in both the gross and fine leak regimes."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2016-11-12T01:54:29", "publisher": "IEEE", "title": "Tubulation techniques for locating fine-leak sites in hermetic electronic packages", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Tubulation techniques for locating fine-leak sites in hermetic electronic packages", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/26500/1179820", "mlTime": "PT0.01987S", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
