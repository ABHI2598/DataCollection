He obtained the B.A. in 1975 in Economics from Cambridge University, and the M.Sc. in 1976 and Ph.D. in 1981 in Transport Planning from Leeds University. Between 1979 and 1982 he worked as a Research Associate at the then Transport Studies Group of University College London, before moving to the Institut f\u00fcr Verkehrswesen at the Technical University of Karlsruhe as an Alexander von Humboldt post-doctoral Research Fellow. In 1984 he took up a New Blood lectureship at the University of Newcastle. In 1992 he became the Deputy Director of the Transport Operations Research Group (TORG), and became its Director in 1996. He was promoted to a Personal Readership in 1994 and to a Personal Chair in 1996. In 2002 he transferred to a Chair at Imperial College London. His research and teaching interests span travel-demand forecasting, traffic engineering and control, and transport telematics. He authored many papers related to the monitoring and control of traffic in networks, in particular, the estimation of path flows and the measurement of network reliability, culminating in Transportation Network Analysis (Wiley, 1997). He is Editor of the Research Studies Press series on traffic engineering and an Associate Editor of Transportation Research B."]}, "name": "M.G.F.

This paper proposes an alternative method which seeks to identify those links or nodes whose failure would impair network performance the most. It is assumed that all links have two costs, a normal cost and a failed cost, both of which can be traffic-dependent. A 2-player, noncooperative, zero-sum game is envisaged between a router, seeking a least-cost path, and a virtual network tester, seeking to maximize trip-cost by failing 1 link. At the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, link-use probabilities are optimal for the router, and link-failure probabilities are optimal for the tester. Finding the equilibrium involves solving a maximin programming problem. When link costs are fixed (not traffic-dependent), the maximin problem can be recast as a linear programming problem. Two forms of the linear programming problem are presented, one requiring path enumeration, and the other not. The interpretation of the primal and dual variables is elucidated by two propositions. Where link costs are traffic-dependent (e.g., where queuing is a feature), the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium can be found by the VISA (method of successive averages). A numerical example illustrates the approach on a stochastic network with queuing. While the example relates to single commodity e.g., where there are multiple origins and destinations."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Network Hub Structure and Resilience", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11067-014-9267-1", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "displayText": "Morton E.
