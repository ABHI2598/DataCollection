In this model (linear multi-state sliding window system), the system consists of n linearly ordered multi-state elements. Each element can have various states: from complete-failure up to perfect-functioning. A performance rate is associated with each state. The sliding window system fails if the sum of the performance rates of any r consecutive multi-state elements is lower than a minimum allowable level. An algorithm for system reliability evaluation is based on an extended universal moment-generating function. Examples of system reliability evaluation are presented."}, "references": [{"title": "\n            On consecutive\n            ", "context": [{"text": " This system was formally introduced in [1], but had been mentioned previously by [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] in connection with tests for nonrandom clustering, quality control and inspection procedures, service systems, and radar problems.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "A.
