As a result of the proposed extension the average number of system failures in a given interval for noncoherent systems can be calculated more efficiently. Furthermore, because Birnbaum's measure of component importance is central to many other measures of importance; its extension should make the derivation of other measures possible."}, "references": [{"title": "Probabilistic Risk Management", "context": [{"text": "FTA [1], [2] is a well known and widely used deductive technique developed by Watson in the early 1960s to enable reliability assessment of a wide variety of systems.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "E.
