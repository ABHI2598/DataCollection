Sherwin recently made the case that the steady-state availability in a series-system is not calculated using the product rule. This commentary offers a clarification by illustrating 2 cases of steady-state series-system availability that frequently arise in reliability engineering. The product rule is valid for steady-state series-system availability under the circumstances: nonfailed components (viz, electrical components) continue to age \"normally\" during the repair of the failed component. Therefore, in computing steady-state availability of series-systems, it is important for practitioners to determine whether the nonfailed components continue to age \"normally\" (case-1) or do not age (case-2). It is also shown that for n/spl ges/2, case-1 steady-state availability of the series-system is smaller than case-2 steady-state series-system availability, and is the same for n=1."}, "references": [{"title": "Steady-state series availability", "context": [{"text": " [1] states: \u201cSome (not all) books and some expensive courses in reliability, suggest that the steady-state availability of a series-system is found by the product rule as for reliability.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " This is wrong.\u201d It continues: \u201cthe correct formulation is no more difficult to calculate than the product rule\u201d it is given in [1] 22reference [1]; page 131; equation (1).", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The question here is: Is [1], (1) correct, or is the product rule of component availability correct?
