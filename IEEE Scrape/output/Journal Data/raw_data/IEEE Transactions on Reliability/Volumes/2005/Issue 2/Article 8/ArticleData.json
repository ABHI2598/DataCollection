This problem is subject to constraints related to the design, such as required structural, physical, and technical characteristics; and the components available in the market. This last constraint implies that system components, and their reliability, must belong to a finite set. For a parallel-series system, we show that the problem can be modeled as an integer linear program, and solved by a decomposition approach. The problem is decomposed into as many sub-problems as subsystems, one sub-problem for each subsystem. The sub-problem for a given subsystem consists of determining the number of components of each type in order to reach a given reliability target with a minimum cost. The global problem consists of determining the reliability target of subsystems. We show that the sub-problems are equivalent to one-dimensional knapsack problems which can be solved in pseudopolynomial time with a dynamic programming approach. We show that the global problem can also be solved by a dynamic programming technique. We also show that the obtained method YCC converges toward an optimal solution.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1435717", "xplore-issue": "30936", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30936", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+new+dynamic+programming+method+for+reliability+%26amp%3B+redundancy+allocation+in+a+parallel-series+system&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2005&author=A.+Yalaoui&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.847270&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=254&endPage=261&volumeNum=54&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "43", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Dynamic programming", "Redundancy", "Cost function", "Upper bound", "Reliability engineering", "Maintenance", "Dynamic scheduling", "Constraint optimization"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["knapsack problems", "dynamic programming", "reliability theory", "redundancy", "linear programming", "cost reduction"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["knapsack problems", "dynamic programming", "reliability", "redundancy allocation", "parallel-series system", "integer linear program", "cost reduction"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability", "Allocation", "dynamic programming", "parallel-series system", "redundancy"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A new dynamic programming method for reliability &amp; redundancy allocation in a parallel-series system", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8449752"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30936/1435717", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A new dynamic programming method for reliability &amp; redundancy allocation in a parallel-series system", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A Simulation-Based Optimization Approach for Free Distributed Repairable Multi-State Availability-Redundancy Allocation Problems", "displayText": "Ahmad Attar, Sadigh Raissi, Kaveh Khalili-Damghani, \"A Simulation-Based Optimization Approach for Free Distributed Repairable Multi-State Availability-Redundancy Allocation Problems\", <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety</em>, pp. , 2016, ISSN 09518320.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2016.09.006"}}, {"title": "Optimal Resource Allocation", "displayText": "pp. 69, 2013, ISBN 9781118400715.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781118400715.ch5"}}, {"title": "Encyclopedia of Statistics in Quality and Reliability", "displayText": "Way Kuo, Rui Wan, pp. , 2008, ISBN 9780470018613.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9780470061572.eqr479"}}, {"title": "Efficient immune algorithm for optimal allocations in series-parallel continuous manufacturing systems", "displayText": "Y.
