We propose a test power reduction methodology for SOC cores through scan chain modification. By inserting logic gates between scan cells, a given set of test vectors & captured responses is transformed into a new set of inserted stimuli & observed responses that yield fewer scan chain transitions. In identifying the best possible scan chain modification, we pursue a decoupled strategy wherein test data are decomposed into blocks, which are optimized for power in a mutually independent manner. The decoupled handling of test data blocks not only ensures significantly high levels of overall power reduction but it furthermore delivers computational efficiency at the same time. The proposed methodology is applicable to both fully, and partially specified test data; test data analysis in the latter case is performed on the basis of stimuli-directed controllability measures which we introduce. To explore the tradeoff between the test power reduction attained by the proposed methodology & the computational cost, we carry out an analysis that establishes the relationship between block granularity & the number of scan chain modifications. Such an analysis enables the utilization of the proposed methodology in a computationally efficient manner, while delivering solutions that comply with the stringent area & layout constraints in SOC as well."}, "references": [{"title": "Test power reduction through minimization of scan chain transitions", "context": [], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "Parallel test application helps reduce the otherwise considerable test times in SOCs; yet its applicability is limited by average and peak power considerations.

An average pattern of test patterns of a test set is found for both cases of where the test set is fully specified and not fully specified, inverters are judiciously inserted into the scan path and each test pattern is then modified by XOR-ing it with the average test pattern to produce a modified test pattern, which produces less toggling, translating to less power consumption. Further, the random filling of don't cares, as opposed to 0-fill, 1-fill, or adjacent fill, increases defect detection through collateral coverage. </p>", "title": "LOW POWER SCAN SHIFTING WITH RANDOM LIKE TEST PATTERNS", "patentNumber": "7779320", "filingDate": "21 February 2008", "assignees": ["LSI CORP"], "ipcClasses": ["G01R0312800", "G06F0110000"], "grantDate": "17 August 2010", "inventors": "Chmelar, Erik", "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7779320.PN.&OS=PN/7779320", "pocClasses": ["714726000", "714741000"], "pocClassList": "714726000, 714741000", "order": "2"}], "lastupdate": "2016-08-04T16:35:06", "isEarlyAccess": false, "publisher": "IEEE", "title": "Test power reductions through computationally efficient, decoupled scan chain modifications", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "3", "publicationNumber": "24", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Test power reductions through computationally efficient, decoupled scan chain modifications", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30936/1435713", "mlTime": "PT0.100474S", "ieeeCitationCount": "9"}}
