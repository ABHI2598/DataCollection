A decreasing hazard rate approaching a value greater than zero is its distinctive characteristic. Potentially, many mechanisms of failure can produce mortality laws of Hyperbolic type. The \"Deterioration\", \"Stress-Strength\", and \"Shocks\" failure models discussed here are such models. To make the use of the Hyperbolic model easier, the maximum likelihood estimators of its parameters are given. They can be calculated without any difficulty, and appear to be acceptable for practical technological applications. Finally, two applicative examples are given. These examples exhibit that when the mechanism of failure is one of the types discussed, the Hyperbolic model shows a better fit compared with other alternative reliability models, like Gamma, and Weibull.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1435720", "xplore-issue": "30936", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30936", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Origins%2C+properties%2C+and+parameters+estimation+of+the+hyperbolic+reliability+model&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2005&author=P.+Erto&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.847267&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=276&endPage=281&volumeNum=54&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "2", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Parameter estimation", "Hazards", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Electric shock", "Electric breakdown", "Life estimation", "Distribution functions", "Probability density function", "Random variables", "Least squares methods"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["maximum likelihood estimation", "reliability theory", "parameter estimation", "failure analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["maximum likelihood estimator", "parameters estimation", "hyperbolic reliability", "deterioration", "stress-strength", "failure mechanism", "Weibull distribution"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["model identification", "Failure mechanism", "hazard rate", "increasing mean residual life", "maximum likelihood estimator"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Origins, properties, and parameters estimation of the hyperbolic reliability model", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8449753"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30936/1435720", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Origins, properties, and parameters estimation of the hyperbolic reliability model", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"title": "Some Basic Properties of the Failure Rate of Redundant Reliability Systems in Industrial Electronics Applications", "displayText": "Elio Chiodo, Davide Lauria, \"Some Basic Properties of the Failure Rate of Redundant Reliability Systems in Industrial Electronics Applications\", <em>Industrial Electronics IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 62, pp. 5055-5062, 2015, ISSN 0278-0046.", "order": "1", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042841", "pdfSize": "403KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/7042841"}}, {"title": "Analytical study of different probability distributions for wind speed related to power statistics", "displayText": "E.
