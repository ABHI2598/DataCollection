We propose a test power reduction methodology for SOC cores through scan chain modification. By inserting logic gates between scan cells, a given set of test vectors & captured responses is transformed into a new set of inserted stimuli & observed responses that yield fewer scan chain transitions. In identifying the best possible scan chain modification, we pursue a decoupled strategy wherein test data are decomposed into blocks, which are optimized for power in a mutually independent manner. The decoupled handling of test data blocks not only ensures significantly high levels of overall power reduction but it furthermore delivers computational efficiency at the same time. The proposed methodology is applicable to both fully, and partially specified test data; test data analysis in the latter case is performed on the basis of stimuli-directed controllability measures which we introduce. To explore the tradeoff between the test power reduction attained by the proposed methodology & the computational cost, we carry out an analysis that establishes the relationship between block granularity & the number of scan chain modifications. Such an analysis enables the utilization of the proposed methodology in a computationally efficient manner, while delivering solutions that comply with the stringent area & layout constraints in SOC as well.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1435713", "xplore-issue": "30936", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30936", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Test+power+reductions+through+computationally+efficient%2C+decoupled+scan+chain+modifications&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2005&author=O.+Sinanoglu&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.847276&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=215&endPage=223&volumeNum=54&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "12", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["System-on-a-chip", "Logic testing", "Parallel processing", "Power dissipation", "Logic gates", "Computational efficiency", "Design for testability", "Automatic test pattern generation", "Time to market", "Fasteners"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["data analysis", "reliability theory", "system-on-chip", "logic gates"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["system-on-chip", "decoupled scan chain modification", "time minimization", "core test", "power dissipation", "test power reduction", "logic gates", "test data analysis", "computational cost"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Test power reductions through computationally efficient, decoupled scan chain modifications", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8459829"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30936/1435713", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "2", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "16 February 2016", "inventors": "Sinanoglu, Ozgur", "order": "1", "patentNumber": "9262292", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US9262292.pdf", "title": "Test access system, method and computer-accessible medium for chips with spare identical cores", "assignees": ["NEW YORK UNIVERSITY"], "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9262292.PN.&OS=PN/9262292", "filingDate": "07 June 2013", "id": "09262292", "patentAbstract": "Exemplary system, method and computer-accessible medium for testing a multi-core chip can be provided which can have and/or utilize a plurality of identical cores.

The basic idea is to identify an input control pattern for a full-scan circuit such that by applying the pattern to the primary inputs of the circuit during the scan operation, the switching activity in the combinational part can be minimized or even eliminated. A D-algorithm-like pattern generator is developed to generate the control pattern. This input control technique can b...", "documentLink": "/document/810769"}, "context": [{"sec": "sec2", "part": "1", "text": "Methodologies that are applied at the test application stage [9], [10] have also been proposed."}, {"sec": "sec2", "part": "1", "text": " An interesting addition to the exploration of the aforementioned degree of freedom can be seen in [10], which delays the conversion to the primary input combination necessitated at the capture cycle while trying to identify a consistent primary input value to be applied at the intervening cycles."}], "title": "An input control technique for power reduction in scan circuits during test application", "order": "10", "text": "T.
