This approach extends the graphical approach used by several authors by considering the natural ordering of performance degradation data using a truncated Weibull distribution. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to provide a one-step method to estimate the model's parameters. A closed form expression of the likelihood function is derived for a two-parameter truncated Weibull distribution with time-independent shape parameter. A semi-numerical method is presented for the truncated Weibull distribution with a time-dependent shape parameter. Numerical studies of generated data suggest that the proposed approach provides reasonable estimates even for small sample sizes. The analysis of fatigue data shows that the proposed approach yields a good match of the crack length mean value curve obtained using the path curve approach and better results than those obtained using the graphical approach.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1435725", "xplore-issue": "30936", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30936", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=An+alternative+degradation+reliability+modeling+approach+using+maximum+likelihood+estimation&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2005&author=+Wei+Huang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.845965&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=310&endPage=317&volumeNum=54&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "28", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Degradation", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Weibull distribution", "Fatigue", "Statistical analysis", "Physics", "Parameter estimation", "Failure analysis", "Shape", "Data analysis"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["graph theory", "maximum likelihood estimation", "Weibull distribution", "reliability theory", "numerical analysis", "fatigue testing", "crack detection"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["order statistics", "degradation reliability modeling approach", "maximum likelihood estimation", "natural ordering", "performance degradation data", "truncated Weibull distribution", "one-step method", "closed form expression", "time-independent shape parameter", "seminumerical method", "crack length mean value curve", "path curve approach"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["Weibull distribution", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "order statistics", "performance degradation data analysis", "reliability modeling"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An alternative degradation reliability modeling approach using maximum likelihood estimation", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8449756"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30936/1435725", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An alternative degradation reliability modeling approach using maximum likelihood estimation", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "The set-theory method for systems reliability of structures with degrading components", "displayText": "Gordon J.
