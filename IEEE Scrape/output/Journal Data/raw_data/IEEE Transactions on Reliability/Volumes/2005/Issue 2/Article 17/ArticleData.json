In this paper, we develop a generalized condition-based maintenance model subject to multiple competing failure processes including two degradation processes, and random shocks. An average long-run maintenance cost rate function is derived based on the expressions for the degradation paths & cumulative shock damage, which are measurable. A geometric sequence is employed to develop the inter-inspection sequence. Upon inspection, one needs to decide whether to perform a maintenance, such as preventive or corrective, or to do nothing. The preventive maintenance thresholds for degradation processes & inspection sequences are the decision variables of the proposed model. We also present an algorithm based on the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method to calculate the optimum policy that minimizes the average long-run maintenance cost rate. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the results using the optimization algorithm.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1435726", "xplore-issue": "", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30936", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=An+inspection-maintenance+model+for+systems+with+multiple+competing+processes&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2005&author=+Wenjian+Li&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.847264&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=318&endPage=327&volumeNum=54&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "72", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Degradation", "Inspection", "Electric shock", "Cost function", "Preventive maintenance", "Predictive models", "Random variables", "Systems engineering and theory", "Aging", "Availability"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "failure analysis", "preventive maintenance", "inspection"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability maintenance", "inspection-maintenance model", "multiple competing failure process", "failure rate", "vibration level", "random shock", "generalized condition-based maintenance model", "degradation process", "average long-run maintenance cost rate function", "degradation path", "cumulative shock damage", "geometric sequence", "preventive maintenance", "decision variable", "Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method", "optimum policy", "optimization algorithm"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability maintenance", "Degradation", "inspection-maintenance policy", "multiple competing processes", "random shocks"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An inspection-maintenance model for systems with multiple competing processes", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8459836"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30936/1435726", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An inspection-maintenance model for systems with multiple competing processes", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Reliability modeling for dependent competing failure processes with changing degradation rate", "displayText": "Koosha Rafiee, Qianmei Feng, David W.
