In this paper, burn-in procedures for a general failure model are considered. There are two types of failure in the general failure model. One is Type I failure (minor failure), which can be removed by a minimal repair or a complete repair; and the other is Type II failure (catastrophic failure), which can be removed only by a complete repair. During the burn-in process, two types of burn-in procedures are considered. In Burn-In Procedure I, the failed component is repaired completely regardless of the type of failure; whereas, in Burn-In Procedure II, only minimal repair is done for the Type I failure, and a complete repair is performed for the Type II failure. Under the model, various additive cost functions are considered. It is assumed that the component before undergoing the burn-in process has a bathtub-shaped failure rate function with the first change point t/sub 1/, and the second change point t/sub 2/. The two burn-in procedures are compared in cases when both the procedures are applicable. It is shown that the optimal burn-in time b/sup */ minimizing the cost function is always before t/sub 1/. It is also shown that a large initial failure rate justifies burn-in, i.e., b/sup */>0. The obtained results are applied to some examples."}, "references": [{"title": "General failure model applied to preventive maintenance policies", "context": [{"text": " See, for example, [1], [2], [15], [18], [19].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "The reliability behavior of systems is investigated if two types of failures can happen.
