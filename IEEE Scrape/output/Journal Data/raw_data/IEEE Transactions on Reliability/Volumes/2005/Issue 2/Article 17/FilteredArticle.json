In this paper, we develop a generalized condition-based maintenance model subject to multiple competing failure processes including two degradation processes, and random shocks. An average long-run maintenance cost rate function is derived based on the expressions for the degradation paths & cumulative shock damage, which are measurable. A geometric sequence is employed to develop the inter-inspection sequence. Upon inspection, one needs to decide whether to perform a maintenance, such as preventive or corrective, or to do nothing. The preventive maintenance thresholds for degradation processes & inspection sequences are the decision variables of the proposed model. We also present an algorithm based on the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method to calculate the optimum policy that minimizes the average long-run maintenance cost rate. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the results using the optimization algorithm."}, "references": [{"title": "\n            Reliability and MTTF prediction of\n            ", "context": [{"text": " In some cases, if the degradation level exceeds a specified threshold limit, the system may not operate successfully [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " [1] presented a model based on a Markov approach for predicting the reliability of \\$k\\$-out-of-\\$n\\$: \\$G\\$ systems in which components are subject to multi-stage degradation as well as catastrophic failures.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207729608929304", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "H.
