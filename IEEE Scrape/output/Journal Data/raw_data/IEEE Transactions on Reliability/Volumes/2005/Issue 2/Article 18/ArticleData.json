The systems are either circular or linear. It is assumed that the working time, and the repair time of each component in the system are both exponentially distributed; and every component after repair is 'as good as new'. Each component is classified as either a key component, or an ordinary one according to its priority role to the system's repair. By using the definition of generalized transition probability, the state transition probabilities of the system are derived. Some important indices related to repairmen are obtained, and some reliability indices are derived by using the Laplace transform technique. Numerical examples are then studied in detail to demonstrate the theoretical results developed in the paper. The proposed method, and its numerical illustrations for the examples verify the validity & generality of the studied system.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1435727", "xplore-issue": "30936", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30936", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Repairable+consecutive-k-out-of-n%3A+G+systems+with+r+repairmen&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2005&author=+Yueqin+Wu&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.847250&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=328&endPage=337&volumeNum=54&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "16", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Circuit testing", "System testing", "Laplace equations", "State-space methods", "Probability", "Reliability engineering", "Design engineering", "Circuit synthesis", "Qualifications"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["exponential distribution", "consecutive system reliability", "maintenance engineering", "Laplace transforms"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["Laplace transform technique", "repairable consecutive-k-out-of-n: G system", "repairmen", "exponential distribution", "system repair", "generalized transition probability", "state transition probabilities", "reliability indices"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["repairable consecutive-k-out-of-n: G system", "Generalized transition probability", "key components", "reliability"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Repairable consecutive-k-out-of-n: G systems with r repairmen", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8459837"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30936/1435727", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Repairable consecutive-k-out-of-n: G systems with r repairmen", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Review of recent advances in reliability of consecutive &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-out-of-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; and related systems", "displayText": "S Eryilmaz, \"Review of recent advances in reliability of consecutive &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-out-of-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; and related systems\", <em>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers Part O Journal of Risk and Reliability</em>, vol. 224, pp. 225, 2010, ISSN 17480078.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1243/1748006XJRR332"}}, {"title": "Reliability analysis of repairable consecutive\u2010k\u2010out\u2010of\u2010n: G systems with sensor and repairmen", "displayText": "Ragi Krishnan, S.
