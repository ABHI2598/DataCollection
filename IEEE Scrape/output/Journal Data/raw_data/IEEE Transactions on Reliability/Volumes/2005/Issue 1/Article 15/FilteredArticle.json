Trivially, this conditional probability is larger than the standard probability, viz. the product of all components' probabilities. Yet it can be shown that also without this new interpretation of the formula for the availability of a series-system without aging during repairs it is exceptionally easy to prove the fact that by no aging during repairs, the availability of series-systems increases; a most plausible result."}, "references": [{"title": "Steady-state sries availability", "context": [{"text": "AS MENTIONED correctly in [1], there exist series-systems where on a failure of \\$C_{i}\\$ all other components stop working aging.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " A simple formal proof of (1) for \\$A_{1}(n)\\$, and \\$A_{2}(n)\\$, as they are given in [1], and [2], will also be derived.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Furthermore, \\$A_{2}(n)\\$ will be derived via induction as hinted at in [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "As is well known, for \\$s\\$-independent components, the steady-state availability of a repairable series-system is as given by Equation (1) in [2], i.e.,In the case of no aging during system down-time, by Equation (2) of [2], or Equation (2) of [1], a repairable series-system steady-state availability is, as shown here in Section II.", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "In repairable systems, the steady-state availability is one of the more important factors in specifications and choice of hardware.
