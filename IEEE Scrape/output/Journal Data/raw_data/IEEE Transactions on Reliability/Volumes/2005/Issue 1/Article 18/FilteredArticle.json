A tradeoff analysis between the cost invested by these two mobility handoff strategies for maintaining the logging and checkpoint information before failure versus the return of investment in terms of improved failure recoverability is given, and the best checkpoint interval period that would yield the best return of investment for the eager mobility handoff strategy over the lazy strategy is identified."}, "references": [{"title": "Recovery in mobile environments: design and trade-off analysis", "context": [{"text": "The subject of failure recovery of mobile client-server applications has received considerable attention in recent years [1]\u2013[6] due to its potential applicability.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The existing protocols discern themselves in the issue of where to store checkpoint and logging information, with most of them assuming that the MH's disk storage is not stable (i.e., no hard disk), and thus checkpoint and logging information will be stored at base stations in the wireless network [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Pradhan, Krishna, and Vaidya [1] proposed two uncoordinated checkpoint protocols: No-logging versus Logging.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Performance analysis of Logging versus No-logging was reported [1], but no analysis was given on the recovery time behavior.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Under the Eager mobility handoff strategy [1], we always keep the logging and checkpoint information in the base station under which the MH currently resides.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "The mobile wireless environment poses challenging problems in designing fault-tolerant systems because of the dynamics of mobility, and limited bandwidth available on wireless links.
