The use of offline built-in self-test (BIST) techniques for periodic testing imposes the interruption of the normal operation of the circuit under test. On the other hand, the use of input vector monitoring concurrent BIST techniques for periodic testing provides the capability to perform the test, while the circuit under test continues to operate normally. In this paper, a novel input-vector monitoring concurrent BIST technique for combinational circuits based on a self-testing RAM, termed R-CBIST, is presented. The presented technique compares favorably to the other input vector monitoring concurrent BIST techniques proposed so far with respect to the hardware overhead, and the time required for the concurrent test to be completed (concurrent test latency). R-CBIST can be utilized to test ROM because it results in small hardware overhead, whereas there is no need to stop the ROM normal operation."}, "references": [{"title": "An effective BIST scheme for ROMs", "context": [{"text": "very high effective fault coverage (which is achieved with exhaustive testing, that covers all logically testable faults [1], [7], [8]).", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "a \\$k\\$-stage Non-linear Feedback Shift Register termed online_NFSR; An NFSR is a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) augmented with nonlinear elements (usually a multiple input AND gate, and a two-input XOR gate) so that it can generate the all-zero state among the sequence it generates [1]. online_NFSR is clocked every time a RAM word overflows; thus, it is utilized to identify the end of the test.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}, {"text": " This kind of testing is enough to cover all logically testable faults [1].", "sec": "sec8", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "A built-in self-test (BIST) scheme for ROMs that has very high fault coverage and very small likelihood of error escape (aliasing) is described.
