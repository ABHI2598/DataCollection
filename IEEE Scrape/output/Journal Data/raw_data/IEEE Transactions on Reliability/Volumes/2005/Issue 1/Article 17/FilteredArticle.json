In this paper, we extend an empirical calibration methodology for adjusting the failure rate estimate obtained from analysing test data. In addition to scaling the estimated failure rate of a fault, we propose scaling the estimated number of residual faults as well. We also derive likelihood ratio tests to formally determine (from previous releases of the software) if test, and field environments are significantly different. We illustrate our new results with two telecommunications case studies. The combination of the likelihood ratio test, and the calibration methodology offers a practical way to extend the application of software reliability growth models to less formal test environments."}, "references": [{"title": "Handbook of Software Reliability Engineering", "context": [{"text": " Predicting the failure rate based on observations from a test environment that is substantially different from the user's environment can lead to very inaccurate failure rate predictions [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Reference [1] provides a good overview of the vast literature on methods for identifying fault-prone modules based on software metrics.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Additional references that provide good historical perspectives on the use of NHPP as SRGM are [1], [9], and [10].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "M.
