It is a strict assumption, and usually not valid in reality. Goseva-Popstojanova & Trivedi (2000) presented an interesting study on failure correlation among successive software runs. In this paper, by extending their results, a software reliability model is developed based on a Markov renewal process for the modeling of the dependence among successive software runs, where more than one type of failure is allowed in general formulation. Meanwhile, the cases of restarting with repair, and without repair, are considered. Although such a model is more complex than the traditional approach based on reliability growth, it incorporates more information about the failures, and system structure. A numerical example is also shown to illustrate the procedure, and provide some comparison.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1402688", "xplore-issue": "30454", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30454", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Modeling+and+analysis+of+correlated+software+failures+of+multiple+types&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2005&author=+Yuan-Shun+Dai&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.841709&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=100&endPage=106&volumeNum=54&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "55", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Failure analysis", "Software reliability", "Software performance", "Systems engineering and theory", "Reliability engineering", "Software testing", "Degradation", "Distribution functions", "Materials requirements planning", "Information science"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["Markov processes", "software reliability", "failure analysis", "software maintenance"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["multiple failure types", "correlated software failure", "software reliability model", "failure correlation", "successive software runs", "Markov renewal process", "repair", "reliability growth", "system structure", "dependent software runs", "failure category"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["software reliability", "Dependent software runs", "failure category", "failure correlation", "Markov renewal process", "multiple failure types"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Modeling and analysis of correlated software failures of multiple types", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8334843"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30454/1402688", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Modeling and analysis of correlated software failures of multiple types", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Transfer function modelling in software reliability", "displayText": "S.

Existing methods fail to provide benefits over crude Monte Carlo for analyzing systems that contain important component-redundancies. This paper presents refined importance-sampling techniques that are also based on the regenerative technique. The new methods use an importance-sampling plan t...", "documentLink": "/document/974123"}, "context": [{"sec": "sec2", "part": "1", "text": " This is also one of the most widely used methods in reliability and availability studies of complex systems, such as [8], and [15]\u2013[17]\n[18]."}], "title": "Estimating reliability measures for highly-dependable markov systems using balanced likelihood ratios", "order": "17", "text": "C.
