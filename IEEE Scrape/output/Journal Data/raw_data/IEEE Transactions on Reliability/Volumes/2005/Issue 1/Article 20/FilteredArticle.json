The reliability measure has been defined as capacity related reliability (CRR). The proposed method, subset cut technique (SCT), requires the cutset information of the network. For each minimal cut C/sub i/, and a given minimum bandwidth requirement W/sub min/, the method enumerates all nonredundant subset cut (SC), where each SC relates link capacities & minimum bandwidth requirements. Note that if all links in an SC fail, the capacity of the induced cut C/sub i/ will be less than W/sub min/. Given the failure probability of each link, and the nonredundant SC, any Boolean technique for generating mutually disjoint terms can be utilized to obtain a capacity related unreliability (CRU) of the network. Thus, the CRU for an (s,t) node pair is the probability that the network has a capacity of less than W/sub min/ for the given node pair. Note that CRR=1-CRU. Two SCT algorithms are proposed: Algorithm-1, and Algorithm-2; and the suitability of using either algorithm is also discussed. Examples are given to illustrate the techniques. The time complexity, and the proof of correctness for the proposed algorithms are also included. It is shown empirically that the time complexity of generating the nonredundant SC of a network is polynomial in the order of the number of cuts of the network. The proposed SCT algorithms have been implemented in C. We have utilized the SCT to generate the CRR of some large communication networks with various W/sub min/ values."}, "references": [{"title": "CAREL: Computer Aided Reliability evaluator for distributed computer networks", "context": [{"text": "Various measures for the reliability index of a communication network are proposed in the literature [1]\u2013[19], [24], [25].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " In one measure, the reliability index of the network is represented by its terminal reliability, which is defined as the probability that there exists at least one path for a given source-destination \\$(s,t)\\$ node pair of the network [1]\u2013[5].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Any Boolean techniques [1], [2], [4], [5] can be used to generate the mutually disjoint expression for the NMSC.", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Finally, using CAREL [1], we get the expression for CRU.", "sec": "sec3b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Then, assuming an equal link reliability of 0.9 for all links, and utilizing CAREL [1] on the NMSC, we compute the CRU, and hence the CRR of the networks.", "sec": "sec5", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Table VI shows, for each \\$W_{\\rm min}\\$, the number of NMSC produced, the number of disjoint products generated (using CAREL [1] from each of the NMSC set), and the running time of our SCT method.", "sec": "sec5", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "An efficient method to compute the terminal reliability (the probability of communication between a pair of nodes) of a distributed computing system (DCS) is presented.
