This model can be regarded as a unified model of the censored and truncated models. Using the model, we can not only estimate the ratio of the fragile population to the mixed fragile and durable populations, but also test a hypothesis that the ratio is equal to a prescribed value. A central point of the paper is that such a test can easily be realized through the newly introduced trunsored model, because it has been difficult to do such a hypothesis test under only the framework of censored and truncated models. Therefore, the relationship of the trunsored model to the censored and truncated models is clarified because the trunsored model unifies the censored and truncated models. The paper also shows how to obtain the estimates of the parameters in lifetime estimation, and corresponding confidence intervals for the fragile population. Typical examples applied to electronic board failures, and to breast cancer data, for lifetime estimation are demonstrated, and successfully worked using the trunsored model.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1402675", "xplore-issue": "30454", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30454", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=The+trunsored+model+and+its+applications+to+lifetime+analysis%3A+unified+censored+and+truncated+models&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2005&author=H.+Hirose&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.837521&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=11&endPage=21&volumeNum=54&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "7", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Life estimation", "Lifetime estimation", "Testing", "Parameter estimation", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Medical treatment", "Data models", "Breast cancer", "Exponential distribution", "Weibull distribution"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["maximum likelihood estimation", "Weibull distribution", "life testing", "failure analysis", "exponential distribution"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["Weibull distribution", "trunsored model", "lifetime estimation analysis", "unified censor", "incomplete data model", "fragile population", "censored data models", "electronic board failures", "breast cancer data", "bootstrap", "durable population", "exponential distribution", "likelihood ratio test", "limited failure population", "mixture model", "truncated data"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["Weibull distribution", "Bootstrap", "censored data", "durable population", "exponential distribution", "fragile population", "grouped data", "likelihood ratio test", "limited failure population", "mixture model", "truncated data"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "The trunsored model and its applications to lifetime analysis: unified censored and truncated models", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8327178"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30454/1402675", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "The trunsored model and its applications to lifetime analysis: unified censored and truncated models", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Estimation of the number of failures in the Weibull model using the ordinary differential equation", "displayText": "Hideo Hirose, \"Estimation of the number of failures in the Weibull model using the ordinary differential equation\", <em>European Journal of Operational Research</em>, vol. 223, pp. 722, 2012, ISSN 03772217.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2012.07.011"}}, {"title": "The mixed trunsored model with applications to SARS", "displayText": "Hideo Hirose, \"The mixed trunsored model with applications to SARS\", <em>Mathematics and Computers in Simulation</em>, vol. 74, pp. 443, 2007, ISSN 03784754.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matcom.2006.06.031"}}, {"title": "Bayesian estimation of mixed Weibull distributions", "displayText": "Anduin E.
