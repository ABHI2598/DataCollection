The method is compared to conventional load-strength interference theory. The results are identical for the case of homogeneous material, but reliability is shown to reduce for the same load as the component volume increases. The case of a tensile bar is used to explore the variation of reliability with component volume.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1402695", "xplore-issue": "30454", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30454", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+method+to+take+account+of+inhomogeneity+in+mechanical+component+reliability+calculations&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2005&author=+Jian-Ping+Li&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.837702&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=159&endPage=168&volumeNum=54&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "5", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Materials reliability", "Failure analysis", "Stress", "Aerospace materials", "Interference", "US Department of Transportation", "Fault trees", "Aerospace engineering", "Manufacturing", "Materials testing"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["failure analysis", "reliability", "materials testing", "Monte Carlo methods", "tensile strength"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability variation", "material inhomogeneity", "mechanical component reliability calculation", "Monte-Carlo simulation", "material strength index", "standard deviation", "load-strength interference theory", "homogeneous material", "tensile bar"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["Monte Carlo", "Material inhomogeneity", "mechanical reliability"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A method to take account of inhomogeneity in mechanical component reliability calculations", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8327184"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30454/1402695", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A method to take account of inhomogeneity in mechanical component reliability calculations", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Reliability in Power Electronics and Electrical Machines: Industrial Applications and Performance Models", "displayText": "pp. 120, 2016, ISBN 9781466694293.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-4666-9429-3.ch003"}}], "ieee": [{"title": "Dynamic Reliability Model of Components Under Random Load", "displayText": "Wang Zheng, Xie Liyang, \"Dynamic Reliability Model of Components Under Random Load\", <em>Reliability IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 57, pp. 474-479, 2008, ISSN 0018-9529.", "order": "1", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4585406", "pdfSize": "146KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4585406"}}, {"title": "Reliability Enhancement of MEMS Lateral Comb Resonators Under Fault Conditions", "displayText": "Afshin Izadian, Parviz Famouri, \"Reliability Enhancement of MEMS Lateral Comb Resonators Under Fault Conditions\", <em>Control Systems Technology IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 16, pp. 726-734, 2008, ISSN 1063-6536.", "order": "2", "links": {"pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4480896", "pdfSize": "1666KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "documentLink": "/document/4480896"}}, {"title": "Blind number theory and its application in optimization design of mechanical structure time-dependent reliability", "displayText": "Pengyan Guo, Boqiang Shi, Chengyong Xiao, Youshan Hou, Yong Jiang, \"Blind number theory and its application in optimization design of mechanical structure time-dependent reliability\", <em>Grey Systems and Intelligent Services 2009.
