A wireless distributed sensor network (DSN) is a self-organizing , ad-hoc network of a large number of cooperative intelligent sensor nodes. Due to the limited power of sensor nodes, energy-efficient DSN are essentially multi-hop networks. The self-organizing capabilities, and the cooperative operation of DSN allow for forming reliable clusters of sensors deployed near, or at, the sites of target phenomena. Reliable monitoring of a phenomenon (or event detection) depends on the collective data provided by the target cluster of sensors, and not on any individual node. The failure of one or more nodes may not cause the operational data sources to be disconnected from the data sinks (command nodes or end user stations). However, it may increase the number of hops a data message has to go through before reaching its destination (and subsequently increase the message delay). In this paper, we focus on two related problems: computing a measure for the reliability of DSN, and computing a measure for the expected & the maximum message delay between data sources (sensors) & data sinks in an operational DSN. Given an estimation of the failure probabilities of the sensors, as well as the intermediate nodes (nodes used to relay messages between data sources, and data sinks), we use a probabilistic graph to model DSN. We define the DSN reliability as the probability that there exists an operating communication path between the sink node, and at least one operational sensor in a target cluster. We show that both problems are #P-hard for arbitrary networks. We then present two algorithms for computing the reliability, and the expected message delay for arbitrary networks. We also consider two special cases where efficient (polynomial time) algorithms are developed. Finally, we present some numerical results that demonstrate some of the applications of our algorithms.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1402693", "xplore-issue": "30454", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30454", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Computing+reliability+and+message+delay+for+Cooperative+wireless+distributed+sensor+networks+subject+to+random+failures&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2005&author=H.M.F.+AboElFotoh&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.842540&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=145&endPage=155&volumeNum=54&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "78", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Wireless sensor networks", "Computer networks", "Distributed computing", "Intelligent sensors", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Delay", "Telecommunication network reliability", "Clustering algorithms", "Ad hoc networks", "Energy efficiency"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["failure analysis", "intelligent sensors", "ad hoc networks", "wireless sensor networks", "telecommunication network reliability", "telecommunication network routing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["routing algorithm", "message delay computing", "reliability computing", "cooperative wireless distributed sensor network", "random failures", "heterogeneous smart sensor node", "complex information gathering task", "ad-hoc network", "cooperative intelligent sensor nodes", "energy-efficient DSN", "multihop network", "self-organizing capability", "event detection", "target cluster", "data sources", "data sink", "failure probability", "intermediate nodes", "communication path", "polynomial time", "expected network diameter", "graph-theoretic algorithm", "probabilistic graph model"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["wireless sensor networks", "Clustering", "distributed sensor networks", "expected message delay", "expected network diameter", "graph-theoretic algorithms", "multi-hop networks", "probabilistic graph models", "reliability"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Computing reliability and message delay for Cooperative wireless distributed sensor networks subject to random failures", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8327183"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30454/1402693", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Computing reliability and message delay for Cooperative wireless distributed sensor networks subject to random failures", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Transmission Reliability Evaluation for Wireless Sensor Networks", "displayText": "Xiaojuan Zhu, Yang Lu, Jianghong Han, Lei Shi, \"Transmission Reliability Evaluation for Wireless Sensor Networks\", <em>International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks</em>, vol. 2016, pp. 1, 2016, ISSN 1550-1329.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/1346079"}}, {"title": "Efficient deployment of wireless sensor networks targeting environment monitoring applications", "displayText": "Fadi M.
