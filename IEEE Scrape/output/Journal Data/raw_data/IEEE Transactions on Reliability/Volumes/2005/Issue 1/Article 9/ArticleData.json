This can easily be generalized to multiple objectives with, say, precision targets for various estimates, stress limits constraint, sample size constraint, etc. In the absence of actual cost, the cost of conducting the test is related to the total test time at different stress levels, and the total sample size needed for the test. The framework is applied to planning of constant stress ALT, in which the logarithm of the lifetime follows the extreme value distribution. The proposed framework consistently leads to more cost-effective test plans without compromising the precision of the estimate, and is equally robust to misspecification of initial estimates, compared with other test plans presented in the literature.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1402681", "xplore-issue": "30454", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30454", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+multiple+objective+framework+for+planning+accelerated+life+tests&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2005&author=+Loon-Ching+Tang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.841731&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=58&endPage=63&volumeNum=54&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "11", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Life estimation", "Life testing", "Stress", "Cost function", "Meeting planning", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Time factors", "Robustness", "Systems engineering and theory", "Lifetime estimation"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["production testing", "life testing", "sampling methods", "optimisation", "reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliability", "multiple objective framework", "accelerated life test planning", "goal programming", "multiple objective optimization", "statistical precision", "stress limits constraint", "sample size constraint", "constant stress planning", "extreme value distribution"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["planning accelerated testing", "Goal programming", "multiple objective optimization"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A multiple objective framework for planning accelerated life tests", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8334838"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30454/1402681", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A multiple objective framework for planning accelerated life tests", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "MULTIOBJECTIVE DESIGN OF EQUIVALENT ACCELERATED LIFE TESTING PLANS", "displayText": "HAITAO LIAO, ZHAOJUN LI, \"MULTIOBJECTIVE DESIGN OF EQUIVALENT ACCELERATED LIFE TESTING PLANS\", <em>International Journal of Reliability Quality and Safety Engineering</em>, vol. 15, pp. 515, 2008, ISSN 0218-5393.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218539308003209"}}, {"title": "Pathological behaviors of fisher confidence bounds for Weibull distribution", "displayText": "Huairui Guo, Haitao Liao, Rong Pan, Alexander Aron, Adamantios Mettas, \"Pathological behaviors of fisher confidence bounds for Weibull distribution\", <em>Computers & Industrial Engineering</em>, vol. 58, pp. 717, 2010, ISSN 03608352.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2010.02.001"}}, {"title": "Optimal design of accelerated life testing plans under progressive censoring", "displayText": "Yada Zhu, Elsayed A.
