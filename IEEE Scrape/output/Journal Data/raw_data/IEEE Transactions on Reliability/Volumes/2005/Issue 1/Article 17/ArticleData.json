Using test data exclusively to estimate a field failure rate will not usually give a very accurate estimate. In this paper, we extend an empirical calibration methodology for adjusting the failure rate estimate obtained from analysing test data. In addition to scaling the estimated failure rate of a fault, we propose scaling the estimated number of residual faults as well. We also derive likelihood ratio tests to formally determine (from previous releases of the software) if test, and field environments are significantly different. We illustrate our new results with two telecommunications case studies. The combination of the likelihood ratio test, and the calibration methodology offers a practical way to extend the application of software reliability growth models to less formal test environments.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1402689", "xplore-issue": "30454", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30454", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Adjusting+software+failure+rates+that+are+estimated+from+test+data&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2005&author=D.R.+Jeske&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.842531&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=107&endPage=114&volumeNum=54&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "26", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Software testing", "Software maintenance", "Software reliability", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Calibration", "Data analysis", "Failure analysis", "Application software", "Light rail systems", "Aircraft"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["stochastic processes", "software reliability", "calibration", "program testing", "failure analysis", "maximum likelihood estimation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["test data", "software failure rate", "calibration factor", "likelihood ratio test", "nonhomogeneous Poisson process", "software reliability growth model", "failure rate scaling", "maximum likelihood estimation"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["software reliability growth model", "Calibration factors", "likelihood ratio test", "nonhomogeneous Poisson process", "software failure rate"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Adjusting software failure rates that are estimated from test data", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8334844"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30454/1402689", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Adjusting software failure rates that are estimated from test data", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "OPERATIONAL SOFTWARE PERFORMABILITY EVALUATION BASED ON MARKOVIAN RELIABILITY GROWTH MODEL WITH SYSTEMABILITY", "displayText": "KOICHI TOKUNO, TOSHINORI FUKUDA, SHIGERU YAMADA, \"OPERATIONAL SOFTWARE PERFORMABILITY EVALUATION BASED ON MARKOVIAN RELIABILITY GROWTH MODEL WITH SYSTEMABILITY\", <em>International Journal of Reliability Quality and Safety Engineering</em>, vol. 19, pp. 1240001, 2012, ISSN 0218-5393.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218539312400013"}}, {"title": "Improving software reliability prediction through multi-criteria based dynamic model selection and combination", "displayText": "Jinhee Park, Jongmoon Baik, \"Improving software reliability prediction through multi-criteria based dynamic model selection and combination\", <em>Journal of Systems and Software</em>, vol. 101, pp. 236, 2015, ISSN 01641212.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.12.029"}}, {"title": "Software Reliability", "displayText": "Swapna S.
