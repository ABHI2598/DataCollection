It was also found that, in the storage test at 300/spl deg/C for 24 hours, diffusion of Pt into GaAs was accelerated when the SiO/sub 2/ deposition temperature was lower than 380/spl deg/C. FT-IR spectra indicated that the lower deposition temperature leads to a higher concentration of the residual hydrogen in SiO/sub 2/.
