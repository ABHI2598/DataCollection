Test units are subjected to elevated stresses which yield shorter lives. For some products whose life is defined by usage, e.g., mileage and cycles, test units are also run at higher usage rates (UR) to compress the test time. This paper presents a method for testing products at both higher stress levels, and UR. Censoring time is pre-determined and fixed, while censoring usage is a function of UR. A UR effect model is proposed to describe the dependence of usage to failure (UTF) on UR. The relationship between UTF, and stress and UR is established, and used to estimate the UTF distribution at design stresses and usual UR. The model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood method. The best compromise test plans, which choose the UR, stress levels, and sample sizes, are devised by minimizing the asymptotic variance of the estimator of a life percentile at design stresses and usual UR. The efficiency, and sensitivity of the test plans are evaluated. The results show that the test plans are efficient, and robust.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1402680", "xplore-issue": "30454", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30454", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Accelerated+life+tests+at+higher+usage+rates&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2005&author=+Guangbin+Yang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.841730&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=53&endPage=57&volumeNum=54&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "16", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Life estimation", "Life testing", "Stress", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Business continuity", "Manufacturing", "Parameter estimation", "Robustness", "Sensitivity analysis", "Shape"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability", "life testing", "stress analysis", "maximum likelihood estimation", "sensitivity analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["sensitivity analysis", "accelerated life tests", "higher usage rates", "usage to failure", "product life distributions", "product testing", "UR effect model", "usage to failure distribution", "design stresses", "model parameter estimation", "maximum likelihood method", "asymptotic variance", "compromise test plan"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["usage rate", "Accelerated life test", "compromise test plan", "sensitivity analysis", "usage effect"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Accelerated life tests at higher usage rates", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8334837"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/30454/1402680", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Accelerated life tests at higher usage rates", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Pathological behaviors of fisher confidence bounds for Weibull distribution", "displayText": "Huairui Guo, Haitao Liao, Rong Pan, Alexander Aron, Adamantios Mettas, \"Pathological behaviors of fisher confidence bounds for Weibull distribution\", <em>Computers & Industrial Engineering</em>, vol. 58, pp. 717, 2010, ISSN 03608352.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2010.02.001"}}, {"title": "Effects of different test profiles of temperature cycling tests on the reliability of RFID tags", "displayText": "Sanna Lahokallio, Kirsi Saarinen-Pulli, Laura Frisk, \"Effects of different test profiles of temperature cycling tests on the reliability of RFID tags\", <em>Microelectronics Reliability</em>, vol. 55, pp. 93, 2015, ISSN 00262714.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microrel.2014.09.032"}}, {"title": "Design of accelerated life testing plans under multiple stresses", "displayText": "Yada Zhu, Elsayed A.
