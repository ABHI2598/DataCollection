It was found that the mean time to failure (MTTF) of MESFET with 350/spl deg/C-depositied SiO/sub 2/ was only about one-seventh of that of the ones with 440/spl deg/C-SiO/sub 2/. It was also found that, in the storage test at 300/spl deg/C for 24 hours, diffusion of Pt into GaAs was accelerated when the SiO/sub 2/ deposition temperature was lower than 380/spl deg/C. FT-IR spectra indicated that the lower deposition temperature leads to a higher concentration of the residual hydrogen in SiO/sub 2/. Thermal differential spectrometry (TDS) demonstrated that hydrogen in SiO/sub 2/ could migrate even below 300/spl deg/C. In conclusion, the residual hydrogen in SiO/sub 2/ causes the degradation phenomena."}, "references": [{"title": "Long-term and instantaneous burnout in GaAs power FETs: mechanisms and solutions", "context": [{"text": " It has been reported that the surface oxide, whose composition is \\${\\hbox {As}}_{2}{\\hbox {O}}_{3}\\$, causes burn-out failure to GaAs MESFET [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "Catastrophic source-drain burnout is an important failure mode in GaAs power FET's.
