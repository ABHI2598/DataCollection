First, each node collects precise fault information within distance-d, and then fault information about nodes that are more than distance-d away is coded in a special way. Specifically, in our approach, each node in a cube-based multicomputer of dimension n is associated with an extended safety vector of n bits. In the extended safety vector model, each node knows fault information within distance-2; fault information outside distance-2 is coded in a special way based on the coded information of its neighbors. The extended safety vector of each node can be easily calculated through n-1 rounds of information exchanges among neighboring nodes. Therefore, each extended safety vector is an approximated measure of the number & distribution of faults in the neighborhood. Optimal unicasting between two nodes is guaranteed if the kth bit of the safety vector of the source node is one, where k is the Hamming distance between the source & destination nodes. In addition, the extended safety vector can be used as a navigation tool to direct a message to its destination through a minimal path. A simulation study has been conducted based on different selections of d, and results have shown a significant improvement under the proposed model over the safety vector model in handling link faults, even for a small value of d as in the extended safety vector model where d=2.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1505045", "xplore-issue": "32272", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32272", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Optimal%2C+and+reliable+communication+in+hypercubes+using+extended+safety+vectors&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2005&author=+Jie+Wu&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.853439&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=402&endPage=411&volumeNum=54&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "3", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Hypercubes", "Safety", "Routing", "Very large scale integration", "Hamming distance", "Navigation", "Computer science", "Computer architecture", "Laboratories", "Network topology"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["encoding", "hypercube networks", "safety systems", "fault tolerant computing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["reliable communication", "hypercube", "extended safety vector", "coding method", "cube-based multicomputer", "Hamming distance", "link fault", "fault-tolerant routing"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["safety vectors", "Fault-tolerant routing", "generalized hypercubes", "multicomputers", "reliable communication"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Optimal, and reliable communication in hypercubes using extended safety vectors", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8568678"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/32272/1505045", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Optimal, and reliable communication in hypercubes using extended safety vectors", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"title": "Fault tolerant routing using improved safety vectors", "displayText": "Rajib K.
