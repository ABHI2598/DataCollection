Importance measures are important tools to evaluate & rank the impact of individual components within a system. For multi-state systems, previously developed measures do not meet all user needs. The major focus of the study is to distinguish between two types of importance measures which can be used for evaluating the criticality of components in MSMC with respect to multi-state system reliability. This paper presents Type 1 importance measures that are involved in measuring how a specific component affects multi-state system reliability. A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation methodology for estimating the reliability of a MSMC is used for computing the proposed CIM metrics. Previous approaches (Type 2) have focused on investigating how a particular component state or set of states affects multi-state system reliability. For some systems, it is not clear how to prioritize system component importance, collectively considering all of its states, using the previously developed importance measures. That detracts from those measures. Experimental results show that the proposed CIM can be used as an effective tool to assess component criticality for MSMC. Examples are used to illustrate & compare the proposed CIM with previous multi-state importance measures."}, "references": [{"title": "How to calculate system reliability and safety characteristics", "context": [{"text": " Extensive research [1]\u2013[4] for importance measures is available for the case when the system exhibits a binary functioning behavior.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "A simple method is given for calculating a) reliability characteristics of repairable and nonrepairable systems, and b) the importance of the individual system components.
