The method of weighted likelihood is applied to this problem, and a robust estimator of the exponential parameter is proposed. Interestingly, the proposed estimator is an /spl alpha/-trimmed mean type estimator. The large-sample robustness properties of the new estimator are examined. Further, a Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted showing that the proposed estimator is, under a wide range of contaminated exponential models, more efficient than the usual maximum likelihood estimator in the sense of having a smaller risk, a measure combining bias & variability. An application of the method to a data set on the failure times of throttles is presented."}, "references": [{"title": "Reliability: Modeling, Prediction and Optimization", "context": [{"text": "THE EXPONENTIAL distribution is the most commonly used model in reliability & life-testing analysis [1], [2].", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Here we consider a data set from [1] (also used by [10]) on the failure times of throttles.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781118150481", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "W.
