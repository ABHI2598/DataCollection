Following the current trend of shrinking device feature size & increasing die area, newer FPGA are more susceptible to radiation induced errors. Single event upsets (SEU), (also known as soft-errors) account for a considerable amount of radiation induced errors. SEU are difficult to detect & correct when they affect memory-elements present in the FPGA, which are used for the implementation of finite state machines (FSM). Conventional practice to improve FPGA design reliability in the presence of soft-errors is through configuration memory scrubbing, and through component redundancy. Configuration memory scrubbing, although suitable for combinatorial logic in an FPGA design, does not work for sequential blocks such as FSM. This is because the state-bits stored in flip-flops (FF) are variable, and change their value after each state transition. Component redundancy, which is also used to mitigate soft-errors, comes at the expense of significant area overhead, and increased power consumption compared to nonredundant designs. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach to implement the FSM using synchronous embedded memory blocks to enhance the runtime reliability without significant increase in power consumption. Experiments conducted on various benchmark FSM show that this approach has higher reliability, lower area overhead, and consumes less power compared to a component redundancy technique.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1505051", "xplore-issue": "32272", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32272", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Enhanced+reliability+of+finite-state+machines+in+FPGA+through+efficient+fault+detection+and+correction&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2005&author=A.+Tiwari&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.853438&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=459&endPage=467&volumeNum=54&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "21", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Field programmable gate arrays", "Fault detection", "Single event upset", "Redundancy", "Energy consumption", "Random access memory", "Automata", "Logic design", "Flip-flops", "Runtime"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["logic design", "SRAM chips", "field programmable gate arrays", "finite state machines", "fault tolerance", "combinational circuits", "flip-flops", "redundancy", "power consumption", "error detection", "fault diagnosis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["soft errors", "fault detection", "fault correction", "SRAM", "static RAM", "field programmable gate array", "FPGA", "ion radiation", "shrinking device", "single event upset", "finite state machines", "FSM", "reliability", "scrubbing", "combinatorial logic", "flip-flops", "component redundancy", "power consumption", "fault tolerance"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["soft errors", "Fault tolerant FPGA design", "FSM reliability", "single event upset (SEU)"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Enhanced reliability of finite-state machines in FPGA through efficient fault detection and correction", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8568684"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/32272/1505051", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "8", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "17 April 2012", "inventors": "Pothireddy, Anil; Ramalingam, Neranjen", "patentNumber": "8161366", "ipcClassList": "G06F0110000", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US8161366.pdf", "title": "FINITE STATE MACHINE ERROR RECOVERY", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "714814000", "pocClasses": ["714814000"], "filingDate": "03 December 2007", "id": "08161366", "patentAbstract": "A method and system for using a magnitude comparator circuit and a flag bit, for detecting and preventing errors from occurring in the FSM state bits that could otherwise cause the system to hang.
