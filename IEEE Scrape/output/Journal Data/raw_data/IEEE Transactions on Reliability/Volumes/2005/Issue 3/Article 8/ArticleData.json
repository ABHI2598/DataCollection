We first formulate the cost-constrained system reliability optimization problem as a searching process in a combinatorial tree, which enumerates all the possible solutions to the problem. Because the calculation of each possible solution for the reliability problem is extremely time-consuming, a novel algorithm, the Shrinking & Searching Algorithm (SSA), is proposed to speed up the searching process. SSA jointly considers the upper bound of the system reliability for each branch in the combinatorial tree, and the cost constraint on the possible solutions. It avoids most of the redundant calculations in the searching process by gradually shrinking the difference between lower & upper bounds of the length of a path in the corresponding combinatorial tree, which represents a feasible solution. Case study & simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the SSA.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1505047", "xplore-issue": "32272", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32272", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Reliability+optimization+of+distributed+access+networks+with+constrained+total+cost&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2005&author=+Fang-Ming+Shao&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.853440&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=421&endPage=430&volumeNum=54&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "19", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Constraint optimization", "Cost function", "Upper bound", "IP networks", "Telecommunication traffic", "Transceivers", "Multiplexing", "Reliability engineering", "Councils", "Wireless communication"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability theory", "computer network reliability", "subscriber loops", "optimisation", "combinatorial mathematics", "tree searching"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["branch and bound", "reliability optimization", "distributed access network", "cost-constrained system", "searching process", "combinatorial tree", "time-consuming solution", "shrinking &amp; searching algorithm"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["system reliability", "Branch and bound", "distributed access networks", "optimization"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability optimization of distributed access networks with constrained total cost", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8568680"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/32272/1505047", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Reliability optimization of distributed access networks with constrained total cost", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "The Bilevel Design Problem for Communication Networks on Trains: Model, Algorithm, and Verification", "displayText": "Yin Tian, Hong-hui Dong, Li-min Jia, Yong Qin, Si-yu Li, \"The Bilevel Design Problem for Communication Networks on Trains: Model Algorithm and Verification\", <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em>, vol. 2014, pp. 1, 2014, ISSN 1024-123X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/840619"}}, {"title": "Network reliability optimization problem of interconnection network under node-edge failure model", "displayText": "R.K.
