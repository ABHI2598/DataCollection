The context is machine monitoring when the following are true: 1) The machine can operate in one of N states in S/spl isin/{0,1,...,N-1} where 0 is good, 1 to N-2 represent increasing levels of deterioration (i.e., the system becomes increasingly worn, but is still able to produce usable parts), and N-1 is bad (or failed). 2) Observations are related probabilistically to the state of the process. 3) The machine's state is known with certainty only immediately after a replacement. The last assumption, consistent with \"silent\" failures, distinguishes our results from others. We prove [using the theory & results of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP)] that the policy that minimizes the total expected cost of system maintenance has a \"marginally monotonic\" structure. The concept of \"marginal monotonicity\", which requires a component-wise partial ordering, and monotonicity of the expected total cost function with respect to each component of the state space, allows characterization of the policy that minimizes the total expected cost. This feature allows us to represent the optimal policy by a collection of decision rules characterized by at most N functions.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1505054", "xplore-issue": "32272", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32272", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Marginally+monotonic+maintenance+policies+for+a+multi-state+deteriorating+machine+with+probabilistic+monitoring%2C+and+silent+failures&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2005&author=J.S.+Ivy&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.853443&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=489&endPage=497&volumeNum=54&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "16", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Condition monitoring", "Cost function", "Production systems", "Manufacturing industries", "Inspection", "Maintenance", "State-space methods", "Probability density function", "Quality management", "Medical services"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["decision making", "reliability theory", "maintenance engineering", "condition monitoring", "cost reduction", "optimisation", "Markov processes", "manufacturing systems"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["threshold policy", "monotonic maintenance policy", "multi-state deteriorating machine", "probabilistic monitoring", "machine monitoring", "cost reduction", "optimization", "partially observable Markov decision processes"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["threshold policy", "Maintenance", "maintenance cost optimization", "monotonic structure", "partially observable Markov decision process"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Marginally monotonic maintenance policies for a multi-state deteriorating machine with probabilistic monitoring, and silent failures", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8568687"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/32272/1505054", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Marginally monotonic maintenance policies for a multi-state deteriorating machine with probabilistic monitoring, and silent failures", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "A Markov decision process model case for optimal maintenance of serially dependent power system components", "displayText": "Daniel Bumblauskas, \"A Markov decision process model case for optimal maintenance of serially dependent power system components\", <em>Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering</em>, vol. 21, pp. 271, 2015, ISSN 1355-2511.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JQME-09-2014-0050"}}, {"title": "Wiley Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science", "displayText": "Emine Yaylali, Julie S.
