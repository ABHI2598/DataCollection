The last assumption, consistent with \"silent\" failures, distinguishes our results from others. We prove [using the theory & results of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP)] that the policy that minimizes the total expected cost of system maintenance has a \"marginally monotonic\" structure. The concept of \"marginal monotonicity\", which requires a component-wise partial ordering, and monotonicity of the expected total cost function with respect to each component of the state space, allows characterization of the policy that minimizes the total expected cost. This feature allows us to represent the optimal policy by a collection of decision rules characterized by at most N functions."}, "references": [{"title": "Some maintenance models and availability with imperfect maintenance in production systems", "context": [{"text": " Indeed, system deterioration is often reflected in higher production costs, and lower product quality 1.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018910109348", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "H.
