The resulting general statistical model gives an accelerated test form of the inverse Gaussian distribution, special cases of which include some existing models in addition to several new models. Model parameterizations & estimation by maximum likelihood from accelerated test data are discussed, and the applicability of the general model is illustrated for three sets of strength data.
