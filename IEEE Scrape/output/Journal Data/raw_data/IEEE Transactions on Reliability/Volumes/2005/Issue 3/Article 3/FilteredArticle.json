In particular, we extend the Taguchi method for robust design by computing the entropy of the percent contribution values of the noise factors. The new measures are computed already at the parameter-design stage, and together with the traditional S/N ratios enable the specification of a robust design. Assuming that (some of) the noise factors should be naturalized, the entropy of a design reflects the potential efforts that will be required in the tolerance-design stage to reach a more reliable system. Using a small example, we illustrate the contribution of the new measure that might alter the designer decision in comparison with the traditional Taguchi method, and ultimately obtain a system with a lower quality loss. Assuming that the percent contribution values can reflect the probability of a noise factor to trigger a disturbance in the system response, a series of probabilistic algorithms can be applied to the robust design problem. We focus on the Huffman coding algorithm, and show how to implement this algorithm such that the designer obtains the minimal expected number of tests in order to find the disturbing noise factor. The entropy measure, in this case, provides the lower bound on the algorithm's performance."}, "references": [{"title": "Off-line and on-line quality control systems", "context": [{"text": "THE MAIN objective in the Taguchi method [1]\u2013\n[3], is to design robust systems which are reliable under uncontrollable conditions.", "sec": "sec1a", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Taguchi characterized three types of quality loss functions for a given system [1]\u2013[3]:\n\ni)nominal-the-best is where the designer wants to achieve a particular target value, for example, a required output voltage of a circuit.\nii)smaller-the-better is where the designer wants to minimize the system response because quality decrease as the system response increases.", "sec": "sec1b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The outer array deliberately introduces a systematic noise during the experiment to identify the design configurations that are less sensitive to the noise [1], [3].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "G.
