In particular, we extend the Taguchi method for robust design by computing the entropy of the percent contribution values of the noise factors. The new measures are computed already at the parameter-design stage, and together with the traditional S/N ratios enable the specification of a robust design. Assuming that (some of) the noise factors should be naturalized, the entropy of a design reflects the potential efforts that will be required in the tolerance-design stage to reach a more reliable system. Using a small example, we illustrate the contribution of the new measure that might alter the designer decision in comparison with the traditional Taguchi method, and ultimately obtain a system with a lower quality loss. Assuming that the percent contribution values can reflect the probability of a noise factor to trigger a disturbance in the system response, a series of probabilistic algorithms can be applied to the robust design problem. We focus on the Huffman coding algorithm, and show how to implement this algorithm such that the designer obtains the minimal expected number of tests in order to find the disturbing noise factor. The entropy measure, in this case, provides the lower bound on the algorithm's performance.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1505042", "xplore-issue": "32272", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32272", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=On+the+use+of+data+compression+measures+to+analyze+robust+designs&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2005&author=I.+Ben-Gal&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.853280&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=381&endPage=388&volumeNum=54&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "11", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Data compression", "Noise robustness", "Entropy", "Control systems", "Noise measurement", "Huffman coding", "System testing", "Design methodology", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Robust control"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["Taguchi methods", "data compression", "reliability", "Huffman codes", "probability", "entropy codes"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["control factor", "data compression", "robust design", "entropy", "Huffman coding", "noise factor", "reliability", "Taguchi method", "S-N ratio", "tolerance-design stage", "probability", "probabilistic algorithm"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["Taguchi method", "Compression rate", "control &amp;amp; noise factors", "entropy", "experimentation", "performance measure", "robust designs", "S/N ratio"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "On the use of data compression measures to analyze robust designs", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8568675"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/32272/1505042", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "On the use of data compression measures to analyze robust designs", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Optimization of Process Parameter for Sawdust/Recycled Polyethylene Composites", "displayText": "Clement U.
