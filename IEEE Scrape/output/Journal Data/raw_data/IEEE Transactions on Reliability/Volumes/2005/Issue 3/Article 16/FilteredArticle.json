For instance, in the assessment of fault tolerant systems, metrics such as the reliability, R(t) and the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) are well-accepted as a means to quantify the fault tolerant attributes of a system with an associated failure rate, /spl lambda/. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a consensus on comparable metrics to use in the assessment of safety-critical systems. The objective of this paper is to develop two metrics that can be used in the assessment of safety-critical systems, the steady-state safety, S/sub ss/, and the Mean Time To Unsafe Failure (MTTUF). S/sub ss/ represents the evaluation of the safety as a function of time, in the limiting case as time approaches infinity. The MTTUF represents the average or mean time that a system will operate safely before a failure that produces an unsafe system state. A 3-state Markov model is used to model a safety-critical system with the transition rates computed as a function of the system coverage C/sub sys/, and the hazard rate /spl lambda/(t). Also, /spl lambda/(t) is defined by the Weibull distribution, primarily because it allows one to easily represent the scenarios where the failure rate is increasing, decreasing, and constant. The results of the paper demonstrate that conservative estimates for lower bounds for both S/sub ss/ & the MTTUF result when C/sub sys/ is assumed to be a constant regardless of the behavior of /spl lambda/(t). The derived results are then used to evaluate three example systems."}, "references": [{"title": "Defining mean time-to-failure in a particular failure-state for multi-failure-state systems", "context": [{"text": "As a final example, consider the 1-out-of-2 system analyzed in [1].", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}, {"text": " This 1-out-of-2 system is included here because the MTTUF of this system is estimated in [1] using a very different method than presented in this paper.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}, {"text": " This result is then compared to the MTTUF estimate published in [1].", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}, {"text": "\nGraphs of the safety, and reliability for a one of two systems described in [1]\n\n\nThe MTTUF is also calculated in [1] using a technique that is based on manipulating the absorbing states of the Markov model, and this result is given asNotice that the two results are almost identical; that is, they differ by approximately \\$0.7\\times 10^{-3}\\%\\$.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}, {"text": " One advantage of the technique presented in this paper versus the technique presented in [1] is that MTTUF is calculated using standard dependability metrics \\$S(t)\\$ & \\$R(t)\\$, and not the manipulation of Markov models.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}, {"text": " With the presented technique, safety and/or reliability engineers can estimate MTTUF by using any reliability & safety modeling technique, while the Bukowski & Goble method [1] requires a Markov model.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "In multi-failure-state systems which have both dangerous (critical) and safe (noncritical) failure states, it is both meaningful and important to be able to measure the MTTF in a particular failure state separately from MTTF in general.
