For instance, in the assessment of fault tolerant systems, metrics such as the reliability, R(t) and the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) are well-accepted as a means to quantify the fault tolerant attributes of a system with an associated failure rate, /spl lambda/. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a consensus on comparable metrics to use in the assessment of safety-critical systems. The objective of this paper is to develop two metrics that can be used in the assessment of safety-critical systems, the steady-state safety, S/sub ss/, and the Mean Time To Unsafe Failure (MTTUF). S/sub ss/ represents the evaluation of the safety as a function of time, in the limiting case as time approaches infinity. The MTTUF represents the average or mean time that a system will operate safely before a failure that produces an unsafe system state. A 3-state Markov model is used to model a safety-critical system with the transition rates computed as a function of the system coverage C/sub sys/, and the hazard rate /spl lambda/(t). Also, /spl lambda/(t) is defined by the Weibull distribution, primarily because it allows one to easily represent the scenarios where the failure rate is increasing, decreasing, and constant. The results of the paper demonstrate that conservative estimates for lower bounds for both S/sub ss/ & the MTTUF result when C/sub sys/ is assumed to be a constant regardless of the behavior of /spl lambda/(t). The derived results are then used to evaluate three example systems.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1505055", "xplore-issue": "32272", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32272", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Dependability+metrics+to+assess+safety-critical+systems&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2005&author=T.A.+DeLong&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.853567&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=498&endPage=505&volumeNum=54&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "25", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Safety", "Hazards", "Fault tolerant systems", "Steady-state", "Reliability engineering", "Weibull distribution", "Time measurement", "Military computing", "Analytical models", "H infinity control"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["safety systems", "fault tolerance", "failure analysis", "Markov processes", "Weibull distribution"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["steady-state safety", "dependability metrics", "safety systems", "fault tolerant systems", "reliability", "mean time to failure", "MTTF", "failure analysis", "Markov model", "Weibull distribution"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["steady-state safety", "Coverage", "Markov model", "mean time to unsafe failure", "safety"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Dependability metrics to assess safety-critical systems", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8568688"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/32272/1505055", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Dependability metrics to assess safety-critical systems", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "SAFETY ASSESSMENT FOR SAFETY-CRITICAL SYSTEMS USING MARKOV CHAIN MODULAR APPROACH", "displayText": "YANGYANG YU, BARRY W.
