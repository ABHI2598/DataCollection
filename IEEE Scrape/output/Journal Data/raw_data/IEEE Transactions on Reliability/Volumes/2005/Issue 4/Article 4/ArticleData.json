The characteristics of the 2-EBP model are discussed, and the physical meaning of its parameters is derived. The 2-EBP model can be viewed as a dynamic power law process, whose shape parameter ranges from 2 to 1 as the system age increases, converging asymptotically to the homogeneous Poisson process. Maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters & other quantities of interest, as well as a testing procedure (based on the likelihood ratio statistic) for time trend, are provided. Numerical applications are given to illustrate the 2-EBP model & the related inferential procedures, and to emphasize on the caution to use in assuming the (very often used) power law process when the presence of a finite bound for the failure intensity is conjecturable.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1546564", "xplore-issue": "33008", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33008", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+new+model+for+repairable+systems+with+bounded+failure+intensity&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2005&author=L.+Attardi&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2005.858465&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=572&endPage=582&volumeNum=54&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "19", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Power system modeling", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Failure analysis", "Power system reliability", "Shape", "Cost function", "Data analysis", "Mathematical model", "Aerodynamics", "Parameter estimation"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["numerical analysis", "maintenance engineering", "reliability theory", "maximum likelihood estimation", "failure analysis", "stochastic processes"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["optimal maintenance interval", "repairable system", "bounded failure intensity", "2-parameter Engelhardt-Bain process", "failure pattern", "reliability deterioration", "power law process", "homogeneous Poisson process", "maximum likelihood estimate", "likelihood ratio statistic", "numerical analysis", "bounded intensity function"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["repairable systems", "Bounded intensity function", "maximum likelihood estimate", "optimal maintenance interval", "reliability deterioration"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2005", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A new model for repairable systems with bounded failure intensity", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "54", "accessionNumber": "8675632"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/33008/1546564", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A new model for repairable systems with bounded failure intensity", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Bayesian Prediction of the Overhaul Effect on a Repairable Systemwith Bounded Failure Intensity", "displayText": "Preeti Wanti Srivastava, Nidhi Jain, \"Bayesian Prediction of the Overhaul Effect on a Repairable Systemwith Bounded Failure Intensity\", <em>International Journal of Quality Statistics and Reliability</em>, vol. 2011, pp. 1, 2011, ISSN 1687-7144.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2011/681210"}}, {"title": "Generalized Confidence Interval for the Scale Parameter of the Power-Law Process", "displayText": "Bing Xing Wang, Min Xie, Jun Xing Zhou, \"Generalized Confidence Interval for the Scale Parameter of the Power-Law Process\", <em>Communications in Statistics -
