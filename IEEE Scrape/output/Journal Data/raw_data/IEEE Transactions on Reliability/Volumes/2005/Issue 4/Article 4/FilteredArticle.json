The characteristics of the 2-EBP model are discussed, and the physical meaning of its parameters is derived. The 2-EBP model can be viewed as a dynamic power law process, whose shape parameter ranges from 2 to 1 as the system age increases, converging asymptotically to the homogeneous Poisson process. Maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters & other quantities of interest, as well as a testing procedure (based on the likelihood ratio statistic) for time trend, are provided. Numerical applications are given to illustrate the 2-EBP model & the related inferential procedures, and to emphasize on the caution to use in assuming the (very often used) power law process when the presence of a finite bound for the failure intensity is conjecturable."}, "references": [{"title": "The Statistical Analysis of Series of Events.", "context": [{"text": " Models able to describe such a behavior are several NHPP; among them, the log-linear process 1, and the PLP 2 are well known.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-7801-3", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "D.
