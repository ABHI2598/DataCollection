The first problem is to minimize the number of remaining faults given a fixed amount of testing-effort, and a reliability objective. The second problem is to minimize the amount of testing-effort given the number of remaining faults, and a reliability objective. We have proposed several strategies for module testing to help software project managers solve these problems, and make the best decisions. We provide several systematic solutions based on a nonhomogeneous Poisson process model, allowing systematic allocation of a specified amount of testing-resource expenditures for each software module under some constraints. We describe several numerical examples on the optimal testing-resource allocation problems to show applications & impacts of the proposed strategies during module testing. Experimental results indicate the advantages of the approaches we proposed in guiding software engineers & project managers toward best testing resource allocation in practice. Finally, an extensive sensitivity analysis is presented to investigate the effects of various principal parameters on the optimization problem of testing-resource allocation. The results can help us know which parameters have the most significant influence, and the changes of optimal testing-effort expenditures affected by the variations of fault detection rate & expected initial faults."}, "references": [{"title": "Handbook of Software Reliability Engineering", "context": [{"text": " According to the ANSI definition: \u201cSoftware reliability is defined as the probability of failure-free software operation for a specified period of time in a specified environment\u201d [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Many Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGM) were developed in the 1970s\u20132000s [1], [2].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "A number of SRGM have been proposed on the subject of software reliability [1].", "sec": "sec2a", "part": "1"}, {"text": " In [28], we extended the logistic TEF to a generalized form, and the generalized logistic TEF is formulated asThe current TE consumption isThe TE reaches its maximum value at timeThe conditional reliability function after the last failure occurs at time \\$t\\$ is obtained by [1], [2]Taking the logarithm on both sides of the above equation, we obtain.", "sec": "sec2a", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Two most popular estimation techniques are Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and Least Squares Estimation (LSE) [1], [2], [26].", "sec": "sec2b", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "M.
