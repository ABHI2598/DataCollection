A feedback control approach is proposed which enables tradeoffs between the failure cost of a compromised information system and the maintenance cost of ongoing defensive countermeasures. Online implementation features an inexpensive computation architecture consisting of a sensor-driven recursive estimator followed by an estimate-driven response selector. Offline design features a systematic empirical procedure utilizing a suite of mathematical modeling and numerical optimization tools. The engineering challenge is to generate domain models and decision strategies offline via tractable methods, while achieving online effectiveness. We illustrate the approach with experimentation results for a prototype autonomic defense system which protects its host, a Linux-based web-server, against an automated Internet worm attack. The overall approach applies to other types of computer attacks, network-level security and other domains which could benefit from automatic decision-making based on a sequence of sensor measurements."}, "references": [{"title": "CERT/CC Statistics 1988&#8212001", "context": [{"text": "THE increasing reliance on information systems within critical military and civilian operations coupled with the proliferation of malicious intrusive activity [1] motivates continued improvements in computer security.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "<em>CERT/CC Statistics 1988&#8212001</em>, 2002, CERT Coordination Center,  [online]  Available: .", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "An Analysis of Security Incidents on the Internet 1989&#8211995", "context": [{"text": " Malicious intrusions can be described at many levels, including in terms of information system impact (e.g., denial of service, theft of service, etc [2]) or in terms of attacker objectives (e.g., defacing a government web server in order to make a political statement).", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Table Ioutlines an Internet worm's generic steps grouped into separate phases according to the sub-objectives of the attack sequence [2].", "sec": "sec3a", "part": "1"}], "order": "2", "id": "ref2", "text": "J.
