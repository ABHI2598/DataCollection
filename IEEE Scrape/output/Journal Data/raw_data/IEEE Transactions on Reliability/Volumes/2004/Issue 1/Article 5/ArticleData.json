We provide an asymptotic statistical test for the cumulative exposure model based on the grouped and type I censored data. We also present the optimum test plan for a simple step-stress test when the lifetime under constant stress is assumed exponential. Finally we give an application of our methods by applying our analysis process to a real life data set.
