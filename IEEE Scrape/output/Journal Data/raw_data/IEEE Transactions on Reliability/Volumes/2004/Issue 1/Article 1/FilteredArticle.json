Specifications define materials & processes, performance, quality assurance, and packaging of everything from nuts & bolts to weapons systems, and handkerchiefs to gunpowder. Standards identify preferred or acceptable materials, processes, and procedures. Handbooks contain compilations of data regarding particular subjects. The US Military Specification and Standards system was modified as part of the DoD Acquisition Reform program, resulting in cancellation of many of the specifications, standards, handbooks, and supporting documents."}, "references": [], "citations": {"paperCitations": {}, "patentCitationCount": "0", "contentType": "periodicals", "isEarlyAccess": false, "lastupdate": "2015-06-19T20:48:02", "publisher": "IEEE", "title": "Opinion item: cancelled US-military specifications", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Opinion item: cancelled US-military specifications", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/28639/1282154", "mlTime": "PT0.022478S", "ieeeCitationCount": "0"}}
