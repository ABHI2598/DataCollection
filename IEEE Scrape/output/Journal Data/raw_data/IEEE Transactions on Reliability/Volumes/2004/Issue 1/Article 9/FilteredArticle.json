The cut-set method is a popular approach in the reliability analysis of many systems from simple to complex configurations. The computational requirements necessary to determine the minimal cut-sets of a network depend mainly on the number of minimal paths between the source and the sink. A technique designated as the \"Path Tracing Algorithm\" is presented in this paper, which can handle both simple and complex networks, and considers both unidirectional and bi-directional branches. A step by step procedure is explained using a bridge-network. The algorithm is easy to program, and does not require limits on the size of the network. The applicability of the proposed technique is illustrated by application to a more complicated system."}, "references": [{"title": "Probabilistic Risk Assessment and Management for Engineers and Scientists", "context": [{"text": " A range of reliability measures are described in the literature [1]\u2013[5].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "H.
