A feedback control approach is proposed which enables tradeoffs between the failure cost of a compromised information system and the maintenance cost of ongoing defensive countermeasures. Online implementation features an inexpensive computation architecture consisting of a sensor-driven recursive estimator followed by an estimate-driven response selector. Offline design features a systematic empirical procedure utilizing a suite of mathematical modeling and numerical optimization tools. The engineering challenge is to generate domain models and decision strategies offline via tractable methods, while achieving online effectiveness. We illustrate the approach with experimentation results for a prototype autonomic defense system which protects its host, a Linux-based web-server, against an automated Internet worm attack. The overall approach applies to other types of computer attacks, network-level security and other domains which could benefit from automatic decision-making based on a sequence of sensor measurements.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1282171", "xplore-issue": "28639", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=28639", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Feedback+control+applied+to+survivability%3A+a+host-based+autonomic+defense+system&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2004&author=O.P.+Kreidl&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.824833&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=148&endPage=166&volumeNum=53&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "28", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Feedback control", "Information systems", "Costs", "Recursive estimation", "Maintenance", "Computer architecture", "Mathematical model", "Design optimization", "Design engineering", "Prototypes"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["numerical analysis", "information systems", "computer network reliability", "security of data", "recursive estimation", "decision making", "Markov processes", "Internet", "feedback"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["stochastic control", "feedback control", "host-based autonomic defense system", "information system survivability", "computational performance", "malicious intrusive activity", "failure cost", "maintenance cost", "computation architecture", "sensor-driven recursive estimator", "mathematical modeling", "numerical optimization tools", "domain models", "decision strategies", "tractable methods", "Linux-based web-server", "computer attacks", "network-level security", "automatic decision-making", "computer security", "empirical methods", "intrusion tolerance", "Markovian processes", "sensor uncertainty"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Feedback control applied to survivability: a host-based autonomic defense system", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "7966388"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/28639/1282171", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "1", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "22 April 2008", "inventors": "Frazier, Tiffany M.; Kreidl, O.
