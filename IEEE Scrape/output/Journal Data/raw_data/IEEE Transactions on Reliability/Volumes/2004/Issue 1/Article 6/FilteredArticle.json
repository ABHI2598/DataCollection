Further, the requirement for high reliability increases the need for test procedures which yield valuable degradation and other useful information for improving product reliability. Thus in some manufacturing and other experiments, various types of failure censored and accelerated life tests are commonly employed for life testing. In this paper we discuss Type I progressively censored variable-sampling plans for Weibull lifetime distributions under competing causes of failure. The proposed procedure is attractive as it yields useful degradation-related information for improving product quality. In addition, the procedure is useful when a test is conducted under severe time constraint and/or when the experimenter wishes to save costly specimens or scarce test facilities for other use."}, "references": [{"title": "Progressively censored samples in life testing", "context": [{"text": " Articles by Cohen [1], Mann [2] and Lemon [3] are some early works on estimation under progressive censoring.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1266337", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "A.
