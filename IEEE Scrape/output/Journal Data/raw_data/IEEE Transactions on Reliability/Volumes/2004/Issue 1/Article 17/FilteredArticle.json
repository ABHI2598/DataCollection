Automatic discovery of masqueraders is sometimes undertaken by detecting significant departures from normal user behavior, as represented by a user profile formed from system audit data. A major obstacle for this type of research is the difficulty in obtaining such system audit data, largely due to privacy concerns. An immense contribution in this regard has been made by Schonlau et al., who have made available UNIX command-line data from 50+ users collected over a number of months. Most of the research in this area has made use of this dataset, so this paper takes as its point of departure the Schonlau et al. dataset and a recent series of experiments with this data framed by the same researchers . In extending that work with a new classification algorithm, a 56% improvement in masquerade detection was achieved at a corresponding false-alarm rate of 1.3%. In addition, encouraging results were obtained at a more realistic sequence length of 10 commands (as opposed to sequences of 100 commands used by Schonlau et al.). A detailed error analysis, based on an alternative configuration of the same data, reveals a serious flaw in this type of data which hinders masquerade detection and indicates some steps that need to be taken to improve future results. The error analysis also demonstrates the insights that can be gained by inspecting decision errors, instead of concentrating only on decision successes."}, "references": [{"title": "Computer intrusion: Detecting masquerades", "context": [{"text": " A nice collection of such work, in which a number of masquerade-detection techniques were applied to the same data set, is presented by Schonlau and his colleagues [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The most recent research in masquerade detection has been based on the Schonlau et al. dataset, which consists exclusively of UNIX user commands [1].", "sec": "sec2", "part": "1"}, {"text": " This dataset formed the basis for experimentation by several researchers using a number of masquerade-detection techniques, the results of which were published as a compendium in [1].", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}, {"text": " [1] compared the performance of six masquerade-detection algorithms (some new, others drawn from the computer science literature) on the data described above.", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Uniqueness was a poor performer in terms of detecting masqueraders (39.4%), but it was the only method able to approach the target false alarm rate of 1% (1.4%) [1].", "sec": "sec3a", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The implementation of this model in [1] actually toggled between a Markov model and a simple independence model, depending on the proportion of commands in the test data that had not been observed in the training data.", "sec": "sec3c", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The idea behind the compression approach is that new data from the same user should compress at about the same ratio as old data from that user, whilst data from a masquerading user will compress at a different ratio and thereby be distinguished from the legitimate user.
