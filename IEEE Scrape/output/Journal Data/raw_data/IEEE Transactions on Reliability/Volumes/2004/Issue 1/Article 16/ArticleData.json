This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test technique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1282169", "xplore-issue": "28639", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=28639", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Robustness+of+the+Markov-chain+model+for+cyber-attack+detection&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2004&author=+Nong+Ye&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.823851&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=116&endPage=123&volumeNum=53&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "57", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Computer networks", "Noise robustness", "Noise level", "Testing", "Computer security", "Machine learning", "Inference algorithms", "Operating systems", "Stochastic processes", "Intrusion detection"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["inference mechanisms", "Markov processes", "telecommunication security", "computer networks", "performance evaluation", "learning (artificial intelligence)"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["window size", "Markov-chain model", "cyber-attack detection", "computer-event transitions", "learning algorithms", "inference algorithms", "anomaly-detection technique", "computer audit data", "Solaris operating system", "stochastic process", "intrusion detection", "chi-square distance test technique", "noise level", "computer security", "activity-data quality"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "7966386"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/28639/1282169", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "3", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "01 December 2015", "inventors": "Casillas, Debra; Davey, Richard Andrew; Morris, Michael Frank; Mortensen, Maland Keith; Row, John David; Buckingham, Thomas; Sanclemente, Tammy", "order": "1", "patentNumber": "9203860", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US9203860.pdf", "title": "Dynamic risk engine", "assignees": ["UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION (USAA)"], "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9203860.PN.&OS=PN/9203860", "filingDate": "20 March 2012", "id": "09203860", "patentAbstract": "Various embodiments of the present invention generally relate to identity authentication and/or recognition.

The method uses cascaded k-Means clustering and the ID3 decision tree learning methods to characterize a training data set having data points with known characterization. The k-Means clustering method first partitions the training instances into k clusters using Euclidean distance similarity. On each training cluster, representing a density region of normal or anomaly instances, the invention builds an ID3 decision tree. The decision tree on each cluster refines the decision boundaries by learning the sub-groups within the cluster. A test data point is then subjected to the clustering and decision trees constructed form the training instances. To obtain a final decision on classification, the decisions of the k-Means and ID3 methods are combined using rules: (1) the Nearest-neighbor rule, and (2) the Nearest-consensus rule. </p>", "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7792770.PN.&OS=PN/7792770", "assignees": ["LOUISIANA TECH RESEARCH FOUNDATION A DIVISION OF LOUISIANA TECH UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION INC"], "ipcClasses": ["G06N0050000"], "appNum": "12072252"}], "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Intrusion detection based on the second-order stochastic model", "displayText": "Xiaoqiang Zhang, Zhongliang Zhu, Pingzhi Fan, \"Intrusion detection based on the second-order stochastic model\", <em>Journal of Electronics (China)</em>, vol. 24, pp. 679, 2007, ISSN 0217-9822.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11767-006-0046-0"}}, {"title": "An efficient network intrusion detection", "displayText": "Chia-Mei Chen, Ya-Lin Chen, Hsiao-Chung Lin, \"An efficient network intrusion detection\", <em>Computer Communications</em>, vol. 33, pp. 477, 2010, ISSN 01403664.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2009.10.010"}}, {"title": "Multi-Agent-Based Anomaly Intrusion Detection", "displayText": "J.
