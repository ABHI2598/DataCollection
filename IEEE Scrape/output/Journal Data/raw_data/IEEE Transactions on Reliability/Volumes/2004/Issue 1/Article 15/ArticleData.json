Various ACS have been designed & implemented. However, there are few formal & quantitative analyzes on how these systems perform. System developers argue the security goals which their systems can achieve. Such results are vague & not persuasive. This paper uses a probabilistic method to investigate the anonymity behavior of ACS. In particular, this paper studies the probability that the true identity of a sender can be discovered in an ACS, given that some nodes have been compromised. It is through this analysis that design guidelines can be identified for systems aimed at providing communication anonymity. For example, contrary to what one would intuitively expect, these analytic results show that the probability that the true identity of a sender can be discovered might not always decrease as the length of communication path increases.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1282168", "xplore-issue": "28639", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=28639", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+quantitative+analysis+of+anonymous+communications&isbn=&publicationDate=March+2004&author=+Yong+Guan&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.824826&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=103&endPage=115&volumeNum=53&issueNum=1", "citationCount": "9", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Internet", "Protection", "Communication system security", "Electronic voting", "Performance analysis", "Guidelines", "Electronic mail", "Protocols", "Computer science education", "Educational programs"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["probability", "telecommunication security", "telecommunication network routing"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["receiver anonymity", "quantitative analysis", "anonymous communication systems", "anonymity properties", "probabilistic method", "network security", "rerouting", "sender anonymity"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "1", "chronOrPublicationDate": "March 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A quantitative analysis of anonymous communications", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "7966385"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/28639/1282168", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A quantitative analysis of anonymous communications", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Survey on anonymous communications in computer networks", "displayText": "Jian Ren, Jie Wu, \"Survey on anonymous communications in computer networks\", <em>Computer Communications</em>, vol. 33, pp. 420, 2010, ISSN 01403664.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2009.11.009"}}, {"title": "Survey on Anonymity in Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Systems", "displayText": "Ren-Yi Xiao, \"Survey on Anonymity in Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Systems\", <em>Journal of Computer Science and Technology</em>, vol. 23, pp. 660, 2008, ISSN 18604749.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11390-008-9162-7"}}], "ieee": [{"title": "An Analysis of Onion-Based Anonymous Routing for Delay Tolerant Networks", "displayText": "Kazuya Sakai, Min-Te Sun, Wei-Shinn Ku, Jie Wu, Faisal S.
