This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test technique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study."}, "references": [{"title": "Network and Inter-network Security Principles and Practice", "context": [{"text": " As there is increasing reliance on computer and network systems to support critical operations in defense, banking, telecommunication, transportation, electric power, et al., cyber-attacks have become an important threat to our society with potentially severe consequences [1]\u2013[10].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "W.

The method uses cascaded k-Means clustering and the ID3 decision tree learning methods to characterize a training data set having data points with known characterization. The k-Means clustering method first partitions the training instances into k clusters using Euclidean distance similarity. On each training cluster, representing a density region of normal or anomaly instances, the invention builds an ID3 decision tree. The decision tree on each cluster refines the decision boundaries by learning the sub-groups within the cluster. A test data point is then subjected to the clustering and decision trees constructed form the training instances. To obtain a final decision on classification, the decisions of the k-Means and ID3 methods are combined using rules: (1) the Nearest-neighbor rule, and (2) the Nearest-consensus rule. </p>", "title": "METHOD TO INDENTIFY ANOMALOUS DATA USING CASCADED K MEANS CLUSTERING AND AN ID3 DECISION TREE", "patentNumber": "7792770", "filingDate": "25 February 2008", "assignees": ["LOUISIANA TECH RESEARCH FOUNDATION A DIVISION OF LOUISIANA TECH UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION INC"], "ipcClasses": ["G06N0050000"], "grantDate": "07 September 2010", "inventors": "Phoha, Vir V.; Balagani, Kiran S.", "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7792770.PN.&OS=PN/7792770", "pocClasses": ["706045000"], "pocClassList": "706045000", "order": "3"}], "lastupdate": "2016-08-04T13:29:18", "isEarlyAccess": false, "publisher": "IEEE", "title": "Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "29", "publicationNumber": "24", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/28639/1282169", "mlTime": "PT0.27139S", "ieeeCitationCount": "28"}}
