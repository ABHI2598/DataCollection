Various ACS have been designed & implemented. However, there are few formal & quantitative analyzes on how these systems perform. System developers argue the security goals which their systems can achieve. Such results are vague & not persuasive. This paper uses a probabilistic method to investigate the anonymity behavior of ACS. In particular, this paper studies the probability that the true identity of a sender can be discovered in an ACS, given that some nodes have been compromised. It is through this analysis that design guidelines can be identified for systems aimed at providing communication anonymity. For example, contrary to what one would intuitively expect, these analytic results show that the probability that the true identity of a sender can be discovered might not always decrease as the length of communication path increases."}, "references": [{"title": "The Anonymizer", "context": [{"text": "This section surveys the past work related to anonymity, including DC-Net [5], [39], Mixes [4], [18], [20], Anonymizer [1], Anonymous Remailer [2], LPWA [10], Onion Routing [13], [31], [33], [34], Crowds [26], Hordes [28], Freedom [12], and PipeNet [8].", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Anonymizer [1] provides fast, anonymous, interactive communication services.", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "<em>The Anonymizer</em>,  [online]  Available: .", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Anonymous Remailer", "context": [{"text": "This section surveys the past work related to anonymity, including DC-Net [5], [39], Mixes [4], [18], [20], Anonymizer [1], Anonymous Remailer [2], LPWA [10], Onion Routing [13], [31], [33], [34], Crowds [26], Hordes [28], Freedom [12], and PipeNet [8].", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Anonymous Remailer [2] is mainly used for e-mail anonymity.", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}], "order": "2", "id": "ref2", "text": "<em>Anonymous Remailer</em>,  [online]  Available: .", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Project anonymity and unobservability in the Internet", "context": [], "order": "3", "links": {"acmLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/332186.332211", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref3", "text": "O.
