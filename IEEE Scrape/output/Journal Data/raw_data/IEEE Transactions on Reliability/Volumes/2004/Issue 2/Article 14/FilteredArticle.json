The fundamental observation supporting the proposed methodology is that the inherent transparency behavior of RTL components, typically utilized for hierarchical off-line test, renders rich sources of invariance within a circuit. Furthermore, additional sources of invariance are obtained by examining the algorithmic interaction between the controller, and the datapath of the circuit. A judicious selection & combination of modular transparency functions, based on the algorithm implemented by the controller-datapath pair, yields a powerful set of invariant paths in a design. Compliance to the invariant behavior is checked whenever the latter is activated. Thus, such paths enable a simple, yet very efficient concurrent test capability, achieving fault security in excess of 90% while keeping the hardware overhead below 40% on complicated, difficult-to-test, sequential benchmark circuits. By exploiting fine-grained design invariance, the proposed methodology enhances circuit reliability, and contributes a low-cost concurrent test direction, applicable to general RTL circuits."}, "references": [{"title": "On-line testing for VLSI&#821A compendium of approaches", "context": [{"text": "Current state-of-the-art efforts in concurrent & on-line test research [1] can be roughly categorized in 2 main directions, as shown in Fig. 1.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008244815697", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "M.
