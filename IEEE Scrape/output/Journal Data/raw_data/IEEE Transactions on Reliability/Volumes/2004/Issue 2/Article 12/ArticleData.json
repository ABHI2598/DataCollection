For instance, for automobiles the chronological age & the total number of driving hours, as measures of usage, are good candidates for the time scale. An impact of a random usage on some properties of time to failure distribution functions is studied. It is shown that a random usage can change the shape of the failure rate of an object compared with the shape of the failure rate for the deterministic usage. Specifically, the sharply increasing failure rate can turn into a decreasing one, which is, in fact, surprising. The random usage can also change the aging properties of distributions under consideration, and this should be taken into account in applications. Several simple examples illustrate the developed concept.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1308671", "xplore-issue": "29043", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29043", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Alternative+time+scales+for+systems+with+random+usage&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2004&author=M.S.+Finkelstein&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.829155&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=261&endPage=264&volumeNum=53&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "7", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Automobiles", "Time measurement", "Aging", "Stochastic processes", "Shape", "Warranties", "Distribution functions", "Statistics", "Africa"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["reliability", "time measurement", "automobiles", "statistical distributions", "failure analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["scale transformation", "alternative time scale", "random usage", "reliability application", "failure time", "object performance", "automobile", "chronological age", "failure distribution function", "failure rate", "deterministic usage", "distribution mixture"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Alternative time scales for systems with random usage", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "8027397"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29043/1308671", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Alternative time scales for systems with random usage", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "On some properties of shock processes in a \u2018natural\u2019 scale", "displayText": "Ji Hwan Cha, Maxim Finkelstein, \"On some properties of shock processes in a \u2018natural\u2019 scale\", <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety</em>, vol. 145, pp. 104, 2016, ISSN 09518320.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2015.09.009"}}, {"title": "\u2018Time-free\u2019 preventive maintenance of systems with structures described by signatures", "displayText": "Maxim Finkelstein, Ilya Gertsbakh, \"\u2018Time-free\u2019 preventive maintenance of systems with structures described by signatures\", <em>Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry</em>, pp. n/a, 2015, ISSN 15241904.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asmb.2111"}}, {"title": "Models and estimation for systems with recurrent events and usage processes", "displayText": "Jerald F.
