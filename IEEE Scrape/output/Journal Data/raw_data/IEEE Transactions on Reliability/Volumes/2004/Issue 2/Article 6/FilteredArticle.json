Computing the residual connectedness reliability (RCR) of probabilistic networks under the fault model with both node & link faults is very useful, but is an NP-hard problem. Up to now, there has been little research done under this fault model. There are neither accurate solutions nor heuristic algorithms for computing the RCR. In our recent research, we challenged the problem, and found efficient algorithms for the upper & lower bounds on RCR. We also demonstrated that the difference between our upper & lower bounds gradually tends to zero for large networks, and are very close to zero for small networks. These results were used in our dependable distributed system project to find a near-optimal subset of nodes to host the replicas of a critical task."}, "references": [{"title": "Complexity of network reliability computations", "context": [{"text": "THE behavior of a distributed system can be modeled by a probabilistic network or a graph \\$G\\$ whose nodes and/or edges may fail [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Generally, there are three kinds of fault models in a probabilistic network [1]:\n\n\u2022Node fault model: The edges of a graph are perfectly reliable, but the nodes fail independently with probability \\$q _{0}\\$.\n\u2022Edge fault model: The nodes of a graph are perfectly reliable, but the edges fail independently with probability \\$q _{1}\\$.\n\u2022Node-and-edge fault model: Edges & nodes fail independently of each other, with node & edge failure probabilities equal to \\$q _{0}\\$ & \\$q _{1}\\$, respectively.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "For all these three fault models, it has been shown that the analysis problems are all NP-hard [1], [5]\u2013\n[7]; that is, there exists no efficient algorithms for computing \\$R(G)\\$.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Ball [1] has shown that the following point estimate reliability analysis problem is also NP-hard.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/net.3230100206", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "M.
