Using an example of external shocks affecting an item, it is shown that, though formally the influence is not smooth in this case, the corresponding exponential formula still holds. On the other hand, internal covariates do not necessarily lead to the not-absolutely-continuous conditional Cdf. If the internal covariate process specifies the full information on the item's failure process, then the corresponding conditional Cdf is not absolutely continuous. If the observed internal covariate does not provide complete information on the item's state, then the corresponding conditional Cdf can be still absolutely continuous, and the exponential formula holds."}, "references": [{"title": "The Statistical Analyses of Failure Time Data", "context": [{"text": " The topic was addressed in [1], and then treated on a technical level using the martingale approach in [2], [3].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " As this property can depend on the item's environment, it brings into consideration an issue of external & internal covariates [1] to be addressed in the Section II.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "J.
