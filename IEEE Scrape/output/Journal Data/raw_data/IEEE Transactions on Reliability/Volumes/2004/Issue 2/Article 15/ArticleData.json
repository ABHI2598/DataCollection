Using this model, the operational reliability of a switch with a specific contact assembly can be assessed for given vibration conditions. Under the vibration conditions, a minimum contact spring force is necessary for proper functioning of the switch, while the magnitude of contact uncertainty determines the need of an additional force to ensure operational reliability. With reduced contact uncertainty, the operational reliability of switches approaches either 0 or 1, solely depending upon the design & operational conditions. In this model, the parameters of c', b, & /spl sigma///spl mu/ need to be determined either empirically or experimentally before the model can be used for reliability assessment. To theoretically determine those parameters, Hertz contact with randomly distributed surface asperities needs to be considered. Finally, although this model starts from a log-normal distribution of electrical contact, the approach can be applied to other distributions, such as the inverse Gaussian and Weibull distributions.",
