When both types of repair are possible, an important problem is to determine the repair policy; that is, the type of repair which should be carried out after a failure. In this paper, an optimal allocation problem is studied for a monotonic failure rate repairable system under some resource constraints. In the first model, the numbers of minimal & perfect repairs are fixed, and the optimal repair policy maximizing the expected system lifetime is studied. In the second model, the total amount of repair resource is fixed, and the costs of each minimal & perfect repair are assumed to be known. The optimal allocation algorithm is derived in this case. Two numerical examples are shown to illustrate the procedures."}, "references": [{"title": "Improvement, deterioration and optimal replacement under age-replacement with minimal repair", "context": [{"text": " Furthermore, because the Brown & Proschan model was introduced in [3], many authors have discussed the optimal maintenance policies based on that model (for example in [1], [10], and [17]), dealt with availability [5] & statistical inference on the parameters in the model [9], [12], or considered the warranty problem under this model [7].", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "Improvement and deterioration for a repairable system are studied, in particular in terms of the effect of ageing on the distribution of the time to first failure under a nonhomogeneous Poisson process.
