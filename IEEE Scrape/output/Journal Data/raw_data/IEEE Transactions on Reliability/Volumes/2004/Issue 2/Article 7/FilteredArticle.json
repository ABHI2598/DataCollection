We first define in mathematics the maximum extent of resource sharing for a protection path given the corresponding working path according to the current network link-state. Then the problem of solving the least-cost working & protection path-pair (in terms of the sum of the cost) is formulated into an Integer Linear Programming process. Due to the dependency of the protection path on its working path, however, the formulation is not scalable with the network size, and takes an extra effort to solve. Therefore, we introduce two heuristic algorithms, called Iterative Two-Step-Approach (ITSA) & Maximum Likelihood Relaxation (MLR), which aim to explore the approximating optimal solutions with less computation time. We evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes, and make a comparison with some reported counterparts. The simulation results show that the ITSA scheme, with a properly defined tolerance to optimality, can achieve the best performance at the expense of more computation time. On the other hand, MLR delivers a compromise between computation efficiency & performance."}, "references": [{"title": "Survivable Networks: Algorithms for Diverse Routing", "context": [{"text": " Experts have conducted research since the mid 1990's to equip the Internet & metro-area networks with reliability & resilience to protect against any unexpected interruption [1], [2], [4]\u2013[15], [17].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " With NS, Suurballe's algorithm [1] is adopted to find the least-cost working & protection path-pair in the network, where resource sharing is not allowed.", "sec": "sec4", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "R.
