When both types of repair are possible, an important problem is to determine the repair policy; that is, the type of repair which should be carried out after a failure. In this paper, an optimal allocation problem is studied for a monotonic failure rate repairable system under some resource constraints. In the first model, the numbers of minimal & perfect repairs are fixed, and the optimal repair policy maximizing the expected system lifetime is studied. In the second model, the total amount of repair resource is fixed, and the costs of each minimal & perfect repair are assumed to be known. The optimal allocation algorithm is derived in this case. Two numerical examples are shown to illustrate the procedures.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1308663", "xplore-issue": "29043", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29043", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Optimal+allocation+of+minimal+%26amp%3B+perfect+repairs+under+resource+constraints&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2004&author=+Lirong+Cui&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.829143&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=193&endPage=199&volumeNum=53&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "38", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Resource management", "Cost function", "Probability density function", "Hazards", "Technology management", "Mechanical engineering", "Systems engineering and theory", "Shape", "Weibull distribution", "System performance"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["failure analysis", "reliability", "maintenance engineering", "optimisation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["repair sequence", "optimal allocation", "perfect repair", "resource constraint", "complex system", "minimal repair", "functioning state", "repair policy", "monotonic failure rate", "expected system lifetime", "repair cost", "optimization algorithm"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Optimal allocation of minimal &amp; perfect repairs under resource constraints", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "8027393"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29043/1308663", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Optimal allocation of minimal &amp; perfect repairs under resource constraints", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "TRANSIENT ANALYSIS OF A MULTI-COMPONENT SYSTEM MODELED BY A GENERAL MARKOV PROCESS", "displayText": "RAFAEL P\u00c9REZ-OC\u00d3N, DELIA MONTORO-CAZORLA, JUAN ELOY RUIZ-CASTRO, \"TRANSIENT ANALYSIS OF A MULTI-COMPONENT SYSTEM MODELED BY A GENERAL MARKOV PROCESS\", <em>Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research</em>, vol. 23, pp. 311, 2006, ISSN 0217-5959.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0217595906000954"}}, {"title": "Research on Location-Routing Problem  with Empirical Analysis for Regional  Logistics Distribution", "displayText": "Qian Zhang, \"Research on Location-Routing Problem  with Empirical Analysis for Regional  Logistics Distribution\", <em>Applied Mathematics</em>, vol. 05, pp. 2305, 2014, ISSN 2152-7385.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/am.2014.515224"}}, {"title": "Life cycle utility-informed maintenance planning based on lifetime functions: optimum balancing of cost, failure consequences and performance benefit", "displayText": "Samantha Sabatino, Dan M.
