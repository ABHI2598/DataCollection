This distribution has been examined in detail with respect to two measures of failure rate. Characterization results have also been studied to establish a direct link between the discrete Rayleigh distribution, and its continuous counterpart. This discretization approach not only expands the scope of reliability modeling, but also provides a method for approximating probability integrals arising out of a continuous setting. As an example, the reliability value of a complex system has been approximated. This discrete approximation in a nonnormal setting can be of practical use & importance, as it can replace the much relied upon simulation method. While the replication required is minimal, the degree of accuracy remains reasonable for our suggested method when compared with the simulation method."}, "references": [{"title": "Statistical tolerancing using a modification of Taguchi's method", "context": [{"text": " Recently, [1], [2] & [13] have embarked upon different approximation procedures for the determination of system reliability, via discretization of the \\$s\\$-normal probability law.", "sec": "sec1a", "part": "1"}, {"text": " For statistical tolerancing, or the evaluation of the reliability of a complex system under a known model, discrete approximation plays an important role [1], [2], [14].", "sec": "sec4a", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00401706.1988.10488434", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "J.
