Expressions for the Fisher information matrix elements are provided. Test-plan objectives, such as minimum variance of quantile or parameter estimator, can be written in terms of these expressions. Under Type I censoring, all experimental conditions can be described by a standardized slope parameter & a standardized log(censoring time). This article provides equivalence theorems, which can be used to check the optimality of test plans which often have two levels. The best three-level standard test plans are not optimal, but, in general, involve fewer extrapolations to low stresses than the optimal plans. Test plans for a titanium-alloy fatigue test are presented to illustrate the methods."}, "references": [{"title": "Discussion of &#822estimating fatigue curves with the random fatigue-limit model&#822", "context": [{"text": " In [1], the author remarked that the jet propulsion industry had recently generated fatigue data which suggested the existence of fatigue limits.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1271343", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "C.
