Computing the residual connectedness reliability (RCR) of probabilistic networks under the fault model with both node & link faults is very useful, but is an NP-hard problem. Up to now, there has been little research done under this fault model. There are neither accurate solutions nor heuristic algorithms for computing the RCR. In our recent research, we challenged the problem, and found efficient algorithms for the upper & lower bounds on RCR. We also demonstrated that the difference between our upper & lower bounds gradually tends to zero for large networks, and are very close to zero for small networks. These results were used in our dependable distributed system project to find a near-optimal subset of nodes to host the replicas of a critical task.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1308665", "xplore-issue": "29043", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29043", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Bounds+on+the+reliability+of+distributed+systems+with+unreliable+nodes+%26amp%3B+links&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2004&author=+Yinong+Chen&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.829152&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=205&endPage=215&volumeNum=53&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "4", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Telecommunication network reliability", "Computer network reliability", "Upper bound", "Computer networks", "Heuristic algorithms", "Computer science", "Distributed computing", "NP-hard problem", "Floors"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["graph theory", "computer network reliability", "failure analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["computer network", "unreliable nodes", "unreliable link", "distributed system", "probabilistic network", "residual connectedness reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Bounds on the reliability of distributed systems with unreliable nodes &amp; links", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "8061272"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29043/1308665", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Bounds on the reliability of distributed systems with unreliable nodes &amp; links", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "On algorithms for enumerating BC-subtrees of unicyclic and edge-disjoint bicyclic graphs", "displayText": "Yu Yang, Hongbo Liu, Hua Wang, Shigang Feng, \"On algorithms for enumerating BC-subtrees of unicyclic and edge-disjoint bicyclic graphs\", <em>Discrete Applied Mathematics</em>, pp. , 2015, ISSN 0166218X.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2015.09.025"}}, {"title": "Reliability Based Scheduling Model (RSM) for Computational Grids", "displayText": "Zahid Raza, Deo P.
