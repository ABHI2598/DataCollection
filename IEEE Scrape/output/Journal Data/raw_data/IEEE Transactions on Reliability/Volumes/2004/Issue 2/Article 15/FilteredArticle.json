Using this model, the operational reliability of a switch with a specific contact assembly can be assessed for given vibration conditions. Under the vibration conditions, a minimum contact spring force is necessary for proper functioning of the switch, while the magnitude of contact uncertainty determines the need of an additional force to ensure operational reliability. With reduced contact uncertainty, the operational reliability of switches approaches either 0 or 1, solely depending upon the design & operational conditions. In this model, the parameters of c', b, & /spl sigma///spl mu/ need to be determined either empirically or experimentally before the model can be used for reliability assessment. To theoretically determine those parameters, Hertz contact with randomly distributed surface asperities needs to be considered. Finally, although this model starts from a log-normal distribution of electrical contact, the approach can be applied to other distributions, such as the inverse Gaussian and Weibull distributions."}, "references": [{"title": "Vibration test procedure for electrical connectors and sockets", "context": [{"text": " For example, EIA-364-28D requires that separable contact & interconnection devices have contact discontinuity of duration below 1 microsecond [1].", "sec": "sec1b", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "<em>Vibration test procedure for electrical connectors and sockets</em>, June 1999.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Generic requirements for separable electrical connectors used in telecommunications hardware", "context": [{"text": "Studies have indicated that corrosion, stress relaxation, & wear are failure & degradation mechanisms of electrical connectors & interconnection devices [2]\u2013[5].", "sec": "sec1b", "part": "1"}], "order": "2", "id": "ref2", "text": "<em>Generic requirements for separable electrical connectors used in telecommunications hardware</em>, September 1992.", "refType": "biblio"}, {"title": "Connector stability test for small system connectors", "context": [{"text": "Studies have indicated that corrosion, stress relaxation, & wear are failure & degradation mechanisms of electrical connectors & interconnection devices [2]\u2013[3][5].", "sec": "sec1b", "part": "1"}], "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "Extensive studies on large sample sizes of commercial gold-plated connector systems showed that interface motion is a key element in any test methodology used to evaluate connector stability.
