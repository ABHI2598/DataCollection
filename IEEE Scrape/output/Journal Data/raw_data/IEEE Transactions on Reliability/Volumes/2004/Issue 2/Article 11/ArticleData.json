This distribution has been examined in detail with respect to two measures of failure rate. Characterization results have also been studied to establish a direct link between the discrete Rayleigh distribution, and its continuous counterpart. This discretization approach not only expands the scope of reliability modeling, but also provides a method for approximating probability integrals arising out of a continuous setting. As an example, the reliability value of a complex system has been approximated. This discrete approximation in a nonnormal setting can be of practical use & importance, as it can replace the much relied upon simulation method. While the replication required is minimal, the degree of accuracy remains reasonable for our suggested method when compared with the simulation method.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "false", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1308670", "xplore-issue": "29043", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29043", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Discrete+Rayleigh+distribution&isbn=&publicationDate=June+2004&author=D.+Roy&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.829161&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=255&endPage=260&volumeNum=53&issueNum=2", "citationCount": "27", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["US Department of Transportation", "Random variables", "Hazards", "Life estimation", "Failure analysis", "Reliability", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Time measurement", "Weibull distribution", "Solid modeling"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["statistical distributions", "reliability theory", "discrete systems", "failure analysis"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["discretization approach", "discrete rayleigh distribution", "life distribution", "reliability approximation", "failure rate"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "2", "chronOrPublicationDate": "June 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Discrete Rayleigh distribution", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "8061274"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29043/1308670", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Discrete Rayleigh distribution", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Uniform-Geometric distribution", "displayText": "Yunus Akdo\u011fan, Co\u015fkun Ku\u015f, Akbar Asgharzadeh, \u0130smail K\u0131nac\u0131, Fatemeh Sharafi, \"Uniform-Geometric distribution\", <em>Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation</em>, pp. 1, 2015, ISSN 0094-9655.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00949655.2015.1081907"}}, {"title": "Generating discrete analogues of continuous probability distributions-A survey of methods and constructions", "displayText": "Subrata Chakraborty, \"Generating discrete analogues of continuous probability distributions-A survey of methods and constructions\", <em>Journal of Statistical Distributions and Applications</em>, vol. 2, pp. , 2015, ISSN 2195-5832.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40488-015-0028-6"}}, {"title": "Discrete Gamma Distributions: Properties and Parameter Estimations", "displayText": "Subrata Chakraborty, Dhrubajyoti Chakravarty, \"Discrete Gamma Distributions: Properties and Parameter Estimations\", <em>Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods</em>, vol. 41, pp. 3301, 2012, ISSN 0361-0926.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03610926.2011.563014"}}, {"title": "Exponentiated Geometric Distribution: Another Generalization of Geometric Distribution", "displayText": "Subrata Chakraborty, Rameshwar D.
