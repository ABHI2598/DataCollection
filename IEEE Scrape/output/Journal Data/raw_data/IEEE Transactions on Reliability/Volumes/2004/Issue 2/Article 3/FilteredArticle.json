These times are alternated in the evolution of the system, and they form 2 separate geometric processes. The stationary study of this system when the repair times form a renewal process has been made . This paper also considers that operational times are partitioned into two well-distinguished classes successively occupied: good, and preventive. An algorithmic approach is performed to determine the transition probabilities for the Markov process which governs the system, and other performance measures beyond those in are calculated in a well-structured form. The results are applied to a numerical example, and the transient quantities are compared with the ones obtained in the stationary case. The computational implementation of the mathematical expressions formulated are performed using the Matlab program."}, "references": [{"title": "The rate of occurrence of failures", "context": [{"text": " A study of the geometric processes and applications is in [1].", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " The mathematical expression for a Markov process has been formulated in [1].", "sec": "sec3d", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3215190", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "Y.
