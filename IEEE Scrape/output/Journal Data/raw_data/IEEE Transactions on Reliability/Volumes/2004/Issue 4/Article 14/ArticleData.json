This paper presents optimal cost-effective design policies for k-out-of-n:G subsystems subjected to imperfect fault-coverage. It is assumed that there exists a k-out-of-n:G subsystem in a nonseries-parallel system and, except for this subsystem, the redundancy configurations of all other subsystems are fixed. This paper also presents optimal design polices which maximize overall system reliability. As a special case, results are presented for k-out-of-n:G systems subjected to imperfect fault-coverage. Examples then demonstrate how to apply the main results of this paper to find the optimal configurations of all subsystems simultaneously. In this paper, we show that the optimal n which maximizes system reliability is always less than or equal to the n which maximizes the reliability of the subsystem itself. Similarly, if the failure cost is the same, then the optimal n which minimizes the average system cost is always less than or equal to the n which minimizes the average cost of the subsystem. It is also shown that if the subsystem being analyzed is in series with the rest of the system, then the optimal n which maximizes subsystem reliability can also maximize the system reliability. The computational procedure of the proposed algorithms is illustrated through the examples.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1360115", "xplore-issue": "29832", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29832", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=Optimal+design+of+k-out-of-n%3AG+subsystems+subjected+to+imperfect+fault-coverage&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2004&author=S.V.+Amari&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.837703&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=567&endPage=575&volumeNum=53&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "31", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Cost function", "Failure analysis", "Reliability", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Independent component analysis", "Application software", "Redundancy", "Design optimization", "Industrial engineering", "Fault diagnosis"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["cost reduction", "consecutive system reliability", "failure analysis", "fault diagnosis", "optimisation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["average system cost minimisation", "optimal design", "k-out-of-n:G subsystem", "imperfect fault-coverage system", "component failure", "cost-effective design policy", "nonseries-parallel system", "overall system reliability", "optimal configuration"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["system reliability", "Cost-effective design", "imperfect fault-coverage", "optimization"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Optimal design of k-out-of-n:G subsystems subjected to imperfect fault-coverage", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "8202848"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29832/1360115", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Optimal design of k-out-of-n:G subsystems subjected to imperfect fault-coverage", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Multi-state systems with multi-fault coverage", "displayText": "Gregory Levitin, Suprasad V.
