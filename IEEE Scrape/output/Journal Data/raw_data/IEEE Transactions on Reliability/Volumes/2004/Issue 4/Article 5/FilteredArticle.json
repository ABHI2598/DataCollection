The capacity of a network is the maximum amount of flow which can be transmitted through the network. Although there are existing algorithms for network capacity computation, it would create a great number of repetitions to compute the capacity of each subnetwork anew upon generation in the process. This is true because subnetworks are generated by combining certain links to the current one, and hence each current subnetwork is embedded in those new subnetworks. Recently, a number of methods have been proposed in the context of searching a method which efficiently computes the capacity of subnetworks by utilizing the given information of minimal paths, and preferably without many repetitions in sequential computations. But, most of the methods still have drawbacks of either failing to give correct results in certain situations, or computing the capacity of each subnetwork anew whenever the subnetwork is generated. In this paper, we propose a method based on the concepts of signed minimal path, and unilateral link, as defined in the text. Our method not only computes the capacity of each subnetwork correctly, but also eliminates the repetitive steps in sequential computations, and thereby efficiently reduces the number of subnetworks to consider for capacity computation as well. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the method. The drawbacks of other methods are also discussed with counter examples."}, "references": [{"title": "A fast algorithm for the performance index of a telecommunication network", "context": [{"text": " See [1], [2], and [8]\u2013[13] for references.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Reference [1] points out that the method [2] lacks generality, and modifies it by utilizing a vector, each element of which is the remaing capacity of the corresponding link.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " But the method [1] may produce different results on different order of mp being applied, and hence fails in general to give correct results.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Reference [12] discusses the drawbacks of the methods in [1] and [13] with some counter examples, but does not provide any procedure of capacity determination explicitly.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Reference [11] also presents the counter examples to show that the methods in [1] and [13] fail, and correctly computes the capacity of each subnetwork.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Recently, [7] proposes a method based on maximal-residual-capacity to complement the methods in [1] and [13], but also yields incorrect results in certain situations, as shown by a counter example given in Section IV-B.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": " \n \nIn the process of evaluating network performance, subnetworks are often generated as unions of mp [1], [2], [9] [10]\u2013[13].", "sec": "sec3b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " References [1], [13] essentially compute the capacity of \\$L_{I}\\$ as follows.", "sec": "sec4b", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "A performance index for a telecommunication network is defined as a composite index integrating the important measures of both reliability and capacity.
