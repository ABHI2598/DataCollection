Detecting intrusions is an important part of assuring the quality/reliability of computer systems by quickly detecting intrusions and associated quality/reliability problems in order to take corrective actions. In this paper, we present and compare two methods of forecasting normal activities in computer systems for intrusion detection. One forecasting method uses the average of long-term normal activities as the forecast. Another forecasting method uses the EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average) one-step-ahead forecast. We use a Markov chain model to learn and predict normal activities used in the EWMA forecasting method. A forecast of normal activities is used to detect a large deviation of the observed activities from the forecast as a possible intrusion into computer systems. A Chi square distance metric is used to measure the deviation of the observed activities from the forecast of normal activities. The two forecasting methods are tested on computer audit data of normal and intrusive activities for intrusion detection. The results indicate that the Chi square distance measure with the EWMA forecasting provides better performance in intrusion detection than that with the average-based forecasting method."}, "references": [{"title": "Intrusion Detection", "context": [{"text": " Detecting intrusions is an important part of assuring quality and reliability of computer systems by quickly detecting intrusions, and associated quality and reliability problems in order to take corrective actions [1]\u2013\n[4].", "sec": "sec1b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Existing work on intrusion detection uses mainly two types of data: computer audit/log data, and network traffic data [1] [2] [3].", "sec": "sec3a", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "R.

The method uses cascaded k-Means clustering and the ID3 decision tree learning methods to characterize a training data set having data points with known characterization. The k-Means clustering method first partitions the training instances into k clusters using Euclidean distance similarity. On each training cluster, representing a density region of normal or anomaly instances, the invention builds an ID3 decision tree. The decision tree on each cluster refines the decision boundaries by learning the sub-groups within the cluster. A test data point is then subjected to the clustering and decision trees constructed form the training instances. To obtain a final decision on classification, the decisions of the k-Means and ID3 methods are combined using rules: (1) the Nearest-neighbor rule, and (2) the Nearest-consensus rule. </p>", "title": "METHOD TO INDENTIFY ANOMALOUS DATA USING CASCADED K MEANS CLUSTERING AND AN ID3 DECISION TREE", "patentNumber": "7792770", "filingDate": "25 February 2008", "assignees": ["LOUISIANA TECH RESEARCH FOUNDATION A DIVISION OF LOUISIANA TECH UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION INC"], "ipcClasses": ["G06N0050000"], "grantDate": "07 September 2010", "inventors": "Phoha, Vir V.; Balagani, Kiran S.", "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7792770.PN.&OS=PN/7792770", "pocClasses": ["706045000"], "pocClassList": "706045000", "order": "1"}], "lastupdate": "2016-08-04T15:00:27", "isEarlyAccess": false, "publisher": "IEEE", "title": "EWMA forecast of normal system activity for computer intrusion detection", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "13", "publicationNumber": "24", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "EWMA forecast of normal system activity for computer intrusion detection", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29832/1360114", "mlTime": "PT0.215076S", "ieeeCitationCount": "17"}}
