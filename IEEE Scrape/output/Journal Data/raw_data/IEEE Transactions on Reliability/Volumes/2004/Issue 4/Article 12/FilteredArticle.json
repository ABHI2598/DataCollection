It is based on observation of the correlations between the variables measured in the course of server activity. Some of the stronger of these correlations undergo drastic weakening at the onset of faults. A methodology is presented for choice of the variables to be observed, and of the monitoring parameters. To be noted are the robustness of the method, and the low cost of installation and maintenance of the system. Recommendations are given on real-world implementation of the method, as a basis for an automated protection system."}, "references": [{"title": "Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Engineering Systems", "context": [{"text": "OVER THE years, many techniques have emerged for server downtime minimization [1], [2], including limit checking, spectral analysis, analytical redundancy, and parity relations.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Reference [1] gives us an overview of methods and systems in common use for detecting and analyzing faults.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "id": "ref1", "text": "J.
