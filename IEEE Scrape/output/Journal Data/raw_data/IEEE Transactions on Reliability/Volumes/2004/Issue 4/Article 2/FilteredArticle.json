Assume that the system after repair cannot be \"as good as new\", and the deterioration of the system is stochastic. Under these assumptions, we use a replacement policy N based on the failure number of the system. Then our aim is to determine an optimal replacement policy N/sup */ such that the average cost rate (i.e., the long-run average cost per unit time) is minimized. An explicit expression of the average cost rate is derived. Then, an optimal replacement policy is determined analytically or numerically. Furthermore, we can find that a repair model for the three-state repairable system in this paper forms a general monotone process model. Finally, we put forward a numerical example, and carry through some discussions and sensitivity analysis of the model in this paper."}, "references": [{"title": "Optimum preventive maintenance policy", "context": [{"text": " Barlow and Hunter [1] first presented a minimal repair model in which repair does not renew the age of the system.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.8.1.90", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "R.
