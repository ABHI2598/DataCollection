This paper describes the modeling methodology and the solution procedure implemented in DEEM, a dependability modeling and evaluation tool specifically tailored for Multiple Phased Systems.

DEEM relies upon Deterministic and Stochastic Petri Nets as the modeling formalism, and on Markov Regenerative Processes for the model solution. When compared to existing general-purpose tools based on similar formalisms, DEEM offers advantages on both the modeling side (sub-models neatly model the phase-dependent behaviors of MPS), and on the evaluation side (a specialized algorithm allows a considerable reduction of the solution cost and time).
