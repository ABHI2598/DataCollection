Detecting intrusions is an important part of assuring the quality/reliability of computer systems by quickly detecting intrusions and associated quality/reliability problems in order to take corrective actions. In this paper, we present and compare two methods of forecasting normal activities in computer systems for intrusion detection. One forecasting method uses the average of long-term normal activities as the forecast. Another forecasting method uses the EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average) one-step-ahead forecast. We use a Markov chain model to learn and predict normal activities used in the EWMA forecasting method. A forecast of normal activities is used to detect a large deviation of the observed activities from the forecast as a possible intrusion into computer systems. A Chi square distance metric is used to measure the deviation of the observed activities from the forecast of normal activities. The two forecasting methods are tested on computer audit data of normal and intrusive activities for intrusion detection. The results indicate that the Chi square distance measure with the EWMA forecasting provides better performance in intrusion detection than that with the average-based forecasting method.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1360114", "xplore-issue": "29832", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29832", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=EWMA+forecast+of+normal+system+activity+for+computer+intrusion+detection&isbn=&publicationDate=Dec.+2004&author=+Nong+Ye&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.837705&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=557&endPage=566&volumeNum=53&issueNum=4", "citationCount": "30", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Intrusion detection", "Pattern recognition", "Testing", "Training data", "Pattern matching", "Predictive models", "Computer security", "Computer errors", "White noise", "Industrial engineering"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["moving average processes", "security of data", "computer network reliability", "Markov processes"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["computer security", "EWMA forecast", "exponentially weighted moving average", "normal system activity", "computer intrusion detection", "computer system quality", "computer system reliability", "Markov chain model", "Chi square distance metric", "computer audit data"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["intrusion detection", "Computer audit data", "computer security", "EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average) forecast"], "type": "Author Keywords "}], "issue": "4", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Dec. 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "EWMA forecast of normal system activity for computer intrusion detection", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "8202847"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29832/1360114", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "1", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "patentCitations": [{"grantDate": "07 September 2010", "inventors": "Phoha, Vir V.; Balagani, Kiran S.", "patentNumber": "7792770", "ipcClassList": "G06N0050000", "pdfLink": "http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US7792770.pdf", "title": "METHOD TO INDENTIFY ANOMALOUS DATA USING CASCADED K MEANS CLUSTERING AND AN ID3 DECISION TREE", "order": "1", "pocClassList": "706045000", "pocClasses": ["706045000"], "filingDate": "25 February 2008", "id": "07792770", "patentAbstract": "The invention is a computer implemented technique for id entifying anomalous data in a data set. The method uses cascaded k-Means clustering and the ID3 decision tree learning methods to characterize a training data set having data points with known characterization. The k-Means clustering method first partitions the training instances into k clusters using Euclidean distance similarity. On each training cluster, representing a density region of normal or anomaly instances, the invention builds an ID3 decision tree. The decision tree on each cluster refines the decision boundaries by learning the sub-groups within the cluster. A test data point is then subjected to the clustering and decision trees constructed form the training instances. To obtain a final decision on classification, the decisions of the k-Means and ID3 methods are combined using rules: (1) the Nearest-neighbor rule, and (2) the Nearest-consensus rule. </p>", "patentLink": "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7792770.PN.&OS=PN/7792770", "assignees": ["LOUISIANA TECH RESEARCH FOUNDATION A DIVISION OF LOUISIANA TECH UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION INC"], "ipcClasses": ["G06N0050000"], "appNum": "12072252"}], "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "EWMA forecast of normal system activity for computer intrusion detection", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Adaptive wear-leveling algorithm for PRAM main memory with a DRAM buffer", "displayText": "Sung Kyu Park, Min Kyu Maeng, Ki-Woong Park, Kyu Ho Park, \"Adaptive wear-leveling algorithm for PRAM main memory with a DRAM buffer\", <em>ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems</em>, vol. 13, pp. 1, 2014, ISSN 15399087.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "acmLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2558427"}}, {"title": "A Novel Network Traffic Anomaly Detection Model Based on Superstatistics Theory", "displayText": "Yue Yang, Hanping Hu, Wei Xiong, Fan Ding, \"A Novel Network Traffic Anomaly Detection Model Based on Superstatistics Theory\", <em>Journal of Networks</em>, vol. 6, pp. , 2011, ISSN 1796-2056.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4304/jnw.6.2.311-318"}}, {"title": "A Dynamic Intrusion Detection System Based on Multivariate Hotelling\u2019s T2 Statistics Approach for Network Environments", "displayText": "Aneetha Avalappampatty Sivasamy, Bose Sundan, \"A Dynamic Intrusion Detection System Based on Multivariate Hotelling\u2019s T2 Statistics Approach for Network Environments\", <em>The Scientific World Journal</em>, vol. 2015, pp. 1, 2015, ISSN 2356-6140.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/850153"}}, {"title": "Defending DDoS attacks in software defined networking based on improved Shiryaev\u2013Roberts detection algorithm", "displayText": "Wang Xiulei, Chen Ming, Wei Xianglin, Zhang Guomin, \"Defending DDoS attacks in software defined networking based on improved Shiryaev\u2013Roberts detection algorithm\", <em>Journal of High Speed Networks</em>, vol. 21, pp. 285, 2015, ISSN 18758940.", "order": "4", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JHS-150526"}}, {"title": "A parallel genetic local search algorithm for intrusion detection in computer networks", "displayText": "Mohammad Saniee Abadeh, Jafar Habibi, Zeynab Barzegar, Muna Sergi, \"A parallel genetic local search algorithm for intrusion detection in computer networks\", <em>Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</em>, vol. 20, pp. 1058, 2007, ISSN 09521976.", "order": "5", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2007.02.007"}}, {"title": "Tracking the complexity of interactions between risk incidents and engineering systems", "displayText": "James H.

The proposed methodology is applied to TCP and disposed in two steps. First, a quantization of the TCP header space is accomplished, so that a unique symbol is associated with each TCP segment. TCP-based network traffic is thus captured, quantized and represented by a sequence of symbols. The second step in our approach is the modeling of these sequences by means of a Markov chain.
