We employ a parallel test schedule. Neighboring processors test each other, and report the results. Our diagnostic objective is to find a fault-free processor or set of processors. The system may then be sequentially diagnosed by repairing those processors tested faulty according to the identified fault-free set, or a job may be run on the identified fault-free processors. We establish an upper bound on the maximum number of faults which can be sustained without invalidating the test results under worst case conditions. We give test schedules and diagnostic algorithms which meet the upper bound as far as the highest order term. We compare these near optimal diagnostic algorithms to alternative algorithms, both new and already in the literature, and against an upper bound ideal case algorithm, which is not necessarily practically realizable. For eight-way array systems with N processors, an ideal algorithm has diagnosability 3N/sup 2/3/-2N/sup 1/2/ plus lower-order terms. No algorithm exists which can exceed this. We give an algorithm which starts with tests on diagonally connected processors, and which achieves approximately this diagnosability. So the given algorithm is optimal to within the two most significant terms of the maximum diagnosability. Similarly, for four-way array systems with N processors, no algorithm can have diagnosability exceeding 3N/sup 2/3//2/sup 1/3/-2N/sup 1/2/ plus lower-order terms. And we give an algorithm which begins with tests arranged in a zigzag pattern, one consisting of pairing nodes for tests in two different directions in two consecutive test stages; this algorithm achieves diagnosability (3/2)(5/2)/sup 1/3/N/sup 2/3/-(5/4)N/sup 1/2/ plus lower-order terms, which is about 0.85 of the upper bound due to an ideal algorithm."}, "references": [{"title": "Diagnosis of processor arrays", "context": [{"text": " However, to maintain consistency with [1], we will seek to identify at least one fault-free processor.", "sec": "sec2b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Reference [1] proposed an algorithm to reach this goal, but the algorithm was only applied to the case in Fig. 1(b), the 8-way array.", "sec": "sec2b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Moreover, [1] does the diagnosis based on the cluster level instead of the single processor level.", "sec": "sec2b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Using clusters in [1] also causes many fault-free processors to be wrongly marked as suspect, and included in the perimeter which separates the apparent Fault-Free Sets of processors.", "sec": "sec2b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The algorithm in [1] divides the processors into 3 \u00d7 3 blocks.", "sec": "sec6a1b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "For the algorithm in [1], we count 3 \u00d7 3 blocks.", "sec": "sec6b1b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Also, we know that our proposed algorithm's diagnosability is much better than [1], by about a factor of 2.1, and reaches that of the ideal to the first 2 significant terms.", "sec": "sec6b2", "part": "1"}, {"text": "Fig. 17 plots the diagnosability for an 8-way array system with various test schedules, including [1].", "sec": "sec6b2", "part": "1"}, {"text": "4-way array systems are not treated in [1].", "sec": "sec6b3b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "After these tests, we view the array as composed of a number of 2 \u00d7 2 blocks cf. the 3 \u00d7 3 blocks in [1].", "sec": "sec6b3b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Compare this to the monolithic 3 \u00d7 3 blocks in [1].", "sec": "sec6b3b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " In the test procedure, each (2 \u00d7 2) block of [1] functions as a single processor in an ideal algorithm, so a diamond is also the optimal geometric form for the modified [1] in 4-way array systems.", "sec": "sec6b3b", "part": "1"}, {"text": "We note that the result on the 4-way array system for our modified method of [1] is even superior to the same method on an 8-way array system.", "sec": "sec6b3b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " Fig. 20 gives the diagnosability for an ideal algorithm, our adaptation of the algorithm in [1], and our proposed algorithms.", "sec": "sec6b4", "part": "1"}, {"text": "When the system size is large, the diagnosability of our proposed algorithm is much better than [1] by a factor of about 2.1 for 8-way arrays.", "sec": "sec7", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "abstract": "This paper introduces an approach to diagnosis of processor arrays, assuming that processors are horizontally, vertically and diagonally connected to their neighbors.
