The RAP is a well known NP-hard problem which has been the subject of much prior work, generally in a restricted form where each subsystem must consist of identical components in parallel to make computations tractable. Meta-heuristic methods overcome this limitation, and offer a practical way to solve large instances of the relaxed RAP where different components can be placed in parallel. The ant colony method has not yet been used in reliability design, yet it is a method that is expressly designed for combinatorial problems with a neighborhood structure, as in the case of the RAP. An ant colony optimization algorithm for the RAP is devised & tested on a well-known suite of problems from the literature. It is shown that the ant colony method performs with little variability over problem instance or random number seed. It is competitive with the best-known heuristics for redundancy allocation.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1331686", "xplore-issue": "29412", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29412", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=An+ant+colony+optimization+algorithm+for+the+redundancy+allocation+problem+%28RAP%29&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2004&author=+Yun-Chia+Liang&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.832816&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=417&endPage=423&volumeNum=53&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "170", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Ant colony optimization", "Redundancy", "Reliability", "Cost function", "Genetic algorithms", "Associate members", "Optimization methods", "NP-hard problem", "Concurrent computing", "Testing"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["combinatorial mathematics", "genetic algorithms", "reliability theory", "redundancy", "consecutive system reliability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["series-parallel system", "ant colony optimization algorithm", "redundancy allocation problem", "NP-hard problem", "meta-heuristic methods", "reliability design", "combinatorial optimization", "genetic algorithm"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An ant colony optimization algorithm for the redundancy allocation problem (RAP)", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "8113195"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29412/1331686", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An ant colony optimization algorithm for the redundancy allocation problem (RAP)", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Cold vs. hot standby mission operation cost minimization for 1-out-of-N systems", "displayText": "Gregory Levitin, Liudong Xing, Yuanshun Dai, \"Cold vs. hot standby mission operation cost minimization for 1-out-of-N systems\", <em>European Journal of Operational Research</em>, vol. 234, pp. 155, 2014, ISSN 03772217.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2013.10.051"}}, {"title": "Minimum Cost Multicast Routing Using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm", "displayText": "Xiao-Min Hu, Jun Zhang, \"Minimum Cost Multicast Routing Using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm\", <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em>, vol. 2013, pp. 1, 2013, ISSN 1024-123X.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/432686"}}, {"title": "An efficient particle swarm approach for mixed-integer programming in reliability\u2013redundancy optimization applications", "displayText": "Leandro dos Santos Coelho, \"An efficient particle swarm approach for mixed-integer programming in reliability\u2013redundancy optimization applications\", <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety</em>, vol. 94, pp. 830, 2009, ISSN 09518320.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2008.09.001"}}, {"title": "Machine Tool Reliability", "displayText": "pp. 277, 2016, ISBN 9781119038962.", "order": "4", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781119038962.refs"}}, {"title": "A comprehensive review on solar PV maximum power point tracking techniques", "displayText": "J.
