These goodness-of-fit tests range from graphical techniques, to tests which exploit characterization results for the specified underlying model. In this article, we propose a goodness-of-fit test for the location-scale family based on progressively Type-II censored data. The test statistic is based on sample spacings, and generalizes a test procedure proposed by Tiku . The null distribution of the test statistic is shown to be approximated closely by a s-normal distribution. However, in certain situations it would be better to use simulated critical values instead of the s-normal approximation. We examine the performance of this test for the s-normal and extreme-value (Gumbel) models against different alternatives through Monte Carlo simulations. We also discuss two methods of power approximation based on s-normality, and compare the results with those obtained by simulation. Results of the simulation study for a wide range of sample sizes, censoring schemes, and different alternatives reveal that the proposed test has good power properties in detecting departures from the s-normal and Gumbel distributions. Finally, we illustrate the method proposed here using real data from a life-testing experiment. It is important to mention here that this test can be extended to multi-sample situations in a manner similar to that of Balakrishnan et al."}, "references": [{"title": "Goodness of fit statistics based on the spacings of complete or censored samples", "context": [{"text": " The statistic \\$T\\$ was suggested by Tiku [1] for complete, and doubly Type-II censored samples.", "sec": "sec3", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-842X.1980.tb01175.x", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "M.
