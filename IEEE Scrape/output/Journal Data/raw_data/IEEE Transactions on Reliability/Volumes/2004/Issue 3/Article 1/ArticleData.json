The algorithm is based on the canonical normal form of the Boolean function, but overcomes the large number of terms needed, by using an intrinsic order criterion (IOC) to select the elementary states to evaluate. This intrinsic order implies lexicographic (truth table) order. The criterion guarantees a priori that the probability of a given elementary system state is always greater than or equal to the probability of another state, for any set of basic probabilities. IOC is exclusively based on the positions of 0 & 1 in the binary n-tuples defining the elementary states. The algorithm does not require any qualitative analysis of the fault tree. The computational cost mainly depends on the basic event probabilities, and is related to system complexity, only because the Boolean function must be evaluated.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "true", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1331671", "xplore-issue": "29412", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29412", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=An+intrinsic+order+criterion+to+evaluate+large%2C+complex+fault+trees&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2004&author=L.+Gonzalez&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.833307&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=297&endPage=305&volumeNum=53&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "4", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Fault trees", "Boolean functions", "Performance analysis", "Data structures", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Binary decision diagrams", "Upper bound", "Computational efficiency", "Mathematics", "Fault diagnosis"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["probabilistic logic", "computational complexity", "fault trees", "Boolean functions", "logic design"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["probability bounds", "coherent fault trees", "system unavailability", "prespecified maximum error", "canonical normal form", "Boolean function", "intrinsic order criterion", "lexicographic order", "truth table", "elementary system state", "qualitative analysis", "computational cost", "system complexity"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An intrinsic order criterion to evaluate large, complex fault trees", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "8113181"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29412/1331671", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "An intrinsic order criterion to evaluate large, complex fault trees", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "ALGORITHM COMPARING BINARY STRING PROBABILITIES IN COMPLEX STOCHASTIC BOOLEAN SYSTEMS USING INTRINSIC ORDER GRAPH", "displayText": "LUIS GONZ\u00c1LEZ, \"ALGORITHM COMPARING BINARY STRING PROBABILITIES IN COMPLEX STOCHASTIC BOOLEAN SYSTEMS USING INTRINSIC ORDER GRAPH\", <em>Advances in Complex Systems (ACS)</em>, vol. 10, pp. 111, 2007, ISSN 0219-5259.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219525907001136"}}, {"title": "Fuzzy fault tree analysis based on Ta??S model with application to INS/GPS navigation system", "displayText": "Hua Song, Hong-Yue Zhang, C.
