However, testing of these systems is difficult. Due to incomplete control of their runtime and communication environment, precise temporal properties of multimedia systems are nonreproducible. Traditional software testing, which mainly deals with functional correctness, cannot be directly applied to testing temporal properties. Furthermore, time points are hard to be measured exactly, and in this sense are nondeterministic and nonreproducible. To address this problem, we propose a framework for testing the generic temporal properties of media objects in distributed multimedia software systems (DMSS). The timing properties are based on Allen's basic binary temporal relations between two objects, which can be extended to cover multiple objects. We have developed techniques for test case generation, and test result analysis based on a distributed tester architecture. Test templates are used in test case generation to reduce the possibility of human error, and the entire testing procedure can be automated. A prototype system has been built to test a DEC HPAS multimedia presentation system, which is a multimedia system supporting W3C's SMIL standard. Detailed discussions on practical issues illustrated with a number of actual tests are given. Experimental results have shown that our framework is effective in detecting errors in temporal properties. Furthermore, ways to reduce the test effort have been discussed, and guidelines for coming up with criteria for verdict computation based on the real-time requirements of the applications have been suggested."}, "references": [{"title": "Maintaining knowledge about temporal intervals", "context": [{"text": " The temporal properties of a multimedia presentation can be expressed by a basic set of temporal relations of media objects formulated by Allen in 1983 [1], as shown in Fig. 3 & Fig. 4.", "sec": "sec1", "part": "1"}, {"text": "The objective of our framework is to test the binary temporal relations proposed in [1] between multimedia object pairs.", "sec": "sec3b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " These four faulty systems simulate faults which fall into the set of binary temporal relations proposed by Allen [1].", "sec": "sec5a", "part": "1"}, {"text": " This is because a temporal relation which governs the start event \\$A_{S}\\$ of the first object \\$A\\$, and the end event \\$B_{E}\\$ of the second object \\$B\\$, is missing from the temporal relations defined by [1].", "sec": "sec5b", "part": "1"}, {"text": " However, the temporal properties of most distributed multimedia authoring & presentation applications can be expressed in terms of binary relations between pairs of media objects with simple controls or synchronizations, and it is sufficient to represent these properties using the set of relations proposed by Allen [1].", "sec": "sec5d", "part": "1"}, {"text": " This technique avoids having to test different scenarios exhaustively, because all common scenarios can be constructed using a combination of the basic temporal relations as defined by Allen [1].", "sec": "sec5d", "part": "1"}, {"text": "From our experience, it is adequate to use simple time-line based specifications as proposed by Allen [1] for basic timing tests in multimedia presentations.", "sec": "sec5d", "part": "1"}], "order": "1", "links": {"acmLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/182.358434", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "J.
