These applications include N-Modular Redundant hardware systems and diversely designed software systems based on N-Version Programming. The most sophisticated & complex algorithms can even tolerate malicious (or Byzantine) subsystem errors. The algorithms can be implemented in hardware or software depending on the characteristics of the application, and the type of voter selected. Many voting algorithms have been defined in the literature, each with particular strengths and weaknesses. Having surveyed more than 70 references from the literature, a functional classification is used in this paper to provide taxonomy of those voting algorithms used in safety-critical applications. We classify voters into three categories: generic, hybrid, and purpose-built voters. Selected algorithms of each category are described, for illustrative purposes, and application areas proposed. Approaches to the comparison of algorithm behavior are also surveyed. These approaches compare the acceptability of voter behavior based on either statistical considerations (e.g., number of successes, number of benign or catastrophic results), or probabilistic computations (e.g., probability of choosing correct value in each voting cycle or average mean square error) during q voting cycles.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1331674", "xplore-issue": "29412", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29412", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=A+taxonomy+for+software+voting+algorithms+used+in+safety-critical+systems&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2004&author=G.+Latif-Shabgahi&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.832819&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=319&endPage=328&volumeNum=53&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "58", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Taxonomy", "Software safety", "Voting", "Software algorithms", "Application software", "Hardware", "Software design", "Software systems", "Probability", "Mean square error methods"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["consecutive system reliability", "safety-critical software", "probability", "redundancy", "fault tolerant computing", "computational complexity"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["triple modular redundancy", "software voting algorithms taxonomy", "error masking capability", "N-modular redundant hardware system", "N-version programming", "complex algorithm", "subsystem error", "functional classification", "generic voters", "hybrid voters", "purpose-built voter", "statistical consideration", "probabilistic computation", "voting cycle", "average mean square error", "result amalgamation", "result selection", "safety-critical system"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A taxonomy for software voting algorithms used in safety-critical systems", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "8113183"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29412/1331674", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A taxonomy for software voting algorithms used in safety-critical systems", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Improving super-resolution mapping through combining multiple super-resolution land-cover maps", "displayText": "Xiaodong Li, Feng Ling, Giles M.
