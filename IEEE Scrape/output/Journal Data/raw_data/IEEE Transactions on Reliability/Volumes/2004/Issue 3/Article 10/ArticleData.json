System reliability optimization algorithms generally assume that component reliability values are known exactly, i.e., they are deterministic. In practice, that is rarely the case. For risk-averse system design, the estimation uncertainty, propagated from the component estimates, may result in unacceptable estimation uncertainty at the system-level. The system design problem is thus formulated with multiple objectives: (1) to maximize the system reliability estimate, and (2) to minimize its associated variance. This formulation of the reliability optimization is new, and the resulting solutions offer a unique perspective on system design. Once formulated in this manner, standard multiple objective concepts, including Pareto optimality, were used to determine solutions. Pareto optimality is an attractive alternative for this type of problem. It provides decision-makers the flexibility to choose the best-compromise solution. Pareto optimal solutions were found by solving a series of weighted objective problems with incrementally varied weights. Several sample systems are solved to demonstrate the approach presented in this paper. The first example is a hypothetical series-parallel system, and the second example is the fault tolerant distributed system architecture for a voice recognition system. The results indicate that significantly different designs are obtained when the formulation incorporates estimation uncertainty. If decision-makers are risk averse, and wish to consider estimation uncertainty, previously available methodologies are likely to be inadequate.", "subType": "IEEE IEEE Transaction", "sections": {"multimedia": "false", "abstract": "true", "footnotes": "false", "disclaimer": "false", "keywords": "true", "citedby": "true", "references": "true", "figures": "true", "authors": "true"}, "copyrightOwner": "IEEE", "isStandard": false, "articleId": "1331680", "xplore-issue": "29412", "publisher": "IEEE", "issueLink": "/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29412", "isACM": false, "allowComments": false, "isStaticHtml": false, "rightsLink": "http://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ieee&publication=0018-9529&title=System+optimization+with+component+reliability+estimation+uncertainty%3A+a+multi-criteria+approach&isbn=&publicationDate=Sept.+2004&author=D.W.+Coit&ContentID=10.1109/TR.2004.833312&orderBeanReset=true&startPage=369&endPage=380&volumeNum=53&issueNum=3", "citationCount": "52", "keywords": [{"kwd": ["Uncertainty", "Reliability", "Software performance", "Redundancy", "Random variables", "Design optimization", "Fault tolerant systems", "Speech recognition", "Fault diagnosis", "Cost function"], "type": "IEEE Keywords"}, {"kwd": ["redundancy", "Pareto optimisation", "fault tolerance", "estimation theory", "risk analysis", "decision making", "speech recognition"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["redundancy allocation", "system optimization", "component reliability", "estimation uncertainty", "multicriteria approach", "random variables", "optimization algorithms", "risk-averse system design", "reliability estimation", "variance", "standard multiple objective concepts", "Pareto optimality", "decision-makers", "hypothetical series-parallel system", "fault tolerant", "distributed system architecture", "voice recognition system"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "issue": "3", "chronOrPublicationDate": "Sept. 2004", "isFreeDocument": false, "userInfo": {"subscribedContent": false, "fileCabinetUser": false, "showGet802Link": false, "member": false, "individual": false, "showPatentCitations": true, "showOpenUrlLink": false, "institute": false, "guest": false, "fileCabinetContent": false}, "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "System optimization with component reliability estimation uncertainty: a multi-criteria approach", "publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "isConference": false, "isDynamicHtml": false, "volume": "53", "accessionNumber": "8113189"}, "citations": {"mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/24/29412/1331680", "publisher": "IEEE", "patentCitationCount": "0", "publicationNumber": "24", "contentType": "periodicals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "System optimization with component reliability estimation uncertainty: a multi-criteria approach", "isEarlyAccess": false, "paperCitations": {"nonIeee": [{"title": "Integrated framework to optimize RAM and cost decisions in a process plant", "displayText": "Rajiv Kumar Sharma, Pooja Sharma, \"Integrated framework to optimize RAM and cost decisions in a process plant\", <em>Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries</em>, vol. 25, pp. 883, 2012, ISSN 09504230.", "order": "1", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jlp.2012.04.013"}}, {"title": "Bi-objective redundancy allocation problem for a system with mixed repairable and non-repairable components", "displayText": "Hossein Zoulfaghari, Ali Zeinal Hamadani, Mostafa Abouei Ardakan, \"Bi-objective redundancy allocation problem for a system with mixed repairable and non-repairable components\", <em>ISA Transactions</em>, vol. 53, pp. 17, 2014, ISSN 00190578.", "order": "2", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isatra.2013.08.002"}}, {"title": "Model based Binary Decision Diagrams for Complex Networks Reliability Optimization", "displayText": "Mohamed-Larbi Rebaiaia, Daoud Ait-Kadi, \"Model based Binary Decision Diagrams for Complex Networks Reliability Optimization\", <em>IFAC Proceedings Volumes</em>, vol. 43, pp. 114, 2010, ISSN 14746670.", "order": "3", "links": {"openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "crossRefLink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3182/20101006-2-PL-4019.00023"}}, {"title": "Fault-tolerant embedded system design and optimization considering reliability estimation uncertainty", "displayText": "Naruemon Wattanapongskorn, David W.
