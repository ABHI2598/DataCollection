Unfortunately, political, economic, time, and other constraints imposed by the real world, inhibit the ability of researchers to calculate reliability efficiently and accurately. Because of such constraints, reliability must undergo an evolutionary change. The first step in this evolution is to re-interpret the concept so that it m...", "documentLink": "/document/1179817", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1179817", "pdfSize": "223KB"}, "id": "ref1", "text": "T.
