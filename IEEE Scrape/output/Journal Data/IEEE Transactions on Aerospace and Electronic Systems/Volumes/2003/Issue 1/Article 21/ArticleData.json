The navigation system requires sensors to detect changes in altitude and driving direction which are installed in modern cars for different purposes (e.g. ABS sensors). The layout of the navigation system is discussed and simulations are carried out over driving distances of approximately 150 km on the basis of realistic road data and ordinary sensor accuracies. Positioning errors of lower than 10 m (standard deviation) are observed. To achieve this accuracy the synchronization error between measured and mapped data must be continually estimated. The introduced navigation method is ideal to complete present commercial car navigation systems using Navstar GPS.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Jan. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667513", "date": "Jan. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "1", "pages": "2 - 12", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["W.
