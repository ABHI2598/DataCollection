Our formulation methodology permits to solve the problem on a PC, within ten min, by off-the-shelf integer linear programming software. This method decides which containers to load (and in which compartment) and which to leave on the ground.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "140", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "150", "date_publication": "Jan. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667522", "date": "Jan. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "1", "pages": "140 - 150", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
