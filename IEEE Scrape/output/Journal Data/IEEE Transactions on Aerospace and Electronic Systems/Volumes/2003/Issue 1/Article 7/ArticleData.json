I. Basic theory and application of the Compensation Theorem", "abstract": "The analysis of synchronous commutations in switching converters is discussed. A reduced resistive circuit for the analysis of synchronous commutations is introduced by applying the Compensation Theorem. Based on a matrix model, a new method for the analysis of both hard and soft synchronous commutations is formulated, which permits a straightforward understanding operation of switching converters. The method of analysis is presented herein in its basic version, for the analysis of nonisolated hard-switching converters, while the general formulation and its applications to the analysis and synthesis of DC-DC regulators is presented in the companion paper Part II.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "282", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "297", "date_publication": "Jan. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667533", "date": "Jan. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "1", "pages": "282 - 297", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["N.
