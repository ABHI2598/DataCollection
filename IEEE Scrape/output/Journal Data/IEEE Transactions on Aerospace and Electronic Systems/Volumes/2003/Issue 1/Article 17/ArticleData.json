To resolve the point target/tree trunk ambiguity problem, a detailed study was conducted to evaluate the use of new detection features based on the complex frequency correlation function (FCF). This paper presents an analytical examination of FCF and its physical meaning, the results of a numerical simulation study conducted to evaluate the performance of a detection algorithm that uses FCF, and the corroboration of theory with experimental observations conducted at 35 and 95 GHz. The FCF-based detection algorithm was found to correctly identify tree trunks as such in over 90% of the cases, while exhibiting a false alarm rate of only 3%.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "125", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "139", "date_publication": "Jan. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667521", "date": "Jan. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "1", "pages": "125 - 139", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
