This controller does not need the knowledge of modal variables and spacecraft angular velocity. The absence of measurements of these variables is compensated by appropriate dynamics of the controller, which supplies their estimates. The Lyapunov technique is applied in the design of this dynamic controller. Possible source of instability of the controlled system in real cases are the influence of the flexibility on the rigid motion, the presence of disturbances acting on the structure, and parameter variations. In order to attenuate their effects and to damp out undesirable vibrations affecting the spacecraft attitude, distributed piezoelectric actuators are used. In fact, in presence of disturbances and/or parameter variation the proposed controller ensures an approximate solution of the control problem.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "747", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "759", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782814", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "747 - 759", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
