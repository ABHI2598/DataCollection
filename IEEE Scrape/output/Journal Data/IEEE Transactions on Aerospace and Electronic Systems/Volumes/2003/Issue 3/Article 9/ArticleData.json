The results include the effect of front-end bandwidth and early-late gate spacing. We also investigate a blind method for cancelling the multipath, in order to improve the time-of-arrival estimate. Our approach uses early-late gate processing on an objective function derived from an adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filter that attempts to match the crosscorrelation of the received signal with a multipath-free replica of the desired crosscorrelation. This method performs reasonably well, and decreases the multipath-induced pseudorange error by approximately a factor of 2, even in very stressing multipath environments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "911", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "920", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782826", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "911 - 920", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
