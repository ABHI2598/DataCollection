Since the electromagnetic wave propagation velocity in the soil depends on many factors, velocity uncertainty is inevitable. However, we have observed that, unlike conventional airborne/spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, the PSI GPSAR system is very robust against the velocity uncertainty under mild conditions. Theoretical analysis is provided to explain this observation. Although our discussion is based on the PSI GPSAR system, it applies to other GPR-based (ground-penetrating radar) landmine detection systems as well.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "849", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "861", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782822", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "849 - 861", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Renbiao Wu", "Kunlong Gu", "Jian Li", "M.
