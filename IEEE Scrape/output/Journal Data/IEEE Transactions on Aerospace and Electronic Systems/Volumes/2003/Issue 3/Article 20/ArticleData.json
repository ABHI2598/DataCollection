However, the parameter estimates of the METDE are biased in the presence of noise. The METDE algorithm is improved for unbiased parameter estimation via minimizing a modified cost function. Convergence behaviors and variances of the system variables of the amended method are derived. Computer simulations are included to corroborate the theoretical analysis and to evaluate the adaptive multipath delay estimation performance of the proposed algorithm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "777", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "785", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782816", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "777 - 785", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["H.
