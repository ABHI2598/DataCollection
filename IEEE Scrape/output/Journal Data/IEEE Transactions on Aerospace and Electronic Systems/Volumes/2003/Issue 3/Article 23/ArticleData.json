First, a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) optimal midcourse guidance law is designed to minimize the control effort and the distance between the missile and the target. Then, converting the acceleration command from guidance law into attitude command, a quaternion-based sliding-mode attitude controller is proposed to track the attitude command and to cope with the effects from variations of missile's inertia, aerodynamic force, and wind gusts. The exponential stability of the overall system is thoroughly analyzed via Lyapunov stability theory. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed guidance law and the associated TVC.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "824", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "837", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782820", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "824 - 837", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Fu-Kuang Yeh", "Hsiuan-Hau Chien", "Li-Chen Fu"], "keywords": ["Lyapunov methods", "aerodynamics", "asymptotic stability", "attitude control", "missile guidance", "variable structure systems", "Lyapunov stability theory", "TVC", "acceleration command", "aerodynamic force", "attitude command", "autopilot system", "exponential stability", "guidance system", "inertia", "missiles", "optimal midcourse guidance", "quaternion-based sliding-mode controller", "sliding-mode control", "theater ballistic missile", "thrust vector control", "wind gusts", "Acceleration", "Aerodynamics", "Attitude control", "Control systems", "Force control", "Missiles", "Nonlinear control systems", "Optimal control", "Sliding mode control", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "1238739"}
