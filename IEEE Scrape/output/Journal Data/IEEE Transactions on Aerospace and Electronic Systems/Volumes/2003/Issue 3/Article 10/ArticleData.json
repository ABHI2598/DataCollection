By exploiting cyclostationarity, the signal direction of arrival (DOA) estimation can be significantly improved. We propose two new direction finding beamformer algorithms that exploit cyclostationarity. These algorithms show very attractive estimation performance over conventional beamforming methods, as depicted by simulation results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1051", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1056", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782834", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "1051 - 1056", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
