In order to avoid detection by the GMTI sensor, the targets use a \"move-stop-move\" strategy, where a target deliberately stops or moves at a very low speed for some time before accelerating again. In this case, when the target's radial velocity (along the line of sight from the sensor) falls below a certain minimum detectable velocity, the target is not detected by the sensor. Under these conditions, the use of an estimator, which does not take care of this move-stop-move motion explicitly, will result in broken tracks. The tracker proposed here handles the evasive move-stop-move motion via the VS-IMM estimator, where the tracker mode set is augmented with a \"stopped-target\" model when the estimated speed of the target falls below a certain threshold. Using this additional stopped-target model, the target track is kept \"alive\" even in the absence of a measurement. A simulated scenario is used to illustrate the selection of design parameters and the operation of the tracker. Performance measures are presented to contrast the benefits of the VS-IMM estimator, which uses the stopped-target model, over a standard IMM estimator.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1098", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1103", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782841", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "1098 - 1103", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["T.
