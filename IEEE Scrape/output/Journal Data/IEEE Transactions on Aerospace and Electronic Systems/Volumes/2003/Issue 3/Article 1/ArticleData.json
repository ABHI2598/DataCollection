We discuss the basic concepts of CCSK and describe a system based on the use of random or pseudorandom codes for biphase modulation. We use simulation to show that the bit error rate (BER) for CCSK can be closely estimated by using existing equations that apply to M-ary orthogonal signaling (MOS). Also, we show that significantly fewer computations are required for CCSK than for MOS when the number of bits per symbol is the same. We show that using biphase modulation results in waveforms that have a large time-bandwidth product and very low input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thus inherently have an LPI by a radiometer. We evaluate detection by a radiometer and show that LPI can be achieved by using codes of lengths greater than about 2/sup 12/ (i.e., by transmitting more than about 12 bits per symbol). Results illustrate the effect that the CCSK symbol length and error probability, and the radiometer integration time and probability of false alarm (PFA), have on detection by a radiometer. We describe a variation of CCSK called truncated CCSK (TCCSK). In this system, the code of length 2/sup k/ is cyclically shifted, then truncated and transmitted. Although shortened, the truncated code still represents k bits of information, thus leading to an increased data rate. We evaluate radiometer detection of TCCSK and it is shown that the probability of detection is increased compared with the detection of CCSK.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "786", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "798", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782817", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "786 - 798", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
