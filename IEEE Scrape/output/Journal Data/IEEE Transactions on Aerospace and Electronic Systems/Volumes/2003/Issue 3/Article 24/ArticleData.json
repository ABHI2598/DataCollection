Our approach incorporates a powerful algorithmic framework, which we have used to develop dynamic route and sensor planning algorithms for multivehicle team coordination. Furthermore, this framework allows the development of a class of algorithms to match the extent of communication and coordination permissible for the particular mission. We have implemented a prototype of this framework and presented results for the case when full coordination between the teammates is allowed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "799", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "812", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782818", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "799 - 812", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
