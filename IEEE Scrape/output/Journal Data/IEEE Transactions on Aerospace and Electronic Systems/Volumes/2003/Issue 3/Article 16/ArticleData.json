Compared with sample matrix inversion (SMI) methods, it is shown to significantly reduce the deleterious effects of impulsive noise spikes (outliers) on convergence performance of metrics; such as (normalized) output residue power and signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). For the case of no outliers, the MCC convergence performance remains commensurate with SMI methods for several practical interference scenarios. It is shown that the MCC offers natural protection against desired signal (target) cancellation when weight training data contains strong target components. In addition, results are shown for a high-fidelity, simulated, barrage jamming and nonhomogenous clutter environment. Here the MCC is used in a space-time adaptive processing (STAP) configuration for airborne radar interference mitigation. Results indicate the MCC produces a marked SINR performance improvement over SMI methods.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "883", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "900", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782824", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "883 - 900", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
