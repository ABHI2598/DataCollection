The method is based on model-following and command input management techniques. The degradation in dynamic performance is accounted for through a degraded reference model. A novel method for,selecting such a model is also presented. The degradation in steady-state performance is dealt with using a command input adjustment technique. When a fault is detected by the fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) scheme, the reconfigurable controller is designed automatically using an eigenstructure assignment algorithm in an explicit model-following framework so that the dynamics of the closed-loop system follow that of the degraded reference model. In the mean time, the command input is also adjusted automatically to prevent the actuators from saturation. The proposed method has been evaluated using the lateral dynamics of an F-8 aircraft against actuator faults subject to constraints on the magnitude of actuator inputs. Very encouraging results have been obtained.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "838", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "848", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782821", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "838 - 848", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Youmin Zhang", "Jin Jiang"], "keywords": ["actuators", "aircraft control", "closed loop systems", "eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "fault tolerance", "military aircraft", "F-8 aircraft", "actuator faults", "closed-loop system", "command input adjustment technique", "command input management techniques", "degraded reference model", "eigenstructure assignment algorithm", "explicit model-following framework", "fault detection", "fault tolerant control system design", "lateral dynamics", "model-following techniques", "partial actuator fault", "performance degradation", "reconfigurable controller", "steady-state performance", "Actuators", "Automatic control", "Control systems", "Degradation", "Fault detection", "Fault diagnosis", "Fault tolerant systems", "Process design", "Steady-state", "System performance", ""], "arnumber": "1238740"}
