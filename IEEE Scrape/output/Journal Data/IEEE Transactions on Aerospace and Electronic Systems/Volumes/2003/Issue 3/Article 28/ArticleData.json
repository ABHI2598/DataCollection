If multiple platforms are available in the configuration, the redundancy provided by the multiplicity of platforms can speed up the time to integer ambiguity fixing while at the same time improve the reliability of the solution. An approach to effectively construct ambiguity constraints through the multiplicity of platforms is presented herein. The use of these ambiguity constraints to position multiple moving platforms with respect to each other is then discussed. A series of simulations and field tests are designed and conducted to investigate the effects of different system parameters on this approach, with a configuration of up to 10 moving platforms. The test results show that the use of ambiguity constraints can improve the time to integer ambiguity fixing by up to 67%, relative to the case when no constraints are used. In addition, the use of ambiguity constraints is found to enhance the ability of the multiple platform system to detect wrong ambiguity fixes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "936", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "948", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782828", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "936 - 948", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["N.
