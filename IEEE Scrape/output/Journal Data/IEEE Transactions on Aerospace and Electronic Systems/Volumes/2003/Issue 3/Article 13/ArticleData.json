Furthermore, assuming transmitting and receiving antennas operating on separated platforms, key design issues relevant to formation flying must be solved. Mathematical models are presented for computation of attitude and pointing angles. Main design constraint is the capability of maintaining swath overlap, but selected strategy also depends on the cost of spacecraft attitude maneuvering or antenna beam electronic steering. The model has been applied considering a large transmitting/receiving primary mission and a receiving-only small satellite. In this case antenna steering was preferred. Finally, if the passive antenna is smaller than the active one, overlap maintenance is simplified, obviating the need for yaw rotations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "949", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "960", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782829", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "949 - 960", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
