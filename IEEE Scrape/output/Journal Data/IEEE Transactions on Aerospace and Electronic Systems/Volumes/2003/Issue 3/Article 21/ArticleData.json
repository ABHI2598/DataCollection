The boost PFCs with three active soft-switching cells, which are boost, forward and flyback, and a passive soft-switching cell are first discussed. The operating principle and performance characteristics of the PFCs are then presented in detail, from which the boost with a flyback soft-switching cell and that with a passive soft-switching cell are designed and implemented. Performance comparison among these PFCs is also presented. Hardware measurements are used to verify the theoretical discussion. The presented information can provide designers a good application reference.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "961", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "975", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782830", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "961 - 975", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Tsai-Fu Wu", "Chien-Chih Chen", "Chih-Lung Shen", "Cheng-Nan Wu"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "power factor correction", "switching convertors", "500 W", "active soft-switching cell", "boost power factor corrector", "boost soft-switching cell", "design analysis", "flyback soft-switching cell", "forward soft-switching cell", "passive soft-switching cell", "Electromagnetic interference", "HDTV", "Hardware", "Power electronics", "Reactive power", "Switches", "Switching circuits", "Switching converters", "Switching loss", "Zero voltage switching", ""], "arnumber": "1238749"}
