A ballute is deployed from the sensor projectile shortly after release from the munition. This type of system is capable of viewing munition impact and subsequent target effects over a wide variety of conditions and offers the possibility of real-time battle damage assessment (BDA). However, fundamental limits exist on the duration that the camera is able to view the target after impact for a particular required separation distance between the sensor projectile and the target at impact and the field of regard (FOR) of the camera. Munition release altitude and velocity significantly affect these fundamental limits. Optimal performance is attained under high altitude and low speed munition drop conditions. Basic characteristics of the camera projectile also significantly influence system performance. Maximum target view time is attained with a low weight high drag configuration., To reduce the maximum acceleration experienced by the sensor projectile, a small delay time between the release of the small sensor projectile from the munition and inflation of ballute is required.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "813", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "823", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782819", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "813 - 823", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
