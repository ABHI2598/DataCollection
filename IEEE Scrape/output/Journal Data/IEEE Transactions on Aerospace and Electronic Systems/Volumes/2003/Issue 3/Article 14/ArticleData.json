With an ACSS, the inverters are in parallel operation and each inverter has a voltage robust controller to achieve system stability and robustness, and a current robust controller to track the averaged inductor current of the inverters to achieve equal current distribution. In the proposed system, the current-sharing control loop is independent of the voltage control loop. Therefore, equal current distribution among the inverters, fast response, and tight regulation can be achieved. Additionally, the ACSS in each inverter can be readily implemented with two operational amplifiers. Simulation results and hardware measurements or a single-inverter system and a two-inverter system, and simulation results of a three-inverter system with linear and nonlinear loads have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed control scheme in equal current distribution and fast regulation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1002", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1015", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7789385", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "1002 - 1015", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yu-Kai Chen", "Yu-En Wu", "Tsai-Fu Wu", "Chung-Ping Ku"], "keywords": ["PWM invertors", "current distribution", "digital signal processing chips", "robust control", "ACSS", "DSP-based robust controls", "averaged current-sharing strategy", "averaged inductor current", "equal current distribution", "linear loads", "nonlinear loads", "operational amplifiers", "paralleled multi-inverter systems", "single-inverter system", "system stability", "three-inverter system", "two-inverter system", "voltage robust controller", "Control systems", "Current distribution", "Digital signal processors", "Hardware", "Inductors", "Inverters", "Operational amplifiers", "Robust control", "Robust stability", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "1238752"}
