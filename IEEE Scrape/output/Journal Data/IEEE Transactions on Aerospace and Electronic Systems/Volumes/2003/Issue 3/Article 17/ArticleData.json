These constellations form an array that is sparsely populated and irregularly spaced; therefore, traditional matched filtering is inadequate for dealing with the constellation's radiation pattern. To aid in the design, analysis, and signal processing of radar satellite constellations and sparse arrays in general, the characterization of the resolution and ambiguity functions of such systems is investigated. We project the radar's received phase history versus five sensor parameters: time, frequency, and three-dimensional position, into a phase history in terms of two eigensensors that can be interpreted as the dimensions of a two-dimensional synthetic aperture. Then, the synthetic aperture expression is used to derive resolution and the ambiguity function. Simulations are presented to verify the theory.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "921", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "935", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782827", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "921 - 935", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["N.
