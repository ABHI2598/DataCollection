Based on a mathematical model proposed by Garrard and Jordan (1977), a rich variety of bifurcation phenomena such as saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation, and cycle fold bifurcations are observed in the numerical simulations of longitudinal flight dynamics of the F-8 aircraft. The occurrence of saddle-node bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation may result in jump behavior and pitch oscillations of flight dynamics. The analysis leads to a division of the longitudinal flight space into several maneuvering regions, and may provide more understanding of the longitudinal flight dynamics.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1103", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1112", "date_publication": "July 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7782842", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "1103 - 1112", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Der-Cherng Liaw", "Cahu-Chung Song", "Yew-Wen Liang", "Wen-Ching Chung"], "keywords": ["aerospace simulation", "aircraft control", "bifurcation", "F-8 aircraft", "Hopf bifurcation", "aircraft mass", "bifurcation analysis", "cycle fold bifurcation", "elevator deflection", "longitudinal flight dynamics", "mathematical model", "numerical simulation", "saddle-node bifurcation", "Aerodynamics", "Aircraft", "Bifurcation", "Couplings", "Elevators", "Limit-cycles", "Mathematical model", "Nonlinear dynamical systems", "Nonlinear equations", "Numerical simulation", ""], "arnumber": "1238764"}
