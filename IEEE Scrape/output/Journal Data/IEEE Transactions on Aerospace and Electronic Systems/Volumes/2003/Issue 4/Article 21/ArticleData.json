Motivated by the frequently encountered problem of clutter-edge heterogeneity, we model the secondary data as a probability mixture and impose a hierarchical model for the inference problem. A two-stage CFAR detector structure is proposed. Empirical Bayesian inference is adopted in the first stage for training data selection followed by a CFAR processor using the identified homogeneous training set for target detection. One of the advantages of the proposed algorithm is its inherent adaptivity; i.e., the threshold setting is much less sensitive to the nonstationary environment compared with other standard CFAR procedures.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1462", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1470", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7925773", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "1462 - 1470", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Biao Chen", "P.
