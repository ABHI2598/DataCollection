The proposed method is applied to the command line-of-sight (CLOS) guidance law design. The SOFLC contains two sets of fuzzy inference logic. One is the fuzzy logic controller and the other is the rule modifier. The new learning method of the rule modifier is developed based on a fuzzy learning algorithm. The modification value of each rule is based on the fuzzy firing weight, so that learning of the rule bases is reasonable. Finally, two engagement scenarios are examined, and a comparison between a fuzzy logic control (FLC), an optimal learning FLC, and the proposed SOFLC CLOS guidance laws is made. Simulation results show that the proposed SOFLC guidance law can achieve better guidance performance than the other guidance laws.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1144", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1151", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7943067", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "1144 - 1151", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Chih-Min Lin", "Chun-Fei Hsu", "Yi-Jen Mon"], "keywords": ["fuzzy control", "learning systems", "missile guidance", "CLOS guidance law design", "SOFLC design method", "command line-of-sight guidance", "fuzzy firing weight", "fuzzy inference logic", "fuzzy learning algorithm", "fuzzy logic controller", "optimal learning FLC", "rule modifier", "self-organizing fuzzy logic control", "Acceleration", "Azimuth", "Design methodology", "Fuzzy logic", "Fuzzy sets", "Humans", "Inference algorithms", "Missiles", "Optimal control", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "1261118"}
