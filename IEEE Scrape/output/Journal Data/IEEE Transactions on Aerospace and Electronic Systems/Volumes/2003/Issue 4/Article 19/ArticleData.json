These tests show that proper antenna pointing on an inertially stabilized spacecraft can lead to significant access time through the relay satellite even without active antenna pointing. We summarize the test results, the simulations to model the effects of antenna pattern and space loss, and the expected contact times. We also show how antenna beam width affects the results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1263", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1269", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7925767", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "1263 - 1269", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
