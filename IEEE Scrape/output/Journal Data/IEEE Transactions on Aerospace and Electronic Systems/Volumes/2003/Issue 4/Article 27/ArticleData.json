This correspondence presents an iterative approach using the Newton-Raphson (NR) method that has good efficiency and accuracy and is free from singularity and nonconvergence except in a small region near the center of the Earth. Comparisons with other well-known approximate methods are made in complexity and performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1457", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1461", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7943079", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "1457 - 1461", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yuanxin Wu", "Ping Wang", "Xiaoping Hu"], "keywords": ["Newton-Raphson method", "geodesy", "navigation", "ECEF", "Earth-centered Earth-fixed coordinate", "GPS navigation", "NR method", "Newton-Raphson method", "geodetic coordinate", "iterative approach", "Approximation algorithms", "Earth", "Ellipsoids", "Equations", "Geodesy", "Global Positioning System", "Iterative algorithms", "Iterative methods", "Kernel", "Navigation", ""], "arnumber": "1261144"}
