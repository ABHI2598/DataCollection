This image formation technique is based on nonquadratic optimization, and the images it produces appear to exhibit enhanced features. We quantify such feature enhancement through a number of criteria. The findings of our analysis indicate that the new feature-enhanced SAR image formation method provides images with higher resolution of scatterers, and better separability of different regions as compared with conventional SAR images. We also provide an ATR-based evaluation. We run recognition experiments using conventional and feature-enhanced SAR images of military targets, with three different classifiers. The first classifier is template based. The second classifier makes a decision through a likelihood test, based on Gaussian models for reflectivities. The third classifier is based on extracted locations of the dominant target scatterers. The experimental results demonstrate that the new feature-enhanced SAR imaging method can improve the recognition performance, especially in scenarios involving reduced data quality or quantity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1375", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1395", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7943074", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "1375 - 1395", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
