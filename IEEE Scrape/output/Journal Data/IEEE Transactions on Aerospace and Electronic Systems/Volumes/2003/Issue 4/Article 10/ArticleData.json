In image-based target tracking, the mode of the target is observed as a Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP) and the aim is to compute optimal estimates of the target's state. We present a reduced complexity algorithm in two steps. First, a gauge transformation is used to reexpress the filtering equations in a form that is computationally more efficient for time discretization than naive discretization of the filtering equations. Second, a spatial aggregation algorithm with guaranteed performance bounds is presented for the time-discretized filters. A numerical example illustrating the performance of the resulting reduced-complexity filtering algorithms for a switching turn-rate model is presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1277", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1291", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7925769", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "1277 - 1291", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["V.
