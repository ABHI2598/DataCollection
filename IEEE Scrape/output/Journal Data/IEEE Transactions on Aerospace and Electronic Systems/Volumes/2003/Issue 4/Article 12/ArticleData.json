The phase ambiguities associated with the long baselines of the interferometer are resolved using the \"coarse\" angle estimates provided by the multimode antenna. This results in the elimination of the short baseline interferometers of the conventional five-element interferometer. It is shown here that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) must be above a threshold value to resolve the phase ambiguities with a high degree of probability. An expression that shows the dependence of this threshold SNR on the interferometer spacing and the variance of the angle estimates provided by the multimode antenna is derived. A single three-element wideband multimode antenna interferometer can replace several five-element conventional interferometers, each covering a separate frequency band.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1396", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1406", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7925771", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "1396 - 1406", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["K.
