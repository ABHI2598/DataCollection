The maximum likelihood (ML) and the asymptotic (large sample size) ML (AML) estimators are derived. To reduce the computational complexity of the maximization of the nonlinear two-dimensional criterion function of the AML estimator, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm based on the RELAXation method. It allows decoupling the problem of jointly estimating the parameters of the signal components into a sequence of simpler problems, where the parameters of each component are separately and iteratively estimated. The proposed method overcomes the resolution limitation of the classical monopulse technique and resolves multiple targets exhibiting an arbitrarily small difference in azimuth as long as their Doppler frequencies differ at least by the inverse of the number of integrated pulses, provided that enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per pulse is available. The performance of the proposed AML-RELAX estimator is numerically investigated through Monte Carlo simulation and Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) calculation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1316", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1332", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7887525", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "1316 - 1332", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["F.
