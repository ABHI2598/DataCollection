The details of the controller design and analysis are discussed. In addition, to extend the controllable speed range, the commutating angle of the drive system is suitably adjusted as the motor speed goes beyond base-speed. By using a 32-bit microprocessor, a fully digital drive system including a digital speed-loop controller and a digital current-loop controller is implemented here. The hardware circuit of the drive system is very simple. The system has satisfactory performance in both the pulsewidth modulated (PWM) region and the single pulse region. The adjustable speed range of the system is from 10 r/min to 3000 r/min. In addition, the proposed drive system performs well in tracking ability, load disturbance rejection capability, and robustness. Several experimental results are presented to validate the theoretic analysis.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1429", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1440", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7943076", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "1429 - 1440", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ching-Guo Chen", "Tian-Hua Liu"], "keywords": ["angular velocity control", "controllers", "machine control", "microprocessor chips", "nonlinear control systems", "reluctance motor drives", "32 bits", "32-bit microprocessor", "PWM", "SRM drive system", "commutating angle", "controllable speed range", "digital current-loop controller", "load disturbance rejection capability", "nonlinear controller design", "nonlinear speed-loop controller", "pulsewidth modulated region", "single pulse region", "switched reluctance drive system", "switched reluctance motor", "tracking ability", "Commutation", "Control systems", "Digital control", "Hardware", "Microprocessors", "Nonlinear control systems", "Pulse width modulation", "Reluctance machines", "Reluctance motors", "Space vector pulse width modulation", ""], "arnumber": "1261137"}
