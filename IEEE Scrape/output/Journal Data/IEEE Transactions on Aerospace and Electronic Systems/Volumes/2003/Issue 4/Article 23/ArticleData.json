The fourth order state equation for integrated guidance and control loop is formulated taking into consideration the target uncertainties and control loop dynamics. The state equation is further changed into the normal form by nonlinear coordinate transformation. Using the normal form of state equation, an adaptive nonlinear guidance law is proposed to compensate for the uncertainties in both target acceleration and control loop dynamics. The proposed law adopts the sliding mode control approach with adaptation for unknown bound of uncertainties. The present approach can effectively solve the existing guidance problem against target maneuver and the limited performance of control loop. We have provided the stability analyses and performed simulations comparing favorably our approach to the state of the art.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1134", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "1143", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7943066", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "1134 - 1143", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Dongkyoung Chwa", "Jin Young Choi"], "keywords": ["adaptive control", "aerospace control", "missile guidance", "nonlinear control systems", "stability", "variable structure systems", "adaptive nonlinear guidance law", "control loop dynamics", "fourth order state equation", "integrated guidance", "missile guidance", "nonlinear coordinate transformation", "sliding mode control", "target acceleration", "target maneuver", "target uncertainty", "Acceleration", "Adaptive control", "Control systems", "Degradation", "Missiles", "Navigation", "Nonlinear equations", "Programmable control", "Sliding mode control", "Uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "1261117"}
