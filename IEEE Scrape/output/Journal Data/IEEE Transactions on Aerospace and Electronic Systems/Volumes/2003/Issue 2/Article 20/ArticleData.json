The proposed estimator exploits the persymmetry property typical of Toeplitz covariance matrices and is based on secondary data, free of signal components,, and with the same covariance structure of the cell under test. We prove that, plugging the proposed covariance estimator into the normalized matched filter, leads to an adaptive detector which, irrespective of the shape of the clutter power spectral density, ensures the constant false alarm rate property with respect to both the clutter covariance matrix as well as the statistics of the texture. Finally, we show that. this adaptive receiver has an acceptable loss with respect to its nonadaptive counterpart and outperforms the previously proposed CFAR adaptive NMF (ANMF).", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "719", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "724", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667568", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "719 - 724", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["E.
