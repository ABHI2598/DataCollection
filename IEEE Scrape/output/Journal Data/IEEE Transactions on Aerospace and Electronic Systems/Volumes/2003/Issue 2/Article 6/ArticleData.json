The dimension reduction not only decreases the computational load, it also reduces the sample support required for estimating the interference statistics. This results because the clutter covariance is implicitly assumed to possess a certain (nonparametric) structure. We demonstrate how imposing a parametric structure on the clutter and jamming can lead to a further reduction in both computation and secondary sample support. Our approach, referred to as space-time autoregressive (STAR) filtering, is applied in two steps: first, a structured subspace orthogonal to that in which the clutter and interference reside is found, and second, a detector matched to this subspace is used to determine whether or not a target is present. Using a realistic simulated data set for circular array STAP, we demonstrate that this approach achieves significantly lower signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) loss with a computational load that is less than that required by other popular approaches. The STAR algorithm also yields excellent performance with very small secondary sample support, a feature that is particularly attractive for applications involving nonstationary clutter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "510", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "520", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667553", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "510 - 520", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
