The focus is mainly the overvoltage transient presented in the motor. Theoretical analysis has been achieved based on the transmission line traveling wave theory. Factors contributing to the motor transient overvoltage including typically < 2 pu (per unit) bus voltage or especially the > 2 pu case are described both in theory and by experiment. An improved simple filter structure with low power loss has been proposed. Case study for an adjustable speed ac motor drive is demonstrated by means of prototype experiment to prove its performance and effectiveness.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "499", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "509", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667552", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "499 - 509", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
