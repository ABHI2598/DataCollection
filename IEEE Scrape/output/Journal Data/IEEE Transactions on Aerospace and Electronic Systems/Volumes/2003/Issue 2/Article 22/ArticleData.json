Investigated here is a hybrid passive/active filter topology that achieves ripple reduction by injecting a compensating voltage ripple across a series filter element. Both ripple feedforward and feedback are employed. The design of sensor, amplifier, and injector circuitry for this application is explored. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and high performance of the new approach, and illustrate its potential benefits. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach is most effective in cases where it is desirable to minimize the amount of capacitance in the filter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "471", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "480", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667549", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "471 - 480", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
