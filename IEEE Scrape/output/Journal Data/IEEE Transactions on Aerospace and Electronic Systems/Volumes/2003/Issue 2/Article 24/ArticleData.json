Once the processed power exceeds the switch ratings, the inverter can reduce its output reactive power and harmonic power, while still supplying the maximum real power generated by the PV arrays. In the derivation of control laws, a limit circle is defined to confine the output power of the inverter. To determine the power that the inverter can process, the instantaneous reactive power of a 1\u03c6 3W system is defined and used to calculate reactive power, which can avoid complex detections of phase angle and magnitude of the fundamental component of a nonlinear load current. Simulation results and experimental measurements have verified the proposed algorithm and the feasibility of the inverter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "635", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "646", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667561", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "635 - 646", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Tsai-Fu Wu", "Chh-Lung Shen", "Chien-Hsuan Chang", "Jeiyang Chiu"], "keywords": ["circuit simulation", "invertors", "photovoltaic power systems", "power factor correction", "power harmonic filters", "reactive power control", "PAPF", "current harmonic filtering", "grid-connection PV power inverters", "inverter harmonic power", "inverter output reactive power", "nonlinear load current fundamental component magnitude", "output power limit circles", "partial active power filters", "phase angle", "power factor improvement", "real power", "single-phase three-wire grid-connection photovoltaic power inverters", "switch ratings", "Active filters", "Inverters", "Photovoltaic systems", "Power generation", "Power harmonic filters", "Power supplies", "Power system harmonics", "Reactive power", "Solar power generation", "Switches", ""], "arnumber": "1207271"}
