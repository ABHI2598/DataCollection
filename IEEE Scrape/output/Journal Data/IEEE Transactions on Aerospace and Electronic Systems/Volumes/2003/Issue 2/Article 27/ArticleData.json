Front-end converters in the system will be required to have a high efficiency and a low total harmonic distortion (THD) of the input current. This paper explains the design of a zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) active-clamped isolated low-harmonic SEPIC rectifier for such applications. Utilization of the transformer leakage inductance for ZVS and a single-layer transformer design contribute to a high efficiency. An accurate averaged switch model has been developed, which shows that the control-to-input-current transfer function of this converter does not exhibit resonances observed in the conventional SEPIC. As a result, for closed-loop operation using average current control, damping of the coupling capacitor is not required. Operating at a switching frequency of 200 kHz, an experimental 100 W, 28 V output rectifier achieves a THD of 3-4% and efficiency exceeding 90% over the entire line frequency range.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "462", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "470", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667548", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "462 - 470", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
