The converter is the same as the standard voltage-fed PWM full-bridge converter with a diode-bridge low-pass filter front end, but with a slight modification that results in an improvement in power factor that is sufficient to satisfy the EN61000-3-2 requirements for electrical equipment. The operation of the converter is explained and analyzed, and the results of the analysis are used to determine the converter's steady-state characteristics, which are discussed in detail. A design procedure for the selection of components is then derived and demonstrated with an example. The feasibility of the converter and its ability to satisfy EN61000-3-2 requirements on electrical equipment is shown with results obtained from an experimental prototype.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "660", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "674", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667563", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "660 - 674", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
