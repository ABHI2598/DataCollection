The ac/dc rectifier part is controlled to generate a unipolar pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveform on the ac terminal by using four power switches with voltage stress of half the dc-link voltage. The carrier-based current control scheme is employed in the inner control loop to track the line current command. To regulate the dc bus voltage, a proportional-integral (PI) control is adopted in the outer control loop. The dc/ac inverter part of the system with four power switches is employed to generate a stable and clean sinusoidal output voltage to the critical load. The instantaneous current control scheme is used to track the output voltage command. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm, the simulation and experimental results based on a laboratory prototype were implemented and discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "625", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "634", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667560", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "625 - 634", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bor-Ren Lin", "Ta-Chang Wei"], "keywords": ["AC-AC power convertors", "PWM power convertors", "electric current control", "power factor", "two-term control", "AC/DC rectifier", "DC/AC inverter", "PWM waveform", "current control algorithm", "neutral-point-clamped topology", "power factor", "power switch", "proportional-integral control", "single-phase AC/AC converter", "AC generators", "Current control", "DC generators", "Pi control", "Power generation", "Proportional control", "Pulse width modulation", "Reactive power", "Topology", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "1207270"}
