The centralized and distributed tracking configurations were studied in (H.Chen et al., Proc. of SPIE Conf. on Signal and Data Processing of Small Targets, vol. 4048, 2000) using simulated air-to-air scenarios, and in (K.C. Chang, et al, IEEE Transact. on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, vol. 33, no. 4, pp. 1271-1276, 1997) with analytical results based on \u03b1-\u03b2 filters. The current work generalizes the results in the latter to the cases with more than 2 sensors. As the number of sensors increases, the performance of the distributed tracker is shown to degrade compared with the centralized estimation even when the optimal track-to-track fusion is used. An approximate track-to-track fusion is presented and compared with the optimal track-to-track fusion with performance curves for various numbers of sensors. These performance curves can be used in designing a fusion system where certain trade-offs need to be considered. Finally, these results are compared with simulation results for a realistic air-to-air encounter scenario.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "386", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "400", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667542", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "386 - 400", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Huimin Chen", "T.
