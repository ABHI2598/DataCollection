One difficulty in their use is the so-called near-far problem, where in close proximity to the ground transmitter, the pseudolite signal can be orders of magnitude stronger than the satellite signals. This large range of signal levels prevents a conventional receiver from simultaneously detecting both types of signals. This paper describes the application of a signal processing technique, known as successive interference cancellation (SIC), to the acquisition and tracking of weak satellite signals in the presence of a nearby pseudolite and possible multipath reflections of this pseudolite signal. The SIC architecture is implemented on simulated and experimental near-far data sets. The results are compared with a conventional detector and improvements in acquisition and tracking performance are illustrated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "481", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "488", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667550", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "481 - 488", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
