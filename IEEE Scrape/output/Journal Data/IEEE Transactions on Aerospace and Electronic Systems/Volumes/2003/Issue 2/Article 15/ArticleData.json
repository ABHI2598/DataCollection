The specular reflection causes significant signal fading. The diffuse reflection causes an approximately constant bias to the in-phase component of the monopulse ratio, which is the standard extractor of the direction of arrival (DOA) in the monopulse processing. The diffuse reflection also causes higher standard deviation to the in-phase component of the monopulse ratio. We propose a maximum likelihood (ML) angle extraction technique for low elevation targets of known average signal strength having a Rayleigh fluctuation. The results show that this method reduces the error of the estimated angle compared with the conventional monopulse ratio estimator. Subsequently, the ML angle extractor is modified for the unknown average signal strength case. This modified angle extractor has only a small performance degradation compared with the known average signal strength case, but it performs much better than the monopulse ratio based estimator. An algorithm to calculate the accuracy of the estimated angle (or height) is also presented. This angle extractor reduces the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by more than 50% in the signal processing stage when used in a low flying target tracking scenario. The same algorithm can be used to track sea skimmers.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "550", "volume": "39", "lastpage": "567", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7667556", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "550 - 567", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
