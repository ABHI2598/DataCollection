The \u00c2\u00bfthreshold\u00c2\u00bf case solution (which can have any specified accuracy) dictates a signal modulation bandwidth just shy of resolving the sea height variation and/or illuminated sea area (as scaled into time delay and \u00c2\u00bfsmeared\u00c2\u00bf by pointing errors). For such a modulation a relatively complete solution is obtained. These results are used to determine practical radar altimeter designs, additionally accounting for antenna size, stability, and peak power restraints. Conditions allowing neglecting of limiting or complicating effects due to temporally varying reflectivity, sea height, and vehicle position are given and shown to be satisfied for a typical satellite.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "728", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "742", "date_publication": "Nov. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "728 - 742", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Robert O.
