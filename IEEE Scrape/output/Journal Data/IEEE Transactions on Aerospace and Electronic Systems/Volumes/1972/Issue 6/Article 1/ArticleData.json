Unique features of this sounder are the preservation of data spectra, a frequency synthesizer, and a gain-change mechanism. Preservation of the spectra provided frequency information with a resolution of a few hundred hertz by use of a fast Fourier transform while the synthesizer provided the necessary frequency stability. The gain-change mechanism provided information on the strength of the resonances. Resulting data support the electrostatic-wave echo theory of topside resonances.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "712", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "720", "date_publication": "Nov. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "712 - 720", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Thomas L.
