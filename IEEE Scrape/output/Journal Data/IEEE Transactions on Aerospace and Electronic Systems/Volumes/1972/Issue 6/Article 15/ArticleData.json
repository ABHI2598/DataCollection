Uniaxial second-order motion is studied in detail, and an example is given which indicates that a constant gain filter may be designed with performance comparable to a Kalman filter. An appendix is included which shows how the approach may be extended to higher order systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "836", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "842", "date_publication": "Nov. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "836 - 842", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kitchener Clark Wilson"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Estimation theory", "Filtering theory", "Nonlinear filters", "Optimal control", "Performance gain", "Radar theory", "Radar tracking", "State estimation", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "4103058"}
