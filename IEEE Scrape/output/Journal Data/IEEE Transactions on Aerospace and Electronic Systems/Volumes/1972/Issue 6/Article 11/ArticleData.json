Both long-term drift and short-term FM noise are considered. The case of high modulation index of the noise is permitted by the theory. Forward as well as slanted beams are examined. Curves have been calculated for each case to allow rapid estimates of the bandwidth requirements to accomodate the laser noise. This, in turn, will give the resolution limit of the radar caused by that noise. A summary of the results is given.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "791", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "799", "date_publication": "Nov. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "791 - 799", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
