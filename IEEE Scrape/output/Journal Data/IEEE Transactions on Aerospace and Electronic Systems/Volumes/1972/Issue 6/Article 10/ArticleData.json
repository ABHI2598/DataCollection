These equations are combined with models of the three platform control loops to formulate a model for the system. The system model is simplified and a digital simulation is developed for studying the motion of the stable member under conditions of dynamic vehicle angular environment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "780", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "790", "date_publication": "Nov. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "780 - 790", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["F.
