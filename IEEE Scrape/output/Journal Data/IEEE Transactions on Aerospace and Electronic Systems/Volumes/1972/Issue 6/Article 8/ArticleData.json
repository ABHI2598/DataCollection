It is demonstrated that computation of the first sensitivity function requires one nth-order model in addition to the system model. This simultaneity property is extended to arbitrary single-input, nth-order, linear, constant, discrete systems. In complete analogy with results presented for continuous systems, symmetry and simultaneity properties may be established for the computation of the /th sensitivity function begin{equation*}^{l}beta^{y} triangleq frac{partial^{l}y_{i}}{partialalpha_{Jl}partialalpha_{Jl-1}cdotspartialalpha_{J2}partialalpha_{J1}}|_{alpha=alpha_{0}} {rm for} substack{i = 1,2,ldots,n\\ J_{k} = 1,2,ldots,n\\ k = 1,2,ldots,l.}end{equation*} Extension of these results to multi-input systems is also mentioned. The usefulness of the simultaneity property is illustrated by applying the results to the design of a low-sensitivity optimal control law.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "764", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "770", "date_publication": "Nov. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "764 - 770", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Charles P.
