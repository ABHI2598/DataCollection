The program consists of three phases: the establishment of suitable controls and screens to ensure piece part hardness, a supplier data monitoring program to measure hardness related parameters in a timely fashion to obtain advanced warning of potential problems, and a hardness assurance verification testing (HAVT) program to periodically measure the radiation response of parts, circuits, subsystems, and systems on a sample basis to ensure proper functioning in simulated radiation environments. All of the data relevant to hardness assurance is stored in computer memory and routinely interrogated with programs which compare current results with the engineering baseline data and other data from preceding lots. Other computer programs enable statistical estimation of system response to the radiation environment with confidence based on the expanding data base provided by the HAVT program.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "771", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "779", "date_publication": "Nov. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "771 - 779", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
