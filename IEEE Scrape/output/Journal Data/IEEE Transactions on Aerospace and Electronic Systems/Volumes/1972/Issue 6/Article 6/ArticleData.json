The parameters of the fitted distributions vary with azimuth aspect angle, type of aircraft, and radar frequency. Detection probabilities based on the estimated statistics are calculated and compared with detection probabilities based on Rayleigh statistics. This comparison indicates that the average value of radar cross section has much more effect on probability of detection than the normalized variance of RCS, and in the usual situation tends to mask the effect of the normalized variance on probability of detection.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "757", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "761", "date_publication": "Nov. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "757 - 761", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jon David Wilson"], "keywords": ["Airborne radar", "Aircraft", "Azimuth", "Frequency", "Laboratories", "Probability", "Radar cross section", "Radar detection", "Radar measurements", "Statistical distributions", ""], "arnumber": "4103049"}
