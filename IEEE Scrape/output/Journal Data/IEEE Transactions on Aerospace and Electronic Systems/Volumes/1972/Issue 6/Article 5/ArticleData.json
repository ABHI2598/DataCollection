Both techniques are applied to the holographically recorded wave (directional lighting).2) Interferometry by double exposure with directional lighting.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "751", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "756", "date_publication": "Nov. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "751 - 756", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
