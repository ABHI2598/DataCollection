The signal is assumed to be imbedded in sinusoidal clutter at the same frequency and narrow-band Gaussian noise. The density expressions are shown to be a function of the signal-to-noise power ratio and the clutter-to-noise power ratio. The expressions have been numerically evaluated for a number of conditions, and the results under each reception hypothesis are presented graphically. Under large-sample conditions, the probability density for a multisample test statistic is shown to be Gaussian, and the probability of detection expression is written such that commonly available tabulated data can be utilized to determine the probabilities.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "77", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "81", "date_publication": "Jan. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "77 - 81", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Gaylord W.
