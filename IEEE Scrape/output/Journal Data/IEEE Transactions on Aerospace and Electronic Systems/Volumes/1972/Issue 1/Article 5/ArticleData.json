The first technique assumes no a priori environmental knowledge and the second assumes almost complete environmental knowledge. Several intermediate environmental assumptions are considered. The performance of single-pulse transmission signal processors that produce CFAR for the different environments is analyzed. Probability of target detection is evaluated for Rayleigh interference and Swerling I target. It is shown that adaptive threshold techniques implemented by logarithmic amplifiers, instead of linear amplifiers, can attain better false-alarm-rate control with only small loss in target detectability.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Jan. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "27 - 34", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ramon Nitzberg"], "keywords": ["Interference", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Object detection", "Radar detection", "Radar signal processing", "Signal processing", "Signal resolution", "Surveillance", "Testing", "Threshold voltage", ""], "arnumber": "4102901"}
