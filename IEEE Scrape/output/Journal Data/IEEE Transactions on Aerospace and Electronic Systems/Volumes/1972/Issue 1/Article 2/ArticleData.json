Conventional nonregulating converters generally require two active devices, whereas in regulating converters or switching regulators as many as 10 transistors, either integrated or discrete, is not uncommon. A regulating dc-to-dc converter which provides useful regulation and which can be constructed with either two or three transistors is described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Jan. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "9 - 12", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Peter Hartigan"], "keywords": ["Capacitors", "Circuit faults", "DC-DC power converters", "Integrated circuit reliability", "Pulse width modulation converters", "Redundancy", "Regulators", "Switching converters", "Transformer cores", "Voltage", ""], "arnumber": "4102898"}
