The processingof both the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) channels generally allows an exact representation of the signals, and no loss of sensitivity need occur. However, for reasons of economy or weight only one channel is often implemented. This correspondence shows that the sensitivity loss for this case often deviates considerably from the 3-dB rule of thumb.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "75", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "77", "date_publication": "Jan. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "75 - 77", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["F.
