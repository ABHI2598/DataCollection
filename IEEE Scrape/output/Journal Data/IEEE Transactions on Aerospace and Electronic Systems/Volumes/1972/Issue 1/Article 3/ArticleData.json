This would be the case, for example, when the radiation source is a nonlocked multimode laser or when the received radiation is scattered from a satellite. Dark current is considered. The results indicate that when possible, counting times should be adjusted to be large in comparison with the background radiation coherence time, and optical amplification before detection should be employed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Jan. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "13 - 18", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Malvin Carl Teich", "Rainfield Y.
