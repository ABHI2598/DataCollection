The relationships between the objective variable and the first five parameters are established through a regression analysis of data points collected from a computerized system model. Classical techniques applied to the regression equation isolate a local maximum. Scan pattern and acceptance logic are each studied separately since their optima are independent of the other parameters of the system. Maximum probability of target acquisition is nearly unity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Jan. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "19 - 26", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Warren H.
