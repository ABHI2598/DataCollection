This limitation may be overcome if the receiver is provided with a bank of more than two contiguous filters (each followed by an envelope detector) tospan the total IF band the instantaneous IF signal might occupy. It is shown that the probability of error per bit for such a receiver is a function of 1) the ratio F of peak frequency deviation to peak frequency drift, 2) the number M of IF filter/detectors, and 3) the signal-to-noise ratio \u00c3\u009f in the output of the filter containing the signal. It is further shown thatfor a given value of F an increase in M reduces the amount of transmitter power the communication system designer must provide to yield a given probability of error per bit.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "51", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "63", "date_publication": "Jan. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "51 - 63", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["George A.
