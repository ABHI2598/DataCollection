Using Monte-Carlo techniques, the statistics of the estimated rotation of the satellite, from a known reference, were obtained. It was found that one of the parameterizations of the rotation, namely, the vector z, is best suited for estimation, since \u00c2\u00bfz is normally distributed with zero mean and its standard deviation is independent of the two direction measurements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "81", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "84", "date_publication": "Jan. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "81 - 84", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Robert Fischl", "James P.
