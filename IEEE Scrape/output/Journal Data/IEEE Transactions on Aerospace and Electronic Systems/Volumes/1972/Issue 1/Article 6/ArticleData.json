It is shown how the analysis of this radar can be greatly simplified by representing the signals in the receiver as complex variables. This representation also makes it very easy to analyze such problems as scintillation and single-sideband crosstalk.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Jan. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "35 - 42", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["James Hanson", "Prentiss Robinson"], "keywords": ["Frequency", "Geometry", "Physics", "Radar antennas", "Radar tracking", "Receiving antennas", "Signal analysis", "Silver", "Springs", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "4102902"}
