Emphasisis placed upon radar systems with control computers having limited speed and memory, and recommendations are made for allocation strategy and targetytracking algorithms, based on uniform sampling, to be used in maximizing thetarget-handling capacity in this situation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "50", "date_publication": "Jan. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "43 - 50", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Sheldon N.
