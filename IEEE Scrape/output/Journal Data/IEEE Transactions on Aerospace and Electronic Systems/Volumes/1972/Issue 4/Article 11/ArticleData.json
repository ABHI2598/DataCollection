The problems these factors produce might be overcome if a major \u00c2\u00bfmarket success\u00c2\u00bf could be achieved with CAI systems. One potentially high-volume market, having probably a lower resistance to profound innovation than other sectors of education, is the junior college. To achieve a market success which would catalyze public and private investment to sustain the growth and dissemination of CAI requires technical solutions in the areas of hardware, software, and courseware. Courseware is a term designating the applications programs for CAI systems and associated textual, audio-visual, and other materials of instruction. Two different approaches to the production of courseware and their underlying philosophies are discussed and contrasted. The extent to which these different models of courseware design and development might lead toward the goal of mass dissemination is highlighted.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "486", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "491", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "486 - 491", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
