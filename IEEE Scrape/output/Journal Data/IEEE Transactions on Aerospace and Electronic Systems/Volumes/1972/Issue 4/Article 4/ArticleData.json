By doing so, the detailed operational and economic factors are evaluated. In the past, the above-mentioned information was available after the purchase of the aircraft, and the selection of the airplane was done by little-known parameters. This program will furnish the data before the aircraft is purchased, thus taking the guessing from the selection. The high investment makes it mandatory for airline management to examine and to know ahead what to expect from the airplane and what is the acceptable return on this investment. On the other hand, an existing fleet with a given route structure can be analyzed by varying the schedule.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "419", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "427", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "419 - 427", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["George Radnoti"], "keywords": ["Aircraft", "Airplanes", "Airports", "Analytical models", "Computational modeling", "Computer networks", "Computer simulation", "Environmental economics", "Fuel economy", "Investments", ""], "arnumber": "4102980"}
