The difficulty in answering these questions is simply that no single view by any one of these groups alone provides enough perspective to do the questions justice. Consequently, this paper reflects an attempt to integrate views expressed by many people regarding the following five questions. First, \u00c2\u00bfWhat is the background, motivation, and mandates for each of the major participants affecting the development of remote sensing markets?\u00c2\u00bf Second, \u00c2\u00bfWhat can remote sensing techniques do today?\u00c2\u00bf or, \u00c2\u00bfWhat is operationally ready and what is really research?\u00c2\u00bf Third, \u00c2\u00bfWhat will be the most important operational contributions of ERTS-A?\u00c2\u00bf Fourth, \u00c2\u00bfWhat remote sensing subtleties are particularly important to understand?\u00c2\u00bf And finally, \u00c2\u00bfHow much value is there in remote sensing, for whom and when?\u00c2\u00bf", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "402", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "406", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "402 - 406", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
