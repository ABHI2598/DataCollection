This paper extends this work so as to remove the symmetrical restriction from the problem. In addition, for a staggered pulse system, optimum times of transmission are determined. In the earlier paper a global solution to the restricted optimization problem was achieved. In this paper only a locally optimum solution is achieved for the more general problem.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "517", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "527", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "517 - 527", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["O.
