The light water reactor is the dominant type of commercial nuclear reactor being installed during the 1970's. Advancement to more efficient designs, such as the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, is expected around 1980. Prospects for the breeder reactor and fusion energy systems dictate a major research and development effort. Attempts to control effluents from fossil-fired plants have resulted in a sharp increase in the use of low sulfur fuels. Research and development efforts are being intensified in an attempt to obtain a breakthrough in methods of stack emission control.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "498", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "504", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "498 - 504", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
