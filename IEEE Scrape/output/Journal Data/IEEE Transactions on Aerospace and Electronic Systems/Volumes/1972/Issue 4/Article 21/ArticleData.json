This method eliminates the need for the fifth accumulator, normally used for (Equation), as well as the need for processing this accumulated value in calculating the elevation velocity and position of the first data point.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "549", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "549", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "549", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jeffery W.
