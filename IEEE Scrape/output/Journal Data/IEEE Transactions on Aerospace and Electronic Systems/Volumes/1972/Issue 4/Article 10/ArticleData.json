Brief discussions are presented in the areas of system design, coordinated operation, more effective operation, and political- public relations problems. Recent results in the fifth basic need for system security, the development of more sophisticated approaches to the problems of system control, are presented. The results are in research areas sponsored by Electric Research Council Research Project RP90. Finally, several suggestions are offered for further research in this vital area of system control.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "481", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "485", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "481 - 485", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Harold L.
