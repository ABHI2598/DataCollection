The first- and second-order moments of the system gain are expressed as a function of the first- and second-order component gain moments. Curves obtained from the resulting system gain variance equation are presented and special cases are discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "558", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "561", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "558 - 561", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
