The craft-borne processor, optimum in the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sense, is designed to estimate position coordinates using only the incoming radio signals, although improved estimates result if the other two items are available. An error analysis starts with the derivation of an estimation error covariance matrix, whose elements depend on additive receiver noise and the physical parameters of the system. A minimum 1\u00c2\u00bf estimation error in position is obtained by trading off these parameters. The effects of other major error sources, such as tropospheric phase fluctuations, multipath, and craft altitude uncertainty, are added to the estimation error to give a total 1\u00c2\u00bf position error on the order of 3.7 to 5.6 km.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "528", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "537", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "528 - 537", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["George R.
