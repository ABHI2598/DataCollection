The system includes an interrogator and a repeater operating on the same radio frequency, with a pulse repetition rate which is related to the distance. Single radio frequency operation allows utilization of a superregenerative radio frequency stage, which serves as both the receiver and the transmitter of the interrogator unit.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "541", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "545", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "541 - 545", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Nadav Levanon"], "keywords": ["Delay systems", "Microwave oscillators", "Pulse measurements", "Radio frequency", "Radio transmitters", "Receivers", "Repeaters", "Semiconductor diodes", "Timing", "Tuning", ""], "arnumber": "4102995"}
