This function, which is independent of operating frequency, permits high sampling frequencies. Combined with a limiter of the analog input, limitation characteristics are automatically available, without any extra sensing on the hot line. The independence of parameters f0 and \u00bf\u00bf1 is demonstrated, and application of the loop to control the regulator output characteristics is shown. This flexibility finds useful applications in high-power systems (1 kW) by permitting parallel unit operations and utilization of modular units.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "472", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "480", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "472 - 480", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
