The signals used the one-hop F lower ray mode to propagate a distance of 2600 km and were processed to yield equivalent aperture lengths of 10 km and 70 km. It was shown that apertures of up to 10 km in length could sometimes achieve their ideal free-space directivity without use of ionospheric compensation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "466", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "471", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "466 - 471", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["John T.
