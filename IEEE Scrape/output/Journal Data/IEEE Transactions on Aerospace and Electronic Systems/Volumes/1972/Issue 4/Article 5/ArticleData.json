The sensor is corrupted by thermal noise, generation-recombination noise, photon noise, and modulation noise, the latter providing an extreme discoloration in the signal passband. Expressions for the signal voltage density spectrum, signal pulse shape, noise power spectrum, and average noise power at the matched filter output are derived where the integral evaluations attendant to these derivations do not appear elsewhere in the literature. The paper also provides graphical displays of the signal-to-noise power ratio at the filter output versus various system parameters, noise power spectrum out of the matched filter versus \u00c2\u00bf, and the signal pulse shape out of the filter versus time. Also included are discussions of practically realizable approximations to the matched filters and curve fitting techniques for the signal pulse shape function.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "428", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "438", "date_publication": "July 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "428 - 438", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Richard Clow", "Eldon Hansen", "Frank Mcnolty"], "keywords": ["Matched filters", "Noise generators", "Noise shaping", "Optical modulation", "Optoelectronic and photonic sensors", "Power system modeling", "Pulse shaping methods", "Shape", "Signal generators", "Thermal sensors", ""], "arnumber": "4102981"}
