Three channels of polarization-modulated light are used to determine all three degrees of freedom of vehicle orientation. Two important system components are described, a polarization rotator and a retroreflector which leaves the polarization state invariant. Also, the method of data reduction is outlined and the system accuracy is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "156", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "160", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "156 - 160", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Thomas W.
