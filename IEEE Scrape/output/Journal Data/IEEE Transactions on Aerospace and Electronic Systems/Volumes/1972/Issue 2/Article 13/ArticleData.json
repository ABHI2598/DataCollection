The field of view of the radar is directly below and to either side of the aircraft. Resolution is realized in the along-track direction by utilizing the synthetic aperture technique, and in the cross-track direction by means of a phased receiving array. The theory of operation is summarized, the demonstration system is described, and results for both the normal and contouring modes of operation are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "208", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "217", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "208 - 217", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Richard W.
