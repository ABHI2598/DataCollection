Under a restriction that the amount of available energy was limited, general equations for operational hours of the energy source for given power output were derived for both continuous and pulse mode operations. This paper points out that due to various adjustable parameters available for pulse mode operation, if properly designed pulse mode operation produces longer utilization of available energy for required output power than continuous mode operation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "191", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "195", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "191 - 195", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["T.
