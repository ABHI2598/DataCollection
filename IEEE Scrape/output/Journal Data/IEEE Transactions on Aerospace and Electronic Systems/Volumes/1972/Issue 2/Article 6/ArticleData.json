The PEPE computer consists of a large number of identical processing elements which operate in parallel and are controlled by a common control unit. Each of the processing elements is assigned to a particular radar target such that many targets can be tracked in parallel. PEPE is designed to augment a conventional computer rather than to stand alone. The total data processing load associated with a radar tracking system is distributed between PEPE and the sequential machine in a manner than maximizes the overall system efficiency and desensitizes the system performance to fluctuations in traffic levels. The use of PEPE provides very high data processing throughput potential to a radar data processing system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "161", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "167", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "161 - 167", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
