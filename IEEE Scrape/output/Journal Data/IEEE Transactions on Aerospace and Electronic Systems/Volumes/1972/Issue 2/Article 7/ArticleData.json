The principle has actually been known for many years, but does not seem to be well known or widely used, possibly because of some associated computational difficulties. Some digital computer tabulated results are presented which remove these difficulties, and measurement techniques are discussed. The calculation of expected signal-to-noise ratio for radio and radar systems is briefly reviewed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "168", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "173", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "168 - 173", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Lamont V.
