Results obtained from the tests made on a three-phase induction motor with different solid-iron as well as composite rotors are presented. These are compared with the theoretically predicted characteristics based on existing analytical as well as numerical analyses.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "147", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "155", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "147 - 155", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Mulukutla S.
