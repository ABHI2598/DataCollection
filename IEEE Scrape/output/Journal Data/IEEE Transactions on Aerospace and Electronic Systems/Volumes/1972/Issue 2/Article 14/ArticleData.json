The optimal feedback controller is constructed for both players when all components of the state vector can be measured. For the case that only some components of the state vector are available, the optimal feedback controller is designed using a dynamic observer. As a specific application, the approach is used in determining the optimal feedback controllers for two satellites which are performing a rendezvous on a circular orbit. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the applicability of the approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "218", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "228", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "218 - 228", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
