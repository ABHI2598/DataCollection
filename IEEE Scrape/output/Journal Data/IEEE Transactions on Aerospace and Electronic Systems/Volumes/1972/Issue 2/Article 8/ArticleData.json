The noise fields {{Nm}} are independent, zero mean, white Gaussian fields, all independent of the background field {Y}; the latter is assumed to be either 1} completely unknown or of known mean and covariance functions with 2) a certain fluctuation property or 3) Gaussian. Three equivalent forms of the optimum processing are found: 1) a summation of generalized matched filterings of the images, 2) a summation of matched filtering of certain generalized differences of the images, 3) a summation of \u00c2\u00bfestimator-correlator\u00c2\u00bf type filterings. The detection performance and optimum signal/image selection under the Neyman-Pearson criterion is given and the singularity of the ({{Nm = O}} and M > 1) case noted. It is shown that optimum processor and signal design can completely eliminate any effect of the background on detectability (M > 1). The Cramer-Rao lower bound for the signal parameter estimates meansquare error is given along with an example; optimum signal/image selection in the single parameter case is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "174", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "185", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "174 - 185", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Robert O.
