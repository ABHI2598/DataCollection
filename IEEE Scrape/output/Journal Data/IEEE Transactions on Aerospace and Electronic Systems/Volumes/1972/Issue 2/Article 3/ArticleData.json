Some criticisms of existing procedures are enumerated and a new approach proposed. This approach allows for the incorporation of knowledge existing before the observations are made and provides simple computational procedures for obtaining both the a posteriori density function of the source position and an estimate of this position from the observed data.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "142", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "146", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "142 - 146", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Peter J.
