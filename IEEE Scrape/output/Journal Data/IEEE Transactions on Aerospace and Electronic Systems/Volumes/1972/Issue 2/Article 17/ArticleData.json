It is shown that for some cases the error in the approximation is quite large. This approximation is sometimes used to compare the relative merits of two alternate systems. The comparison might be erroneous if the system differences are comparable to the approximation errors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "246", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "247", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "246 - 247", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
