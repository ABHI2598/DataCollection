This system employs a modified conical scanning technique called Conscan. The signal processor, the most interesting unit of the system, is described in detail to show that it approximates a maximum likelihood estimator. The dynamic behavior of the spacecraft and the stability analysis of the system are presented, demonstrating that the system performance is basically determined by the open-loop phase and amplitude errors introduced by the antenna, receiver, and signal processor. A detailed error budget shows that the phase and amplitude errors are small. Finally, closed-loop simulation and test data are presented to verify the error budget.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "236", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "245", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "236 - 245", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["V.
