Both methods make use of landmarks which are in sight but whose positions are not known. Only angle measurements are needed. Although the methods were intended for guiding a Lunar Roving Vehicle as it travels on the lunar surface, they may also find applications on other planets as well as on Earth. Besides the mathematical details, two examples are also included to demonstrate the correctness of the method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "229", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "235", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "229 - 235", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
