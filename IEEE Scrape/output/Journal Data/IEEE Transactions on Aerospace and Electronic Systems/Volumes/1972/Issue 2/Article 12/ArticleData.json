Regularly spaced voice countdown, irregular voice countdown, initiation of a tone, and termination of a tone were each used as the stimulus. The individual under test was given a task similar to that involved in maintaining accurate flight conditions to occupy his attention. The regular voice countdown is shown to be least accurate in defining the switching time, providing a mean delay of approximately -0.09 second (actually a stimulus anticipation) and a standard deviation of a bit more than 0.2 second. In each of the other cases, a mean delay of approximately 0.25 second and a standard deviation of approximately 0.09 second were obtained. This compares favorably with previous experimental results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "205", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "207", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "205 - 207", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Virgil W.
