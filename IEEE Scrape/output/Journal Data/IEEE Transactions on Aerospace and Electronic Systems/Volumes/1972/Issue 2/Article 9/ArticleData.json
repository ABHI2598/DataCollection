Weak phase objects can be examined because optical path changes can be resolved to 0.1 \u00c3\u0085 with a time resolution of about 20 ns. Examples for different gas-dynamic investigations show good results and demonstrate the wide field of application for this type of laser interferometer.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "186", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "190", "date_publication": "March 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "186 - 190", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
