However, pressure gradients in the atmosphere can introduce significant errors. An improvement (which corrects for pressure gradient errors) has been developed which is based on the equilibrium equation for the motion of the air mass in the presence of pressure gradients.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "685", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "687", "date_publication": "Sept. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "685 - 687", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
