This CFAR receiver is capable of operating over a larger dynamic range of noise levels than a conventional cell averaging CFAR receiver, but with somewhat poorer detectability. The performance in stationary Gaussian noise of the cell averaging LOG/CFAR receiver with no post-detection integration is determined in this paper. For a small number of reference noise samples, results were obtained by a Monte Carlo simulation using the technique of importance sampling. For a large number of reference noise samples, a second moment analysis gave the desired results. Both these results can be summarized in the following simple formula, NLOG = 1.65NLIN - 0.65, which relates the number of reference samples required by each of the two receivers for equivalent performance. Thus, for the cell averaging LOG/CFAR receiver to give the same detection performance as the conventional cell averaging CFAR receiver, the number of reference noise samples has to be increased by up to 65 percent.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "648", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "652", "date_publication": "Sept. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "648 - 652", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["V.
