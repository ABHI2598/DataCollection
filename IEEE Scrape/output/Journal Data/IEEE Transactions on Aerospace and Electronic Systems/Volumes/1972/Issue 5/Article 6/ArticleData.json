The resulting integral is expressed in terms of the well-known Q function, which depends upon average signal, noise, and jamming powers. The analytical procedures used can be applied to the analysis of the effects of other types of jamming.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "609", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "614", "date_publication": "Sept. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "609 - 614", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ray H.
