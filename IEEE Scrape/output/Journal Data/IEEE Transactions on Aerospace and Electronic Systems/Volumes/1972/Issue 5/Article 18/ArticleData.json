Numerical calculations are made for power spectra thought to be appropriate for phase errors due to atmospheric turbulence. Both Gaussian and uniform illumination are considered, and the results obtained here are compared with those reported by Brown and Riordan [2].", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "687", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "690", "date_publication": "Sept. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "687 - 690", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Murray D.
