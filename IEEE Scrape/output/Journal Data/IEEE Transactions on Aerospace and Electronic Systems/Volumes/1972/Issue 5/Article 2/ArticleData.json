A mixed pre-assigned demand-assigned operation is assumed as a model, in which large standard stations use the demand-assigned system for their overflow traffic. Determination of the optimum percentage of overflow for each link and of the global satellite revenue and occupancy, in terms of a general traffic matrix, is carried out and then used in the specific case of the Atlantic satellites to establish demand-assignment and pre-assignment charges as a function of G/T, based on a cost per unit bandwidth criterion. The effects of various demand-assignment systems on the economic balance is also considered.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "583", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "590", "date_publication": "Sept. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "583 - 590", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["B.
