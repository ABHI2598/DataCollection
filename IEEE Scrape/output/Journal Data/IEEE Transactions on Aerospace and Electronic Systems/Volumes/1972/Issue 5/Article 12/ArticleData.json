When the signal value out of the mark filter is greater than that out of the space filter, it is decided that mark or 1 is transmitted, and vice versa. It is of fundamental importance to know the exact instant of time at which the two filter outputs are to be compared. This is the problem of synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper, we assume a system that is perfectly synchronized. In a practical system, the difference between the two filter outputs must differ from a threshold by some finite amount in order to cause the device to respond reliably. The examination of the effects of this dead zone (finite-width decision threshold) on digital transmission systems is of important practical interest. Its effects on binary differentially coherent phase-shift-keying, and m-level phase-shift-keying systems have been investigated previously. In this paper we consider its effects on binary coherent phase-shift-keying (CPSK), coherent orthogonal (CFSK), and noncoherent orthogonal (NCFSK) systems. The probability of bit error and the channel capacity of each system is obtained in terms of the dead zone threshold.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "653", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "660", "date_publication": "Sept. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "653 - 660", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jhong S.
