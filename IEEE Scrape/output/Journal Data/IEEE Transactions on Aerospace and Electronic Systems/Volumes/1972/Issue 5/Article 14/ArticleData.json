The results apply to situations such as automatic sighting devices for aircraft and helicopters, automatic camera aiming for airborne photography, etc. Basic mathematical relations, which govern all forms of such automatic pointing devices, are derived.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "669", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "675", "date_publication": "Sept. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "669 - 675", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
