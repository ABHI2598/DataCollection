The specific configuration considered is the direct raster scan readout of a satellite-mounted vidicon. Three types of smearing are considered: 1) linear uniform smearing, 2) linear nonuniform smearing, and 3) nonlinear smearing. The simplest type of smearing, linear uniform, has as its desmearing or inverse filter a circulating delay line (CDL) cascaded with a differentiator. An error analysis of this filter is presented along with an experimental simulation. Linear, non-uniform smearing characterized by the operator begin{equation*}int^{t}_{t-delta(t)}I(tau){ }{dtau}end{equation*} is considered next. Two possible realizations for the inverse filter are discussed as to accuracy and practicality. Finally, an error analysis is performed for the nonlinear smearing that results from a skewing of the raster scan.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "624", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "632", "date_publication": "Sept. 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "624 - 632", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["William S.
