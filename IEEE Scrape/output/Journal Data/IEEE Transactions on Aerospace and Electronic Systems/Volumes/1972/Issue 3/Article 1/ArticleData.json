Both conditions became feasible only during the last twenty years because of rapid technological progress. Some applications of the Doppler effect are described in connection with a number of modern radio-location systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "258", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "263", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "258 - 263", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ernst Kramar"], "keywords": ["Doppler effect", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Frequency measurement", "Linear antenna arrays", "Orbits", "Radio navigation", "Radio transmitters", "Satellite broadcasting", "Stability", "Velocity measurement", ""], "arnumber": "4102946"}
