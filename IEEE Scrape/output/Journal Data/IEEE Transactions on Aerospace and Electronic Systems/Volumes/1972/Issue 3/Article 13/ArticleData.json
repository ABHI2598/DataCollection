Results are obtained that provide effective least-mean-squared-error estimation of the input message when errors which do not represent loss of information are neglected. These results, which differ appreciably from the results that obtain from a deterministic analysis, indicate that there are certain values of the propagation parameters which narrow the filter passband to such an extent that estimation is rendered ineffective.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "350", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "354", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "350 - 354", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["L.
