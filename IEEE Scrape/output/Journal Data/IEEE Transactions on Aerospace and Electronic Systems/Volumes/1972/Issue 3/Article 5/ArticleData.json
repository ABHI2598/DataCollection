Knowledge of the gyro transfer function is necessary for the purpose of servo analysis of the system in which the gyro is used; also, the transfer function is a basis of evaluation of errors caused by angular inputs that occur at twice spin frequency.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "280", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "288", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "280 - 288", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Robert J.
