It was further suggested that the loss in decibels as compared to a square-law detector would appear to be proportional to the logarithm of the number of pulses integrated. In this correspondence we show that this \u00c2\u00bfconjecture\u00c2\u00bf is false, and that the additional loss when N becomes very large approaches a constant value of 2.2 dB.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "386", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "388", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "386 - 388", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["V.
