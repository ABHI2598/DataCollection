Data are presented to illustrate the accuracy with which predictions can be made. Results obtained from the actual ballistic equations, from the time-varying perturbation equations, and from a time-invariant approximation of the perturbation equations are compared. It is shown that reasonable impact point predictive accuracy can be provited for fairly large changes in initial conditions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "338", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "344", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "338 - 344", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Edward A.
