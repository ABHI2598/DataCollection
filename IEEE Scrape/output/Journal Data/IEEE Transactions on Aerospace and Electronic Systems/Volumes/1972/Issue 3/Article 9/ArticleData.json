Each satellite has noise-corrupted output measurements and uses a Kalman filter to generate the best estimate of the states describing the rendezvous. The optimal control for the satellites is determined. A comparison is made in terms of dimensionality and complexity to a deterministic solution of the rendezvous problem.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "319", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "326", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "319 - 326", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
