The gyro angular transfer function, derived in [1], serves as an excellent basis of evaluation of errors due to asymmetries of the gimballing system and effects of rotor angular offsets. The gyro translational transfer function, derived in this paper, may be used in the analysis of errors caused by linear acceleration inputs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "289", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "297", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "289 - 297", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Robert J.
