This paper presents an approximate method for determining the suppressor requirements that disregards the generating system impedance. When a voltage surge due to removal of load is suppressed, the greater portion of the removed load current is transferred to the shunt-type suppressor. The influence of generating system voltage regulator design on severity of voltage transients is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "372", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "376", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "372 - 376", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
