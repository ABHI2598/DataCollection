It is demonstrated that errors due to interference during early booster flight are recovered from at booster cutoff; interference produced errors occurring shortly before cutoff are not recovered; and modulating the gain of one spaceborne antenna is beneficial to guidance in the interference region.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "377", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "381", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "377 - 381", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
