The design of DABS requires knowledge of the tracking accuracy obtainable as a function of various system parameters. In particular, the potential value of air-to-ground telemetry of turn-rate data and its effect on intermittent positive control (IPC) must be assessed. The design of DABS tracking algorithms is discussed, and the results obtained with a Kalman tracker simulation are given. The major finding is that turn-rate telemetry of moderate accuracy can improve tracking by a factor of 6 to 10.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "298", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "305", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "298 - 305", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Paul J.
