The error in pointing is directly related to successful operation of the tracking device; therefore, its behavior is of interest. For a tracker with a general polynomial nonlinearity, an arbitrary initial pointing error, and a bounded deterministic input, a method is developed for finding upper bounds on the magnitude of the tracking error using Volterra series techniques. Convergence regions of the Volterra series are also obtained. Applications of these results are made to a second-order tracking device.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "306", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "318", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "306 - 318", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Mark Landau", "C.
