The landmarks are assumed to be within sight of the navigator but with unknown positions. Both methods require computations which are time consuming when a computer is not available. This correspondence presents the concept of a new navigation device called \u00c2\u00bflandmark navigation rule\u00c2\u00bf which eliminates all the computation effort required in both new methods. The device is simple in construction, lightweight, and consumes no power.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "388", "volume": "AES-8", "lastpage": "391", "date_publication": "May 1972", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1972", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "388 - 391", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
