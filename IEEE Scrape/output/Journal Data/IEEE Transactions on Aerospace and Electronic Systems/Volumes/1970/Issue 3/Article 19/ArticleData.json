If a synthetic-array radar flies past the plate the resulting image is dependent upon what part of this lobe structure is sampled. When the plate is parallel to the flight path, the image is a line as wide as the plate. If the plate is not parallel, only the discontinuities at the ends of the plate are visible in the image.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "395", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "398", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "395 - 398", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["E.
