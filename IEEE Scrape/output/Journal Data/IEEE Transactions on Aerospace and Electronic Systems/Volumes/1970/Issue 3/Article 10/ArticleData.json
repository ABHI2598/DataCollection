It is desirable that this transducer should utilize components which are both available and needed for other purposes in the system. Thus, this investigation is limited to gyros. The nature of the errors in rate and rate-integrating gyros and their ac pick-offs are investigated. Finally, a method of obtaining satisfactory outputs from a set of rateintegrating gyros is developed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "344", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "358", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "344 - 358", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["John Dubbury"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Demodulation", "Frequency", "Image intensifiers", "Isolators", "Optical attenuators", "Optical filters", "Servomechanisms", "TV", "Transducers", ""], "arnumber": "4103521"}
