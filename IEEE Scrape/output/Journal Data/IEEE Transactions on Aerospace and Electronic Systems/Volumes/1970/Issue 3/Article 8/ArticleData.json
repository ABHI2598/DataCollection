In this paper, it is shown that for equally likely binary sequences (M= 2) of anticorrelated patterns for signals observed in additive Gaussian noise, a device that computes p\u00c2\u00bf|X1, X2, XK) can be synthesized from a correlator, a simple instantaneous nonlinearity, and a multiplier. These results are used to derive some equally simple structures for various optimum nonsupervised estimators, pattern recognition machines, and signal detectors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "334", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "339", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "334 - 339", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Paul A.
