These utilities now require about one third of the budgets of all major cities and are rapidly increasing in cost. Technological innovation in these systems has been minor, yet they are the aspects of urban function most sensitive to technological change. Systems engineering, using criteria based upon urban development needs, and large scale demonstration programs affords the best opportunity for development of utility technologies that satisfy rather than limit urban development and social organization.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "387", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "392", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "387 - 392", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Richard M.
