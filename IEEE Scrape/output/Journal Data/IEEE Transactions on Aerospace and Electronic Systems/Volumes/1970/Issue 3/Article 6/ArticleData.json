Monte Carlo simulation results are complemented by analysis of the filtering processes and curves are presented which clearly define the deterioration in filter performance attributable to reduced probabilities of data acquisition. In addition, the responses of \u00c2\u00bf-\u00c3\u009f and Kalman filters are shown to be identical when the \u00c2\u00bf, \u00c3\u009f gains are selected optimally.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "313", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "323", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "313 - 323", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Alien J.
