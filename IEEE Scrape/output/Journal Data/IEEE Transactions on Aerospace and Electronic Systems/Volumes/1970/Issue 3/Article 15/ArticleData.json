By formulating such a general theory of urban structural development, urban political, social, and economic leadership may be given the means by which permanent remedies\u00c2\u00bfincluding technological\u00c2\u00bfmay be devised and applied. This paper presents examples of such means and explains their application and effects.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "377", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "381", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "377 - 381", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
