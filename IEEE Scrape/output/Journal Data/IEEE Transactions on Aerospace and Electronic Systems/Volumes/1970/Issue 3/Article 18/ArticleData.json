Formulas are derived that allow one to predict system performance with the effects of both predetection and postdetection filtering accounted for. In particular, for a postdetection equivalent noise bandwidthbit time product b0T=2, it is shown that best results are obtained with a modulation index \u00c3\u009f=0.6. Furthermore, it is shown that performance to within 1.5 dB of theoretical can be obtained.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "393", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "395", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "393 - 395", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Marvin S.
