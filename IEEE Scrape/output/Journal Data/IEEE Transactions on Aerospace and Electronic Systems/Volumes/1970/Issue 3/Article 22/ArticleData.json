The \"hedgehog\" antenna consists of several antennas directed in different directions to cover the whole sky. An electronic switch, controlled by the satellite receiver, connects the receiver to the antenna from which the desired satellite signal is obtained. This system is especially suitable for unmanned reliable receiving stations if an antenna gain of the order of 10 dB is enough.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "405", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "407", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "405 - 407", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kalevi Kalliomaki", "Martti Tiuri"], "keywords": ["Automatic control", "Directive antennas", "Low pass filters", "Pulse amplifiers", "Receiving antennas", "Satellite antennas", "Signal to noise ratio", "Switches", "Switching circuits", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "4103533"}
