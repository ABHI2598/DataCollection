The algorithm consists of a global mode, which uses dynamic programming and terrain information available from photo reconnaissance data to determine a nominal optimal path, and a local mode, which routes the vehicle around obstacles whose presence, location, and extent are not known in advance. Gaussian probability density functions are used to simulate terrain for examples that illustrate the performance of the algorithm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "290", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "294", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "290 - 294", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Donald E.
