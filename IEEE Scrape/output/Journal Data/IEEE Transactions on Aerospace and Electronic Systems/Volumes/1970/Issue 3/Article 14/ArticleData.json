The Model Urban Neighborhood Demonstration Program, operating in an inner-city poverty neighborhood in Baltimore, offers some lessons in this regard. With the present state of the art, the techniques of systems analysis are most effective at the subsystem level, and the necessary funding and development time should be afforded to extend their usefulness in the civil order. Existing aerospace companies provide an operating institutional base, with extenasive resources, that can be beneficially translated to solving problems in the public order.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "373", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "376", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "373 - 376", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["W.
