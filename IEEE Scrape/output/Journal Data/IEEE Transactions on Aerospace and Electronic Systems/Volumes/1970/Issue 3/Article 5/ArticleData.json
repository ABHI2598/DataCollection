Upper and lower bounds of the PI about a nominal value are determined by the application of the optimum control theory. A computational procedure is also proposed to determine an approximately optimal feedback controller for time-lag systems. Such a controller is designed here on the basis of min-max criteria. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "306", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "312", "date_publication": "May 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "306 - 312", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
