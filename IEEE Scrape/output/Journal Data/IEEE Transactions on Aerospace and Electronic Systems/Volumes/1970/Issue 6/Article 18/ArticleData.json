Measurements are all made using a single station of the NASA Deep Space Network. One coordinate of the fix is derived from a ranging measurement, and the other coordinate is derived from observation on earth of the polarization of a signal radiated from a linearly polarized antenna on the balloon, aligned to vertical by balloon local gravity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "854", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "855", "date_publication": "Nov. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "854 - 855", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
