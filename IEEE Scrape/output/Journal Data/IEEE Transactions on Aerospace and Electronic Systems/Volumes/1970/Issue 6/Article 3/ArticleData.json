The calculations show that the observed errors are mostly caused by the measuring instruments. The propagation errors are mainly caused by increases, decreases, or fluctuations of the refractive index of the atmosphere, and the errors caused by the refraction of the propagation path are about 10 percent of the errors caused by the decrease of the propagation velocity. The tropospheric range errors are less than 150 meters and are approximately expressed by a cotangent function, and they are reduced by about 90 percent through the use of monthly average refractivity profiles of the troposphere. The ionospheric errors are usually negligible at centimeter radio waves (less than 10 cm), and even at decimeter waves or meter waves almost all errors can be removed by the use of two different frequencies on the down-link so that the range can be made independent of frequency.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "770", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "779", "date_publication": "Nov. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "770 - 779", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kozo Takahiashi"], "keywords": ["Artificial satellites", "Atmospheric measurements", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Frequency", "Instruments", "Ionosphere", "Refractive index", "Satellite broadcasting", "Satellite ground stations", "Terrestrial atmosphere", ""], "arnumber": "4103619"}
