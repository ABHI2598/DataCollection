One of many available CAD languages is the electronic circuit analysis program (ECAP). The ECAP language is divided into three sections, dc-analysis. acanalysis, and transient analysis. The three modes of ECAP together with fast computer access provide a helpful tool for the design engineer. Following is a typical problem of oscillatory transients encountered in line-type modulators. The solution to the problem is a model of sufficient correlation with the observed oscillation as an aid to find a network which will critically damp the oscillation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "851", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "854", "date_publication": "Nov. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "851 - 854", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Frederick Bluemel"], "keywords": ["Damping", "Electrons", "Frequency", "Inductors", "Pulse amplifiers", "Pulse compression methods", "Pulse modulation", "Radar", "Transmitters", "Voltage", ""], "arnumber": "4103633"}
