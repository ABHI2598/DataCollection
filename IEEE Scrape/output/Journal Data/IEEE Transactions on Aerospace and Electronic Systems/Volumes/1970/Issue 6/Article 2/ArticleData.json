The damper described here makes use of a wheel of uniform mass distribution. The wheel experiences torques which are produced by inertial forces. Damping and restoring (spring) torques are provided by means of a torsional arrangement built around the center of the wheel. The performance characteristics of the above nutation damper are evaluated by considering the small astronomy satellite (SAS-A) spacecraft parameters, and the results for an optimum design of the damper are presented. Finally, the result for the optimum performance is checked with the help of an approximate analysis.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "764", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "769", "date_publication": "Nov. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "764 - 769", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Asim K.
