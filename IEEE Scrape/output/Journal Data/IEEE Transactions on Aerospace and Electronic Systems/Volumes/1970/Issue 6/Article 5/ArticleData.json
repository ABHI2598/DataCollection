This makes it possible to design Huffman pulse sequences which are suitable for use as radar or sonar signals in situations where significant target velocity occurs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "790", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "796", "date_publication": "Nov. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "790 - 796", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Martin H.
