Test results for conventional 5-grid silicon cells, for specially designed 13-grid silicon cells, and for a GaAs cell are presented parametrically for the illumination intensity range from 0.07 to 2.8 W/cm2 and the temperature range from 30 to 1 50\u00c2\u00b0C. The data cover the 3 points on the currentvoltage characteristic required to reconstruct the full characteristic in the power-generating quadrant. The 13-grid silicon cells showed much better performance than the GaAs cell.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "797", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "803", "date_publication": "Nov. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "797 - 803", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Werner Luft"], "keywords": ["Aerospace materials", "Aerospace testing", "Electronic equipment testing", "Gallium arsenide", "Lighting", "Photovoltaic cells", "Photovoltaic systems", "Silicon", "Solar power generation", "Temperature distribution", ""], "arnumber": "4103622"}
