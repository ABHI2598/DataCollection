This is the largest drawback of passive navigation and it would be more desirable if the user could find his position by a mere glance at a chart and table, as one uses Loran. The first step toward this goal is to use a synchronous satellite because it simplifies the problem. The next step is to find the position of the user by a Loran type of chart, which is universal, and correct this apparent position by looking at a special table which is made according to the amount of perturbation of both the satellite and the user's position. An example of the position fix along the route between Yokohama to Hawaii is shown. The concept can be extended to orbiting satellites due to the rules which govern the motion of satellites, if the fix accuracy is in the order of 2 to 5 miles. This method should be more accurate than the common sextant and more practical due to the fact that the satellite can be used at any time and in any weather. As a total system, it will be better than Omega because it could provide additional navigation information such as communication or traffic control by using satellites.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "780", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "789", "date_publication": "Nov. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "780 - 789", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Haruyoshi Kuno", "Yukio Hata"], "keywords": ["Application software", "Artificial satellites", "Boats", "Earth", "Ellipsoids", "Geometry", "Orbital calculations", "Satellite navigation systems", "Traffic control", ""], "arnumber": "4103620"}
