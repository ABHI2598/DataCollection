Because of the need for feasible distribution of data to space and ground users over long-term flight conditions, emphasis has been placed on the preliminary concepts for onboard data processing and autonomous information handling combined with only single-point ground distribution. The requirements for such extensive critical data-distribution capabilities have been established from preliminary estimates.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "746", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "763", "date_publication": "Nov. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "746 - 763", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Andrew Adelman", "A.
