Printing and publishing and allied fields involved in graphic communications have been changing rapidly in this decade as the digital computer and associated peripheral devices have made rapid inroads in the graphic communications process. This paper describes the nature of the impact which the digital computer has had, and is making, upon today's graphic communications, particularly upon the editing and composition functions. A prediction of future impact is also presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "804", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "810", "date_publication": "Nov. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "804 - 810", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
