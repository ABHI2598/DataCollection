Based on the exploration of polyominoes, the initial message is submitted to a well-defined information extraction process at the transmitter and a corresponding reconstruction manipulation for message display at the receiver.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "811", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "814", "date_publication": "Nov. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "811 - 814", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Peter Stucki"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Displays", "Filtering", "Filters", "Graphics", "Humans", "Laboratories", "Redundancy", "Shape", "Transmitters", ""], "arnumber": "4103624"}
