S. Air Force placed into synchronous orbit the largest communications satellite built to date. This vehicle, the tactical communications satellite (TACSAT), together with a variety of ground terminals, is designed to test experimentally and develop tactical communications concepts for all military services. This paper describes the spacecraft design focusing on the communications repeater. Measured performance characteristics affecting communications utilization of the spacecraft are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "432", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "441", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "432 - 441", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Richard D.
