In this way the computation of \u00c2\u00bf becomes much easier than with previously known formulas. A formula allowing the computation of the expected number of cycles gained or lost per second is also given. These results are obtained by extending a technique used by Viterbi. The outcome of experimental verifications of the theory is also reported.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "484", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "490", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "484 - 490", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Enrico A.
