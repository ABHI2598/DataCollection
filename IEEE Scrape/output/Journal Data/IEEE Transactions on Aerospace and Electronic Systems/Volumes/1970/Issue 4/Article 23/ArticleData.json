A gas-tube isolator circuit is proposed wherein the tube is programmed to charge the individual secondary capacitance bank of each amplifier during the interpulse interval. Since the gas tube is nonconducting during the pulsing period of the amplifier, it isolates the amplifier from the rest of the system in case of a fault.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "593", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "594", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "593 - 594", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Sol Schneider"], "keywords": ["Capacitance", "Circuits", "Isolators", "Operational amplifiers", "Phased arrays", "Power amplifiers", "Power supplies", "Radio frequency", "Switches", "Voltage", ""], "arnumber": "4103570"}
