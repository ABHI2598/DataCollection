In this paper an alternate approach is described, using results of Rao and Bhattacharyya from the statistical literature, which reduce the specified prediction problem to a simple one requiring no formal minimizations and no use of Lagrange multipliers. It further has the advantage of yielding the covariances between estimates of the polynomial and its derivates. Useful engineering formulas for smoothing and prediction are developed in the main part of the paper. These include both filter and covariance expressions. A tutorial discussion of the theory is given in two appendixes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "534", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "543", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "534 - 543", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Peyton Z.
