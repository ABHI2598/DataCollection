Information is presented on voltage transients as specified in MIL-STD-704 for aircraft and MIL-STD-1275(AT) for military ground vehicles and the ability of advanced high power Zener diodes in suppressing the levels of voltages specified therein. A complete transient suppressor capable of operating externally to the equipment intended for protection is also described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "498", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "502", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "498 - 502", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bernard Reich", "John Erickson"], "keywords": ["Aerospace electronics", "Breakdown voltage", "Diodes", "Electric variables", "Fuses", "Land vehicles", "Military aircraft", "Military standards", "Power supplies", "Surge protection", ""], "arnumber": "4103558"}
