Potential experiment programs identified to date in various NASA-and contractor-sponsored studies have been reviewed in order to define critical values and ranges for the following pointing/stability parameters: 1) pointing accuracy, 2) line-of-sight stability, 3) angular rate, and/or 4) acceleration level. The most stringent requirements were found to be in the research categories of: stellar and solar astronomy, earth observations, space physics, communications and navigation, and space biology.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "556", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "564", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "556 - 564", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Harry L.
