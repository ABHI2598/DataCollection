While for stationary targets the resulting differential equations of motion can be readily integrated, this is no longer the case for moving targets. To obtain closed-form expressions convenient for the evaluation of trajectory parameters, the assumption is made in this paper that for moving targets, the angular rate of the closing velocity vector is made proportional to the line of sight rather than the actual heading rate.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "455", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "457", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "455 - 457", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kurt Arbenz"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Closed-form solution", "Differential equations", "Integral equations", "Kinematics", "Missiles", "Navigation", "Trajectory", "Velocity control", "Weapons", ""], "arnumber": "4103552"}
