A concise proof is given for bounds on this error (either mean square or mean absolute value). This proof requires no assumptions regarding source distribution or number of quantization levels. If the code is orthogonal or transorthogonal, the bounds coincide with results obtained earlier by Clark and Totty for the case of 2N quantization levels, a natural binary code, and transmission through a binary symmetric channel.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "597", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "598", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "597 - 598", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Malvern K.
