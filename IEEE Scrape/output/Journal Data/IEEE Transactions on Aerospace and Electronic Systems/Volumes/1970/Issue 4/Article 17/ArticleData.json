Thus, a single redundancy system of four gyros greatly enhances system reliability. The orientation of the sensitive axes of four gyros is specified and means of generating outputs dependent only on gyro inconsistencies are defined. The voting logic and plots of switching decision zones are developed. The hardware required to implement this logic is shown to be simple and thus reliable. The use of rate integrating gyros requires the limitation of error integration time in order to avoid spurious failure signals. This is achieved by a reset cycle which realigns the four gyros at regular intervals. False error signals can be generated if inputs are large enough to exceed linear ranges of various components downstream of the gyros.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "544", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "550", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "544 - 550", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["John Dubbuyr"], "keywords": ["Aerospace electronics", "Electronic voting", "Hardware", "Logic", "Radar detection", "Redundancy", "Reliability", "Signal generators", "Switches", ""], "arnumber": "4103564"}
