This leakage reactance equation, or objective function, is then minimized under suitable constraints. Geometric programming is used to carry through the optimization procedure. A computer program is developed and applied to find the optimum leakage reactance for a 95 kVA, 208 V, wye-connected, 40 800 r/min aerospace alternator, using 8-, 10-, and 12-pole machines.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "491", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "497", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "491 - 497", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kurt F.
