For this reason, a parametrical method is proposed which condenses the elements necessary for this calculation in the form of three abaci. Furthermore, a general formula condenses this result, and the formula is extended to the other transmission systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "514", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "521", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "514 - 521", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
