Systems characteristics and mission requirements for space station logistics have been analyzed within the context of a broad spectrum of space missions. Preliminary concepts for a space shuttle system (space transportation) have been developed. This system can support not only a space station program, but a wide variety of space missions for both NASA and the DOD.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "565", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "574", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "565 - 574", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Leroy E.
