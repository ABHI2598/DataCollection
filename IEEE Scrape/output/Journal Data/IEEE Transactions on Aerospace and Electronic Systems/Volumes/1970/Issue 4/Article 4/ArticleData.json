A barometric altitude signal is divided by slant-range information from a DME interrogator. The resulting ground-based angle is subtracted from the selected approach angle to provide the displayed departure from the glide path. Angular and lineal outputs are available. DME station position may be electrically offset to serve all airdrome runways. Theoretical and experimental results are presented", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "450", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "454", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "450 - 454", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Paitrick H.
