The MLM has an active area of 4 by 4 mm containing a 32 by 74 array of 2368 38-pm diameter light modulating elements. The optical computer calculates the one-dimensional Fourier transform over 32 points of a phase function in 1 \u00c2\u00bfs. Both the theoretical and actual operating characteristics of the computer are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "458", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "467", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "458 - 467", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kendall Preston"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Dielectric substrates", "High speed optical techniques", "Laser radar", "Optical computing", "Optical films", "Optical modulation", "Optical surface waves", "Phase modulation", "Transducers", ""], "arnumber": "4103553"}
