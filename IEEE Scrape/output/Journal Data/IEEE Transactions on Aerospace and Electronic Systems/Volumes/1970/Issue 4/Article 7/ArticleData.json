Mode of scattering in ZnO has been determined by studying the temperature dependence of various electrical parameters in the range from -170 to 120\u00c2\u00b0C. It has been observed that the degradation to the crystals by UV irradiation is limited only to the surface layer and shows up only at relatively lower temperatures, which is in contrast to the degradation behavior in thin films and powders.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "468", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "472", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "468 - 472", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Arun P.
