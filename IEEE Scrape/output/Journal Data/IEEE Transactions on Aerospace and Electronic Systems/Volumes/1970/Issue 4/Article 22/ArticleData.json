Two approaches are described. One is a global fit technique in which the parameters of an assumed trajectory model are estimated. The second is a pointwise mapping technique in which the trajectory estimate is extrapolated as the target tracking data is received. The paper provides a tutorial illustration of the direct application of recursive optimization techniques to a class of engineering problems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "585", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "592", "date_publication": "July 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "585 - 592", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Sheldon N.
