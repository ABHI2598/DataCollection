The marketplaces are varied and in a state of flux. Nevertheless, personal entrepreneurship as exemplified by high technology efforts in the aerospace, computer, and electronics industries is essential and identified as a basic American characteristic. Individuals and corporations are challenged to channel their efforts and organization to attack broad social objectives, currently recogned but awaiting clarification and polarization of the environment, to allow technology, via effective concept engineering, to participate in the achievement of successes equal to those attained in consumer products, defense engineering, and space exploration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "112", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "118", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "112 - 118", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hanns J.
