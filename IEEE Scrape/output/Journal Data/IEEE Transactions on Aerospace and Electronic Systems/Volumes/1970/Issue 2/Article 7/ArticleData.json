System designers now have the capability of serving thousands of simultaneous users; the users need not all follow the same system parameters. Diversity and characteristics are shown, and an attempt is made to list all the parameters desired by users. Usage of satellite communications systems is projected to serve a maximum of 200 000 users by means of 10 multipurpose satellites. It is shown that a supervisory control system is necessary to achieve optimal utilization of the existing resources.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "165", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "172", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "165 - 172", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
