Nuclear power systems include the range below 10 kW, with an electrical output to weight ratio of 0.5 to 1.0 pounds per watt. Comparisons show that primary batteries are lighter for short-duration missions of a few hours; fuel cells are lighter for durations of one to two months; and solar-cell/secondary battery combinations are to be preferred when sunlight is adequate.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "147", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "164", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "147 - 164", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Joseph D.
