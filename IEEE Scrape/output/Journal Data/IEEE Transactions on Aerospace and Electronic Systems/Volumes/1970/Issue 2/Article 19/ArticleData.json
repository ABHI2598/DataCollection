For a typical set of IRIG (inter-range instrumentation group) channels, it is demonstrated that the required carrier signal-to-noise ratio can be as low as 5 dB (much less than the conventional 12 dB value) in order to maintain the subcarrier signal-to-noise ratio at 12 dB, the threshold level. comparison of the optimized and the conventional taper analysis is tabulated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "254", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "257", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "254 - 257", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Chi-hau Chen", "Raymond J.
