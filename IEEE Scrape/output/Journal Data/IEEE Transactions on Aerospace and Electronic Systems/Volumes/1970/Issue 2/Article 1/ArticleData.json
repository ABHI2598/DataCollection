Emphasis was placed on major terminal areas and on the denser portions of the enroute airspace where the need for efficient use of scarce resources (principally runways and terminal airspace) and the danger of mid-air collisions make sophisticated air traffic control mandatory if safety is to be assured without sacrifice of capacity. Airports were included in the study insofar as they strongly interact with air traffic control, and then, primarily, the committee's concern was with efficient use of runways. No work was done on airport access. Considerable effort was placed on the subject of noise reduction which may be critical to community acceptance of high-capacity airports.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "106", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "111", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "106 - 111", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ben Alexander"], "keywords": ["Aerospace control", "Air safety", "Air traffic control", "Air transportation", "Airports", "Costs", "Military aircraft", "NASA", "Noise reduction", "Road accidents", ""], "arnumber": "4103482"}
