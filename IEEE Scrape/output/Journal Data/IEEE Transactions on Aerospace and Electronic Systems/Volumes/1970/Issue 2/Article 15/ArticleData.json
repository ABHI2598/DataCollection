The comparison source is a stationary, zero-mean white noise generator of known spectral density. An expression for the power spectrum at the output of the radiometer is derived. It is shown that measurement errors due to interchannel coupling can be corrected by phase switching. Radiometer sensitivity is also calculated. The switched version of the radiometer has been simulated at low frequencies and is under construction at X-band.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "239", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "247", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "239 - 247", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
