A performance analysis is carried out, which takes into account both the radiation pattern of the antenna and the dynamic character of the detection process due to the angular scanning of the antenna. An expression for the false alarm rate of the detector is first derived and evaluated numerically. The detection performance and angular accuracy are next determined in a direct Monte Carlo simulation of the detector on a digital computer for both no fading and pulse-to-pulse Rayleigh fading. Finally the influence on detection performance of the width used for the moving window is investigated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "173", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "179", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "173 - 179", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["V.
