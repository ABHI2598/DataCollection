The signal fading is assumed to follow the popular Rayleigh distribution, but generalizations tions to non-Rayleigh fading are included in terms of the \" in\" distribution due to Nakagami. The channel observation time is allowed to be either predetermined or variable (corresponding, respectively, to \" fixed sample size\" and \" sequential\" reception), and the practically important situation of intermittent signal transmissions is also examined. Results are in the form of optimal and near-optimal receiver structures, and of measures of performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "228", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "238", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "228 - 238", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["N.
