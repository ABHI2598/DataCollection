One of the motivations of our research has been the attempt to increase the channel capacity by representing information by the interval between pulses instead of the presence or absence of pulses. A second motivation is the desire to find a practical use for microelectronic devices now under development which may encompass a billion gates in a cubic inch. The third motivation is the similarity between the nervous system and a Time Interval Modulation Information Coding system (TIMIC). In our initial studies we have utilized an operational element, called \"sumister,\" which is essentially a model of an artificial neuron interpreted as a decision-making threshold device with the ability of temporal and spacial summation and short-term memory. Five basic component networks have been designed, the ON cell, the OFF cell, a conjunctive network, an object-detection network, and an autocorrelation network. These are combined into moving-object detection networks and a metaphase-chromosome detection network.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "221", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "227", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "221 - 227", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["George C.
