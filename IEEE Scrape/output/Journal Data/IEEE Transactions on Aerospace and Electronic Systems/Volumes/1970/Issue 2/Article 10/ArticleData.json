Performance is analyzed to determine the effects of channel multipath structure (multipath delay and signal power division among the paths), space-time correlation properties of the incident processes, and the array spacing. It is shown by a series of case studies, that for single element coupling, as well as array coupling, an increased multipath delay factor results in decreased system detectability for fixed signal and noise intensity levels. The performance capacity is degraded as the available signal power tends to distribute more uniformly between the paths. These effects are attributed to the loss of effective signal energy concentration, resulting in a lower effective pre-detection signal-to-noise ratio. An investigation of the effects upon system performance, due to array element spacing, shows that performance is enhanced by increasing the spacing relative to the multipath delay factor and the reciprocal signal bandwidth. The former is the result of a more directive detectability (beam) pattern arising from the increased spacing. In effect, with increased spacing, the main lobe of the pattern is narrowed, while the side lobes are optimally suppressed by the required noise related array element link, frequency filters (weights).", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "188", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "199", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "188 - 199", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
