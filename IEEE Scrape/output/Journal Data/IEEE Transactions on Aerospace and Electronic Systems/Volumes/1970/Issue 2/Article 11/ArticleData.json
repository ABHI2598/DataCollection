This paper deals with the effectiveness of integral relay operations based on the assumption of random spatial distribution of aircraft. It describes the development of a control sector line-of-sight (LOS) model and of a methodology for effectiveness analysis, and the application of the methodology to one numerical example. It is shown that the LOS conditions in the control sector may be represented by two LOS characteristics which are functions of both aircraft clearance and the terrain and FOC characteristics. Probabilities of direct and indirect (via relay) LOS between the FOC and randomly located aircraft are derived for operations without and with integral relay. The effectiveness, expressed as an increase in LOS probability, is a function of aircraft density and the above two LOS characteristics and is representative of the control sector as a whole. Numerical results are obtained by probability analysis and statistical sampling.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "200", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "211", "date_publication": "March 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "200 - 211", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Karl F.
