This paper reviews the sources of pointing error in precision gimbaled pointing systems and describes the techniques for determining them. In particular, a method of calibration that is suitable for systems in which constraints on gimbal travel preclude the use of conventional calibration procedures is presented, and the pointing readout accuracy that can be achieved by this method is evaluated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "697", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "706", "date_publication": "Sept. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "697 - 706", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Arthur K.
