The phase error description follows directly from Tatarski's theory of wave propagation through turbulence; for most situations of interest, the phase error is Gaussian with stationary first increments. The structure function of the phase error is a function of the radar parameters and of the vertical profile Cnm(h) of the microwave refractive index structure constant of the turbulence. A closed form expression for best attainable resolution can then be given as a function of these same parameters, via the results of a phase error analysis by Brown and Riordan. Published data on Cnm(h) and its optical-region counterpart are reviewed. The data from a recent microwave propagation experiment by Thompson and Janes are then analyzed and are consistent with the order-of-magnitude estimates of Cnm: Some unsolved problems associated with applying the results to synthetic-aperture systems are discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "636", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "644", "date_publication": "Sept. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "636 - 644", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Leonard J.
