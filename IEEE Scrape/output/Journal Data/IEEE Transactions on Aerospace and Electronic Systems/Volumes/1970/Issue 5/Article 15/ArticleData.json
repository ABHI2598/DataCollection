Unilateral and bilateral time domain amplitude weighting for sidelobe reduction is included. A general cross-ambiguity function is defined to include these effects and some basic computed results are presented for the peak envelope response with various degrees of Hamming weighting. Computer evaluation of this cross-ambiguity function allows one to choose a combination of mismatches for signal design trade-off between resolution and detection performance. Since no restrictions are placed upon the mismatch parameters, this analysis may also be used to evaluate the filter discrimination against various interfering signals.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "708", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "712", "date_publication": "Sept. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "708 - 712", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Stanley A.
