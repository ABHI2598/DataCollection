It is shown that this technique is readily adapted to angle tracking radars. The features of conventional monopulse operation are preserved while permitting precise angle tracking of noise sources when signal to noise ratios are much less than unity. Measurements, using a four-horn monopulse feed with a 28-foot parabolic reflector and a \"monopulse radiometer\" produced the characteristic monopulse angle detection functions when using the sun, the moon, and Cassiopeia A as boresight reference sources. Precision measurements were made to 8 arc second under varying weather conditions using 28-foot radio astronomy antennas. The accuracy of the measurements were limited by the antenna angle encoders, consequently no conclusions are drawn with regard to the absolute accuracy of the measurements. The celestial coordinates of four discrete radio sources and the equations for coordinate transformation to local elevation and azimuth are contained in the Appendixes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "663", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "671", "date_publication": "Sept. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "663 - 671", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Donald I.
