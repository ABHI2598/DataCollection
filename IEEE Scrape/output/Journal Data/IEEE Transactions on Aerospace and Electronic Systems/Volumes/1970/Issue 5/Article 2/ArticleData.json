A pit was constructed containing a 32-foot diameter antenna. Measurements are reported which indicate a shielding advantage of at least 25 dB. A siting example under actual conditions is given.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "612", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "619", "date_publication": "Sept. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "612 - 619", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Edward F.
