Whereas conventional methods of resolving ambiguities employ various curve fitting schemes in which the best differentiated range curve fit is compared with the Doppler derived velocity, the method described here uses the opposite approach, i.e., the Doppler derived velocity is integrated and compared with the range change over the integrating interval. The integrating approach offers the following advantages over conventional curve fitting. 1) There are no lag errors due to velocity changes, other than tracker lag induced by jerk. 2) No large storage of past data points and their weighting Constants must be implemented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "716", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "718", "date_publication": "Sept. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "716 - 718", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["John A.
