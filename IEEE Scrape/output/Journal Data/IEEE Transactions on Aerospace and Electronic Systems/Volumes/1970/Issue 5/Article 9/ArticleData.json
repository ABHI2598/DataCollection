Experimental data on simplified models obtained in 1966, but which heretofore have not received very wide dissemination, are reviewed and the results are compared with predictions based on a simplified (and semiempirical) theory for the end-on aspect case combined with a ray tracing procedure for other aspects. This theoretical method for estimation purposes is seen to provide quite adequate results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "672", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "674", "date_publication": "Sept. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "672 - 674", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["John W.
