Anomalies arising from airborne equipment, operating in the airborne environment, are described and analyzed. Factors contributing to overall system accuracy are treated with respect to VOR receiver response and to rate-limiting, filter means, with special attention to appropriate noise reduction systems providing zero or minimal time delay characteristics. The use of active filters in the VOR receiver is shown to be of major importance with regard to signal improvement and overall system accuracy. Active filters of the constant slew rate type have proved of significant value, both within the VOR receiver as well as in signal processing.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "692", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "696", "date_publication": "Sept. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "692 - 696", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Myron Anthony"], "keywords": ["Active filters", "Adaptive filters", "Aerospace electronics", "Delay effects", "FAA", "Filtering", "Navigation", "Noise reduction", "Signal processing", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "4103595"}
