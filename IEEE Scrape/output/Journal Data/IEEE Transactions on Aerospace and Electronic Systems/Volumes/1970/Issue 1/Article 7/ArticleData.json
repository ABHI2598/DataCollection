Over 972 MHz bandwidth, the sampled phase error relative to the reference was 7 degrees rms and 17 degrees peak, with a maximum Fourier component of 4 degrees. The FM pulse train is generated by a gated BWO driven by a stable linearizing waveform. Phase coherency during each pulse is obtained by a sampling technique, where the phase is corrected at intervals of 1/6 \u00c2\u00bfs, the RF phase having changed an integral number of cycles in each interval. Multiplication of the BWO signal by the sampling pulse train results in band-limited phase error pulses which are applied in a feedback loop. Pulse-to-pulse coherency is obtained by phase lock of the BWO starting frequency to the crystal reference. Feedback leveling holds the output constant to 0.3 dB. The basic MITRE technique was originally demonstrated at 10 MHz in 1964. Range results measured with the X-band model radar using the CLFM generator are given and confirm the phase errors of the CLFM.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "62", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "72", "date_publication": "Jan. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "62 - 72", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bruce D.
