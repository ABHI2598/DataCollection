The theoretical aspects of the design of such a waveform are presented with particular reference to frequency modulated, rectangular pulses. The design and performance of a matched-filter pulse-compression system having essentially zero mismatch loss are presented. The system discussed has a time-bandwidth product of 22 and time sidelobes suppressed at least 27 dB; the measured mismatch loss is 0.1 dB. The difficulty of achieving the required nonlinear time delay dispersion is overcome by synthesizing the dispersive network as a cascade of all-pass networks.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "73", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "78", "date_publication": "Jan. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "73 - 78", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Robert E.
