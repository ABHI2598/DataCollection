The analysis and experimental data presented here pertain to the signal processing gain when the antenna array is illuminated by a coherent signal source and a partially coherent noise source. For a noise source which is coherent, the processing gain depends on relative strength of the signal and noise, relative directions of arrival, and the usual \"array factor.\" The array exhibits capturing effects much as in an FM receiver. The effective antenna pattern is a superposition of two beams of different magnitudes, one directed to the signal source and the other to the noise source. When the noise is partially coherent, the behavior of the signal processor is quite complex. Analytical prediction and experimental simulation measurement on a four-channel system indicate that the partially coherent noise may be regarded as the source of an incoherent noise component plus a coherent noise component with the magnitude of the latter determined by the coherence coefficient for the noise source.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "79", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "87", "date_publication": "Jan. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "79 - 87", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Carson K.
