Compared to the manual method described in [1], this approach greatly reduces the astronaut's work load. Also, the computer can provide a more accurate solution, can present more flight plan options (allowing more tradeoffs between fuel usage and time), and can allow greater freedom in the sequencing of measurements and maneuvers. Physical characteristics, input-output parameters, and logic design of the computer are briefly described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Jan. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "22 - 28", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Alan M.
