His results are generalized here for random synchronization errors, and extended to PSK systems using decision directed channel measurements [2]. In both cases, it is shown that the effect of random synchronization errors is to reduce the effective input signal power and to introduce an additional self-noise. The effect is minimized when the synchronization error has zero mean and can easily be evaluated in terms of circuit parameters.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "98", "volume": "AES-6", "lastpage": "100", "date_publication": "Jan. 1970", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1970", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "98 - 100", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Gilbert A.
