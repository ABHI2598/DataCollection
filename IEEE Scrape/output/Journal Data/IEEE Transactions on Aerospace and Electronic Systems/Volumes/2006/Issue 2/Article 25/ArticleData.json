Previous findings that the method is suboptimal for reflectors leading to additional path lengths of less than about 7m are confirmed, and methods for combining this output with two other multipath indicators: time series of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and estimates of code multipath from dual frequency code and phase combinations, are investigated. A new method to combine all three indicators has been found and its application is shown to improve the quality of GPS static phase data by between 10% and 20% depending on the length of the additional path travelled by the reflected signal. The method can be applied completely automatically as it uses just the three multipath indicators; no knowledge of the surrounding environment is required. The paper concludes with some suggested practical applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "705", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "717", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982522", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "705 - 717", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
