Replacing the CF system with variable-frequency (VF) power improves overall efficiency, and reduce the system's weight and volume. However, this creates a new tier of requirements and design challenges. Novel VF-power architecture is developed with minimization of the power losses throughout the stages of power conversions. Optimal partitioning and grouping of onboard AC loads has been discussed with specific system data. New VF-input multi-functional power converters are also briefly discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "527", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "539", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982508", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "527 - 539", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jie Chang", "Anhua Wang"], "keywords": ["aircraft power systems", "power convertors", "AC loads", "VF-power system architecture", "aircraft power system", "constant-frequency supply", "power converters", "power losses", "variable-frequency power", "AC generators", "Aircraft", "Control systems", "Hybrid power systems", "Industrial power systems", "Power conversion", "Power generation", "Pulse width modulation converters", "Pulsed power supplies", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "1642569"}
