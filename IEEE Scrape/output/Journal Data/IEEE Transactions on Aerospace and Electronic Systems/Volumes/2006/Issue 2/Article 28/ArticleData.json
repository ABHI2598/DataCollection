In this article a simple and accurate PV model suitable for circuit-oriented simulator, PSIM, is developed. Necessary theory and mathematical treatment for the solar cell array model is discussed. To verify the model, i-v characteristics are generated through simulation for different solar insolations and compared with the experimentally obtained characteristics. The developed circuit models are integrated into the PV system and as an example a maximum power (MP) point tracking of PV system with dc-dc converter is considered here. Simulation and experimental result are in close agreement with each other. This verifies the accuracy and suitability of the developed circuit-oriented models.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "735", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "740", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982525", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "735 - 740", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["VeeracharyM"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "circuit simulation", "photovoltaic power systems", "solar cell arrays", "PSIM circuit-oriented simulator model", "PV system", "dc-dc converter", "maximum power point tracking", "nonlinear i-v characteristic", "nonlinear photovoltaic sources", "photovoltaic generator", "solar cell array model", "solar insolation", "Character generation", "Circuit simulation", "Costs", "DC-DC power converters", "Mathematical model", "Photovoltaic cells", "Photovoltaic systems", "Power generation", "Power system modeling", "Solar power generation", ""], "arnumber": "1642586"}
