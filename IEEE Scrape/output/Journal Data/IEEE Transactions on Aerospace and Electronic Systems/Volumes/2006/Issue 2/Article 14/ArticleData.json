Therefore, for an experimental aircraft used to test specific fault tolerant flight control systems, a safety logic scheme is needed to ensure a safe transition from conventional to research CLs (while at nominal conditions) as well as from research CLs at nominal conditions to conditions with \"simulated\" failures on specific control surfaces. This paper describes the design of such a safety scheme for the NASA Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS) F-15 Program. The goals of the IFCS F-15 program are to investigate the performance of a set of fault tolerant CLs based on the use of dynamic inversion with neural augmentation. The different transitions are monitored using information relative to flight conditions and controller-related performance criteria. The testing of the scheme is performed with a Simulink-based flight simulation code and interface developed at West Virginia University for the NASA IFCS F-15 aircraft.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "562", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "571", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982511", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "562 - 571", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
