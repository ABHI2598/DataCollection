Past research on the effects caused by power anomalies has been mostly focused on industrial, commercial, or residential systems, or on power distribution equipment. A literature survey reveals that there is no comprehensive review related to low-voltage (LV) power systems and utilization equipment applicable to military combat vehicles, such as aircraft and ships. This paper summarizes the results of a new literature survey that focused on the causes, effects, and mitigation methods for power anomalies typical of LV mobile power systems. Electric power anomaly cost data collected from the literature are also presented, from which the costs of anomalies to the national defense are estimated using some simple rationales.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "612", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "624", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982515", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "612 - 624", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
