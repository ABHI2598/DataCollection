Since GPS signals have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), they also have a low signal-to-jammer ratio so that the accuracy of location estimates is influenced by cochannel interference and intentional jammers. We propose a low-complexity blind adaptive receiver that is based on a novel modified despreader and the constant modulus (CM) array. This system is capable of ing directional interference and capturing the GPS signal of interest without requiring explicit angle-of-arrival (AOA) information. We also consider the multiple satellite problem and extend the proposed receiver to capture several GPS signals of interest. Representative computer simulation examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the multicomponent system for the suppression of different jammer types.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "503", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "513", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982506", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "503 - 513", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Suk-Seung Hwang", "J.
