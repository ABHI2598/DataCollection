For MT, a traditional method usually applies constant torque as an input, which tends to produce significant residual oscillation. Enhanced methods such as optimal control can somewhat reduce the residual oscillation, but may not be enough for minimum residual motion. Feedback linearization technique can drive the final nutation angle small enough, but it is rather sensitive to parameter uncertainty. The proposed method here takes advantage of nonlinear control approach with small steady-state nutation angle. Sensitivity about parameter uncertainties by feedback linearization can be reduced by the backstepping technique. Stability of the resulting control law is guaranteed by the Lyapunov stability theory. Boundedness of the control law is presented to validate practical merit of the proposed control law.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "453", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "463", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982502", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "453 - 463", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Baohua Lian", "Hyochoong Bang"], "keywords": ["Lyapunov methods", "aerospace control", "attitude control", "feedback", "linearisation techniques", "nonlinear control systems", "Lyapunov stability theory", "backstepping controller", "feedback linearization", "momentum transfer", "nonlinear control", "nutation angle", "optimal control", "parameter uncertainty", "residual motion", "residual oscillation", "spacecraft attitude control", "Attitude control", "Backstepping", "Feedback", "Linearization techniques", "Optimal control", "Space vehicles", "Stability", "Steady-state", "Torque", "Uncertain systems", ""], "arnumber": "1642563"}
