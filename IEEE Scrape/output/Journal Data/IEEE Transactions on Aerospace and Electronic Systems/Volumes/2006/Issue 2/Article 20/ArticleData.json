Therefore, the error in a vertical position estimate can be predicted if we know the clock bias estimation error. The latter can be estimated if the clock bias changes smoothly and, therefore, predictably. The current technology appears capable of manufacturing clocks which can meet this smoothness requirement for airborne use within the constraints of size, weight, and cost. We discuss the theoretical basis and present empirical data from laboratory and field experiments with a commercial rubidium standard to explore the benefits of integrity monitoring for precision approaches based on the receiver clock.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "636", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "643", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982517", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "636 - 643", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
