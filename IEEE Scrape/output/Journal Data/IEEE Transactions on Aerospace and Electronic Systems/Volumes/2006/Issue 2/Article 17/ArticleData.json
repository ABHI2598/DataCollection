The optimisation is driven by the requirement to minimise range/Doppler blindness whilst maintaining full decodability. In this paper we detail work in which the optimisation process is applied to design novel short medium PRF schedules requiring target data in just two PRFs. The paper reports on the testing of a variety of near-optimum schedules to compare their blindness, decoding, and ghosting performances. The results show that in many situations, the 2 of N schedules are a practical alternative to conventional 3 of N processing.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "601", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "611", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982514", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "601 - 611", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
