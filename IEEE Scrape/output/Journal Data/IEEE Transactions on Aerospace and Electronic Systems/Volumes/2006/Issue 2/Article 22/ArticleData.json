First, we derive an analytic uncertainty model from a parametric affine missile model developed by the authors. Based on this analytic model, an adaptive feedback linearizing control law accompanied by a sliding mode control law is proposed. We provide analyses of stability and output tracking performance of the overall adaptive missile system. The performance and validity of the proposed adaptive control scheme are demonstrated by simulation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "659", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "669", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982519", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "659 - 669", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jin Young Choi", "Dongkyoung Chwa"], "keywords": ["adaptive control", "control system synthesis", "missile control", "variable structure systems", "adaptive control", "adaptive feedback linearizing control law", "adaptive missile system", "analytic uncertainty model", "output tracking performance", "parametric affine missile model", "sliding mode control law", "stability", "tail-controlled skid-to-turn missiles", "Adaptive control", "Aerodynamics", "Control systems", "Linear feedback control systems", "Missiles", "Nonlinear control systems", "Programmable control", "Sliding mode control", "Uncertainty", "Vectors", ""], "arnumber": "1642580"}
