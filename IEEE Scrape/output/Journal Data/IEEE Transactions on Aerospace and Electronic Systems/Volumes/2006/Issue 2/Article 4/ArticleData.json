In this implementation, several formation-flying small satellites cooperate to perform multiple space missions. We investigate the possibility to produce high-resolution wide-area SAR images and fine ground moving-target indicator (GMTI) performance with constellation of small spaceborne SAR systems. In particular, we focus on the problems introduced by this particular SAR system, such as Doppler ambiguities, high sparseness of the satellite array, and array element errors. A space-time adaptive processing (STAP) approach combined with conventional SAR imaging algorithms is proposed which can solve these problems to some extent. The main idea of the approach is to use a STAP-based method to properly overcome the aliasing effect caused by the lower pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) and thereby retrieve the unambiguous azimuth wide (full) spectrum signals from the received echoes. Following this operation, conventional SAR data processing tools can be applied to focus the SAR images fully. The proposed approach can simultaneously achieve both high-resolution SAR mapping of wide ground scenes and GMTI with high efficiency. To obtain array element errors, an array auto-calibration technique is proposed to estimate them based on the angular and Doppler ambiguity analysis of the clutter echo. The optimizing of satellite formations is also analyzed, and a platform velocity/PRF criterion for array configurations is presented. An approach is given to make it possible that almost any given sparse array configuration can satisfy the criterion by slightly adjusting the PRF. Simulated results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "436", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "452", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982501", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "436 - 452", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Zhenfang Li", "Zheng Bao", "Hongyang Wang", "Guisheng Liao"], "keywords": ["Doppler effect", "array signal processing", "radar clutter", "radar imaging", "space-time adaptive processing", "spaceborne radar", "synthetic aperture radar", "Doppler ambiguities", "Doppler ambiguity analysis", "GMTI", "PRF", "SAR imaging", "STAP", "aliasing effect", "array auto-calibration", "array configurations", "array element errors", "clutter echo", "constellation SAR", "data processing", "formation-flying satellites", "ground moving-target indicator", "pulse-repetition frequency", "satellite array", "satellite formations", "signal processing techniques", "space missions", "space-time adaptive processing", "spaceborne synthetic aperture radar", "sparse array configuration", "Constellation diagram", "Frequency", "Radar polarimetry", "Radar signal processing", "Satellites", "Signal processing", "Signal processing algorithms", "Space missions", "Spaceborne radar", "Synthetic aperture radar", ""], "arnumber": "1642562"}
