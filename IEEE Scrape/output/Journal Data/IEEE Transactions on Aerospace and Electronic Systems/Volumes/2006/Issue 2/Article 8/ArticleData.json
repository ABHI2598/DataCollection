Although the very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is handled by the large spreading gain, GPS is susceptible to high-power interference signals and various types of jammers. We propose multicomponent receiver architectures for GPS interference suppression. A conventional antenna system is first considered which utilizes a minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) beam former and assumes that the GPS signal angle of arrival (AOA) and the antenna model are known at the receiver. However, this receiver is sensitive to AOA estimation errors and can have a high computational complexity. This sensitivity problem is eliminated by a multicomponent system based on a multistage matched filter (MF). Since this MF receiver also has a high computational complexity because the jammer AOAs must be estimated, we introduce a blind interference canceler based on the constant modulus (CM) array that is insensitive to AOA estimation errors and has a low computational complexity. Computer simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of the various systems for interference suppression in example signal scenarios.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "489", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "502", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982505", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "489 - 502", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Suk-Seung Hwang", "J.
