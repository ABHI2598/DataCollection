These signals are potentially harmful to users of the spectrum under assessment This paper presents a method of high resolution channel sounding causing only low levels of wideband interference and details a measurement system developed to characterise the band currently used for global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), where high levels of probing signal would have safety of life implications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "514", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "526", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982507", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "514 - 526", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["E.
