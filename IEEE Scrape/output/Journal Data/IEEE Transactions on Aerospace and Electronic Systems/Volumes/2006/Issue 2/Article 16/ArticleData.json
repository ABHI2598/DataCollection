However, it is not always possible to deploy the nodes precisely, so a calibration phase is needed to estimate the position and the orientation of each node before doing any tracking or localization. An acoustic node can be calibrated from sources of opportunity such as beacons or a moving source. We derive and compare several calibration methods for the case where the node can hear a moving source whose position can be reported back to the node. Since calibration from a moving source is, in effect, the dual of a tracking problem; methods derived for acoustic target trackers are used to obtain robust and high resolution acoustic calibration processes. For example, two direction-of-arrival-based calibration methods can be formulated based on combining angle estimates, geometry, and the motion dynamics of the moving source. In addition, a maximum likelihood (ML) solution is presented using a narrowband acoustic observation model, along with a Newton-based search algorithm that speeds up the calculation the likelihood surface. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the node position estimates is also derived to show that the effect of position errors for the moving source on the estimated node position is much less severe than the variance in angle estimates from the microphone array. The performance of the calibration algorithms is demonstrated on synthetic and field data.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "585", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "600", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8982513", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "585 - 600", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["V.
