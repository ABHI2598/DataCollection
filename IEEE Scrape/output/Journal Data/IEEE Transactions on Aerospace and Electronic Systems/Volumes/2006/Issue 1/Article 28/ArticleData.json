The subject of determining the optimum number of antenna faces has been addressed previously by several authors (Knittel,1965) using various figures of merit. For active phased array radars performing tracking and discrimination functions, the important figure of merit for antenna performance is power-aperture-gain (PAG) product. We determine the optimal number of faces by choosing PAG product as the figure of merit for the same tracking and discrimination performance at maximum scan angles. Given equal antenna performance at maximum scan angles in the coverage area, cost is the primary basis for comparison in the selection of the number of faces for a modern active phased array radar system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "351", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "360", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8830105", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "351 - 360", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
