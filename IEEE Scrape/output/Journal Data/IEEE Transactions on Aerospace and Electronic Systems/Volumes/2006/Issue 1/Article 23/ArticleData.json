Closely spaced targets can produce unresolved measurements when they occupy the same range cell of the radar. These issues are the salient features of the benchmark problem for tracking unresolved targets combined with radar management, for which this paper presents the only complete solution to date. In this paper a modified version of a recently developed maximum likelihood (ML) angle estimator, which can produce two measurements from a single (unresolved) detection, is presented. A modified generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is also described to detect the presence of two unresolved targets. Sea-surface-induced multipath can produce a severe bias in the elevation angle measurement when the conventional monopulse ratio angle extractor method is used. A modified version of a recently developed ML angle extractor, which produces nearly unbiased elevation angle measurements and significantly improves the track accuracy, is presented. Efficient radar resource allocation algorithms for two closely spaced targets and targets flying close to the sea surface are also presented. Finally, the IMMPDAF (interacting multiple model estimator with probabilistic data association filter modules) is used to track these targets. It is found that a two-model IMMPDAF performs better than the three-model version used in the previous benchmark. Also, the IMMPDAF with a coordinated turn model works better than the one using a Wiener process acceleration model. The signal processing and tracking algorithms presented here, operating in a feedback manner, form a comprehensive solution to the most realistic tracking and radar management problem to date.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "279", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "300", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8830100", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "279 - 300", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
