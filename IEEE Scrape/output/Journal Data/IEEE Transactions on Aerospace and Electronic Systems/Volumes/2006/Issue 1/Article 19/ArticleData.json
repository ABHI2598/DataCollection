A PACF is perfect when all its out-of-phase autocorrelation values are identically equal to zero. This paper investigates periodic, two-valued, frequency-coded signals. While none could be found with perfect PACF, we present examples with nearly perfect PACF. Their relationship to binary phase-coded signals is also considered. These signals should be attractive for CW radars because of their simple implementation, clean spectrum, and the favorable range response of their matched receiver.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "237", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "248", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8830096", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "237 - 248", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["N.
