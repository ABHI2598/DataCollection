A great deal of interest has recently been shown in defining clutter for electro-optical images. In spite of so many definitions available, no single clutter definition has been agreed on by the electro-optical community as being the best. We modify the structure similarity index, which is extensively used for image quality assessment, to be clutter metrics and call them target structure similarity measures (TSSIMs). Two different methods for calculating the TSSIM metrics are suggested. The TSSIMs of many images in Search_2 dataset have been analyzed. Experimental results show the proposed metrics correlate very well to the detection probability of the observers.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "361", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "368", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8830106", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "361 - 368", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Honghua Chang", "Jianqi Zhang"], "keywords": ["clutter", "image recognition", "object detection", "clutter metrics", "detection probability", "electro-optical images", "human target acquisition", "image quality assessment", "structure similarity index", "target structure similarity measures", "Anthropometry", "Computational complexity", "Data analysis", "Data mining", "Distortion measurement", "Humans", "Image analysis", "Image quality", "Visual system", ""], "arnumber": "1603429"}
