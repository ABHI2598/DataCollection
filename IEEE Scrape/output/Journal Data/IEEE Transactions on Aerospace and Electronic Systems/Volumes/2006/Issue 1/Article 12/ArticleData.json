The additional uncertainties induced by signal itself and the statistical complexity of the received signals result in major challenges. The statistical properties of the random-noise interferometer and monopulse radar system are studied and compared theoretically using an approximation method. Furthermore, a random-noise coherent correlation receiver (CCR) architecture is proposed. The concept of mean monopulse characteristic curve (MMCC) is introduced. Experimental results using an X-band random-noise monopulse radar system validate the theoretical predictions of random-noise monopulse characteristics and suggest potential applications such as surveillance, imaging, and maneuvering target tracking.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "160", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "173", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8830089", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "160 - 173", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yan Zhang", "R.
