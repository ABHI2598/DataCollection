The new algorithm evaluates the state matrix estimate and the estimation error covariance matrix in terms of the original system matrices. The proposed algorithm naturally fits systems which are most conveniently described by matrix process and measurement equations. Its formulation uses a compact notation for aiding both intuition and mathematical manipulation. It is a straightforward extension of the classical KF, and includes as special cases other matrix filters that were developed in the past. Beyond the analytical value of the matrix filter, it is shown through various examples arising in engineering problems that this filter can be computationally more efficient than its vectorized version.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "147", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "159", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8830088", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "147 - 159", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
