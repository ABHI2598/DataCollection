The SRD is constructed as a subsystem model for the aircraft electrical system model library. The purpose is to build a generic, expandable, and relatively complete airborne model library, then conveniently assemble a system-level model of airborne power system to simulate its dynamic performance, and then alleviate the difficulty in design and optimization of airborne power system during the conceptual design phase.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "220", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "227", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8830094", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "220 - 227", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Qiong-Zhong Chen", "Yu-Feng Mo", "Guang Meng"], "keywords": ["aircraft power systems", "electric machine analysis computing", "object-oriented programming", "reluctance motor drives", "Dymola object-oriented modeling software", "airborne power system model library", "aircraft electrical system model library", "rapid-calculation nonlinear model", "switched reluctance drive system", "Aerodynamics", "Aircraft manufacture", "Mathematical model", "Object oriented modeling", "Power system analysis computing", "Power system dynamics", "Power system modeling", "Power system simulation", "Reluctance machines", "Reluctance motors", ""], "arnumber": "1603417"}
