The algorithm corrects for the shifts in target positions due to ambiguities in the wall thickness and dielectric constant. We consider uniform walls and perform imaging using wideband beamforming, with the antennas placed against the wall. Behind-the-wall images are obtained using different structures of transmit and receive arrays. For each array structure, a trajectory of the shifts in the target locations is generated assuming different wall parameters. The target position is estimated as the intersection of the corresponding trajectories. The paper shows that for unknown wall thickness or dielectric constant, the point of intersection is the true target position. In the case when both parameters are unknown, the estimated target location is in close proximity to the target true position. It is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed technique is rather insensitive to the target location behind the wall and to various array structures.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "301", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "315", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8830101", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "301 - 315", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
