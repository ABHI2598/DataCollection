We assume that the former belongs to a known linear subspace, up to a fraction of its energy. When the subspace of interest consists of the presumed steering vector, this amounts to assuming that the angle between the actual steering vector and the presumed steering vector is upper bounded. Within this framework, we derive the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). We show that it involves solving a minimization problem with the constraint that the signal of interest lies inside a cone. We present a computationally efficient algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) based on the Lagrange multiplier technique. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance and the robustness of this new detector, and compare it with the adaptive coherence estimator which assumes that the steering vector lies entirely in a subspace", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1131", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1139", "date_publication": "July 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9204146", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "3", "pages": "1131 - 1139", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Olivier Besson"], "keywords": ["covariance matrices", "maximum likelihood estimation", "signal detection", "Lagrange multiplier", "adaptive coherence estimator", "bounded mismatch", "covariance matrix", "generalized likelihood ratio test", "linear subspace", "maximum likelihood estimator", "signal detection", "steering vector", "Background noise", "Covariance matrix", "Lagrangian functions", "Maximum likelihood detection", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Numerical simulation", "Robustness", "Signal detection", "Testing", "Vectors", ""], "arnumber": "4014428"}
