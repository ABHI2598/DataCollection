Precisely, a proportional derivative (PD)-like state feedback control law is employed together with a suitable adaptation mechanism for the controller gain. Simulation results are presented, which illustrate the performance of the proposed control law", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "796", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "805", "date_publication": "July 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9204123", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "3", "pages": "796 - 805", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Marco Lovera", "Alessandro Astolfi"], "keywords": ["attitude control", "closed loop systems", "electromagnetic actuators", "space vehicles", "state feedback", "Earth pointing attitude control", "adaptation mechanism", "closed loop stability", "global magnetic attitude control", "gravity gradient", "magnetic actuators", "proportional derivative", "relative attitude equilibrium", "spacecraft", "state feedback control law", "Actuators", "Attitude control", "Coils", "Gravity", "Optimal control", "PD control", "Proportional control", "Space vehicles", "Stability", "State feedback", ""], "arnumber": "4014448"}
