The effect of the rotation of the Earth around its own axis also adds an additional component to this Doppler frequency. The overall effect of the rotation of the Earth on the Doppler turns out to be two correction factors in terms of a crab angle affecting the azimuth angle, and a crab magnitude scaling the Doppler magnitude of the clutter patch. Interestingly, both these quantities depend only on the SBR orbit inclination and its latitude and not on the location of the clutter patch of interest. Further, the crab angle has maximum effect for an SBR on a polar orbit that is above the equator. The crab magnitude, on the other hand, peaks for an SBR on an equatorial orbit. Together with the range foldover phenomenon, their overall effect is to generate Doppler spread/splitting resulting in wider clutter notches that degrade the clutter nulling performance of adaptive processing techniques. A detailed performance analysis and methods to minimize these effects are discussed here", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "917", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "932", "date_publication": "July 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9204132", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "3", "pages": "917 - 932", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Sunnikrishna Pillai", "Braham Himed", "Ke Yong Li"], "keywords": ["Doppler radar", "Earth rotation", "spaceborne radar", "Doppler frequency component", "Earth rotation effect", "adaptive processing", "azimuth angle", "clutter nulling performance", "crab magnitude scaling", "range foldover", "space based radar performance", "Azimuth", "Doppler radar", "Earth", "Frequency", "Geometry", "Object detection", "Radar clutter", "Space technology", "Spaceborne radar", "Surveillance", ""], "arnumber": "4014461"}
