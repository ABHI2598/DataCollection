This paper describes the two compression algorithms and demonstrates their near lossless feature. The compression error introduced by the two compression algorithms was compared with the intrinsic noise of the original data that is caused by the instrument noise and other noise sources such as calibration and atmospheric correction errors. The experimental results showed that the compression error was not larger than the intrinsic noise of the original data when a test data set was compressed at a compression ratio of 20:1. The overall noise in the reconstructed data that contains both the intrinsic noise and the compression error is even smaller than the intrinsic noise when the data is compressed using SAMVQ. A multi-disciplinary user acceptability study has been carried out in order to evaluate the impact of the two compression algorithms on hyperspectral data applications. This paper briefly summarizes the evaluation results of the user acceptability study. A prototype hardware compressor that implements the two compression algorithms has been built using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and benchmarked. The compression ratio and fidelity achieved by the hardware compressor are similar to those obtained by software simulation", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "851", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "866", "date_publication": "July 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9204127", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "3", "pages": "851 - 866", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Shen-en Qian", "Martin Bergeron", "Ian Cunningham", "Luc Gagnon", "Allan Hollinger"], "keywords": ["compressors", "field programmable gate arrays", "geophysical signal processing", "image coding", "remote sensing", "vector quantisation", "HSOCVQ", "SAMVQ", "compression error", "field programmable gate arrays", "hierarchical self organizing cluster vector quantization", "hyperspectral data applications", "hyperspectral satellite", "instrument noise", "intrinsic noise", "near lossless data compression", "prototype hardware compressor", "successive approximation multi-stage vector quantization", "Approximation algorithms", "Compression algorithms", "Data compression", "Error correction", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Hardware", "Hyperspectral imaging", "Hyperspectral sensors", "Satellites", "Vector quantization", ""], "arnumber": "4014456"}
