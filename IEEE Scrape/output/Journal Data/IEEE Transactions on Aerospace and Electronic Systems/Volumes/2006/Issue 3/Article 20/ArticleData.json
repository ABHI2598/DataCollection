The enhanced FRACTA (FRACTA.E) algorithm with KACE as well as Doppler-sensitive adaptive coherence estimation (DS-ACE) is applied to the KASSPER I & II data sets where it is shown via simulation that near-clairvoyant detection performance is maintained with as little as 1/3 of the normally required number of training data samples. The KASSPER I & II data sets are simulated high-fidelity heterogeneous clutter scenarios which possess several groups of dense targets. KACE provides a priori information about the clutter covariance matrix by exploiting approximately known operating parameters about the radar platform such as pulse repetition frequency (PRF), crab angle, and platform velocity. In addition, the DS-ACE detector is presented which provides greater robustness for low sample support by mitigating false alarms from undernulled clutter near the clutter ridge while maintaining sufficient sensitivity away from the clutter ridge to enable effective target detection performance", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1043", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1057", "date_publication": "July 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9204140", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "3", "pages": "1043 - 1057", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Shannon D.
