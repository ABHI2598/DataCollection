First, we discuss the tracking performance improvement with bias estimation and compensation for synchronous biased sensors, and then a novel bias estimation method is proposed for asynchronous sensors with time-varying biases. The performance analysis and simulations show that asynchronous sensors have a slightly degraded performance compared with the \"equivalent\" synchronous ones. The bias estimates as well as the corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the covariance of the bias estimates, i.e., the quantification of the available information on the sensor biases in any scenario are also given. Tracking performance evaluations with different sources of biases-offset biases, scale biases, and sensor location uncertainties, are also presented and we show that tracking performance is significantly improved with bias estimation and compensation compared with the target tracking using the original biased measurements. The performance is also close to the lower bound obtained in the absence of biases", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1139", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1149", "date_publication": "July 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9204147", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "3", "pages": "1139 - 1149", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Xiangdon Lin", "Yaakov Bar-Shalom"], "keywords": ["error compensation", "estimation theory", "sensor fusion", "target tracking", "time-varying systems", "Cramer-Rao lower bound", "asynchronous sensors", "bias compensation", "bias estimation", "moving targets", "multisensor target tracking", "time-varying biases", "Analytical models", "Degradation", "Equations", "Error compensation", "Error correction", "Filters", "Performance analysis", "Sensor systems", "State estimation", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "4014446"}
