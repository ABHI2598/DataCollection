These systems can be made phase coherent using the technique of heterodyne correlation. Phase coherence has been exploited to measure Doppler and thereby the velocity of moving targets. The Doppler visibility, i.e., the ability to extract Doppler information over the inherent clutter spectra, is constrained by system parameters, especially the phase noise generated by microwave components. Our paper proposes a new phase noise model for the heterodyne mixer as applicable for ultrawideband (UWB) random noise radar and for the local oscillator in the time domain. The Doppler spectra are simulated by including phase noise contamination effects and compared with our previous experimental results. A genetic algorithm (GA) optimization routine is applied to synthesize the effects of a variety of parameter combinations to derive a suitable empirical formula for estimating the Doppler visibility in dB. According to the phase noise analysis and the simulation results, the Doppler visibility of UWB random noise radar depends primarily on the following parameters: 1) the local oscillator (LO) drive level of the receiver heterodyne mixer, 2) the saturation current in the receiver heterodyne mixer, 3) the bandwidth of the transmit noise source, and 4) the target velocity. Other parameters such as the carrier frequency of the receiver LO and the loaded quality factor of the LO have a small effect over the range of applicability of the model and are therefore neglected in the model formulation. The Doppler visibility curves generated from this formula match the simulation results very well over the applicable parameter range within 1 dB. Our model may therefore be used to quickly estimate the Doppler visibility of random UWB noise radars for trade-off analysis", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "904", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "916", "date_publication": "July 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9204131", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "3", "pages": "904 - 916", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Zhixi Li", "Ram M.
