To this end, resorting to the generalized likelihood function (GLF) criterion (both one-step and two-step), we design and assess data-adaptive procedures for the selection of training data. Then we introduce a KA radar detector composed of three elements: a geographic-map-based data selector, which exploits some a priori information concerning the topography of the observed scene, a data-adaptive training selector which removes dynamic outliers from the training data, and an adaptive radar detector which performs the final decision about the target presence. The performance of the KA algorithm is analyzed both on simulated as well as on real radar data collected by the McMaster University IPIX radar. The results show that the new KA system achieves a satisfactory performance level and can outperform some previously proposed adaptive detection schemes", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1058", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1079", "date_publication": "July 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9204141", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "3", "pages": "1058 - 1079", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["E.
