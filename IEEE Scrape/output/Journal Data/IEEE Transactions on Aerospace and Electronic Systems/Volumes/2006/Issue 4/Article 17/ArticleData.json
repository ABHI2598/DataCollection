A case is made here for maintaining rudimentary nuclear, laser, and high-power microwave (HPM) hardening requirements in order to protect against developing third world threats. The third world nuclear threat is well known. Less appreciated is the fact that third world laser and microwave threats have changed radically in the past few years", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1437", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1445", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335873", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1437 - 1445", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["John R.
