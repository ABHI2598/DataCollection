Verification ensures that the controlled system will behave as expected under any circumstances it may operate. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new method for the verification of aircraft control systems. The focus of this method is on aircraft systems that are characterized as hybrid, i.e., that merge continuous and discrete dynamics. The method proposed is divided into two main parts: the system modeling and the verification of behavioral properties. In the first part, Petri net, differential equation systems, and object oriented concepts are used concurrently in order to model complex hybrid systems. In the second part, the distributed nature of the model is explored in order to decompose a complex verification problem into series of simple local problems. Linear logic is used as a basis of a theorem-proving approach for the verification from the discrete-event point of view. The verification method has been applied to a number of case studies. Among them is the landing system of a military aircraft, which is described in this paper", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1420", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1436", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335872", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1420 - 1436", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Emilia Villani", "Robert Valette", "PAULO EIGI MIYAGI"], "keywords": ["Petri nets", "aerospace safety", "aircraft landing guidance", "program verification", "Petri nets", "aircraft control system", "complex verification", "continuous dynamics", "differential equation systems", "discrete dynamics", "hybrid approach", "landing system verification", "linear logic", "military aircraft", "object oriented concepts", "program verification", "theorem-proving", "Aerodynamics", "Aerospace safety", "Control system synthesis", "Control systems", "Differential equations", "Gears", "Logic", "Military aircraft", "Object oriented modeling", "Petri nets", ""], "arnumber": "4108002"}
