The exploitation of nonstandard background information such as road maps and terrain information is therefore highly desirable for the enhancement of track quality and track continuity. The present paper presents a Bayesian approach to incorporate such information consistently. It is particularly suited to deal with winding roads and networks of roads. The target dynamics is modeled in quasi one-dimensional road coordinates and mapped onto ground coordinates using linear road segments taking road map errors into account. The case of several intersecting roads with different characteristics, such as mean curvature, slope, or visibility, is treated within an interacting multiple model (IMM) scheme. Targets can be masked both by the clutter notch of the sensor and by terrain obstacles. Both effects are modeled using a sensor-target state dependent detection probability. The iterative filter equations are formulated within a framework of Gaussian sum approximations on the one hand and a particle filter approach on the other hand. Simulation results for single targets taken from a realistic ground scenario show strongly reduced target location errors compared with the case of neglecting road-map information. By modeling the clutter notch of the GMTI sensor, early detection of stopping targets is demonstrated", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1264", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1274", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335861", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1264 - 1274", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Martin Ulmke", "Wolfgang Koch"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "iterative methods", "target tracking", "Bayesian approach", "Gaussian sum approximations", "clutter notch", "ground moving target tracking", "interacting multiple model", "iterative filter equations", "road map", "sensor target", "state dependent detection probability", "target dynamics", "terrain obstacles", "Aerodynamics", "Clutter", "Density measurement", "Particle filters", "Radar tracking", "Roads", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Surveillance", "Target tracking", "Vehicle dynamics", ""], "arnumber": "4108001"}
