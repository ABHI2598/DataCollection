It can cover rigid parts of a target and degrade the inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) image. Separation of the patterns caused by stationary parts of the target from those caused by moving (rotating or vibrating) parts is the topic of this paper. Two techniques for separation of the rigid part from the rotating parts have been proposed. The first technique is based on time-frequency (TF) representation with sliding window and order statistics techniques. The first step in this technique is recognition of rigid parts in the range/cross-range plane. In the second step, reviewed TF representation and order statistics setup are employed to obtain signals caused by moving parts. The second technique can be applied in the case of very emphatic m-D effect. In the first step the rotating parts are recognized, based on the inverse Radon transform (RT). After masking these patterns, a radar image with the rigid body reflection can be obtained. The proposed methods are illustrated by examples", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1496", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1506", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335880", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1496 - 1506", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ljubisa Stankovic", "Igor Djurovic", "Thayananthan Thayaparan"], "keywords": ["Doppler effect", "Radon transforms", "radar imaging", "synthetic aperture radar", "ISAR imaging", "inverse Radon transform", "inverse synthetic aperture radar image", "microDoppler effect", "order statistics", "radar target", "rigid body reflection", "sliding window", "target rigid body", "time-frequency representation", "Chirp", "Degradation", "Inverse synthetic aperture radar", "Performance analysis", "Radar antennas", "Radar imaging", "Reflection", "Statistics", "Time frequency analysis", "Wavelet analysis", ""], "arnumber": "4108000"}
