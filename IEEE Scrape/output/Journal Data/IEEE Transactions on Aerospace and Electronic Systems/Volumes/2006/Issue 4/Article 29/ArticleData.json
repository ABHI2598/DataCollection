To significantly reduce the prohibitive computational complexity to deal with high order PPSs, effective decomposition of the overall computational task is important for any practical applications. This paper derives a radix-2 decimation-in-frequency (DIF) fast algorithms for any order of the PPSs by using the periodic and symmetric properties of the PTFT. Compared with other reported fast algorithms, the proposed one is simple in concept and achieves a significant reduction of the required computational complexity", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1540", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1546", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335885", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1540 - 1546", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Guoan Bi", "Yongmei Wei", "Gang Li", "Chunru Wan"], "keywords": ["array signal processing", "computational complexity", "polynomials", "time-frequency analysis", "transforms", "1D polynomial-phase signal", "computational complexity", "frequency domain", "multidimensional output array", "periodic properties", "phase coefficients", "polynomial time-frequency transforms", "radix-2 DIF fast algorithms", "radix-2 decimation-in-frequency fast algorithms", "symmetric properties", "Computational complexity", "Frequency domain analysis", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Phase estimation", "Phased arrays", "Polynomials", "Pulse compression methods", "Radar applications", "Synthetic aperture radar", "Time frequency analysis", ""], "arnumber": "4107979"}
