A general relationship between the asymmetric channel ratio and the optimal ACK frequency to achieve maximum throughput is not available. This paper studies the optimal ACK frequency with respect to the channel RTT to achieve the maximum throughput over various asymmetric, geo-stationary earth orbit (GEO)-satellite links using a test-bed. It is found that when the asymmetric channel ratio is as high as about 100/1, the optimal ACK frequency must be increased with an increase in asymmetric ratio to complement the impact of the reduction of ACK channel rate. As a rule of thumb, every two-fold increase in asymmetric ratio requires the optimal ACK frequency to be increased by one ACK per RTT. A regression model was built to reflect the relationship between the optimal ACK frequency and the asymmetric channel ratio and has been validated", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1311", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1322", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335864", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1311 - 1322", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ruhai Wang", "Stephen Horan", "Bingxin Tian", "Sreelakshmi Bonasu"], "keywords": ["Internet", "satellite communication", "transport protocols", "TCP", "acknowledgement strategy", "asymmetric channel ratio", "asymmetric links", "asymmetric space-Internet links", "geo-stationary earth orbit satellite", "optimal acknowledgment frequency", "regression model", "round-trip time", "space communications", "transmission control protocol", "Bandwidth", "Communication system control", "Delay effects", "Frequency", "Internet", "Space missions", "Space vehicles", "TCPIP", "Throughput", "Transport protocols", ""], "arnumber": "4108003"}
