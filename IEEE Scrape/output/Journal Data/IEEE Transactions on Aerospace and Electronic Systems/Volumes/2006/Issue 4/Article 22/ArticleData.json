Typically these thrusters are subject to switching constraints. A limit cycle is the normal steady state operation mode of such attitude control systems. This contribution deals with controller design for precision attitude stabilization using actuators whose switching restrictions are explicitly considered. An exact approach is presented using ideas from established relay control methods. The design procedure is illustrated with an attitude controller design to attain a limit cycle with prescribed characteristics", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1485", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1492", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335878", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1485 - 1492", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Karl Heinz Kienitz"], "keywords": ["actuators", "attitude control", "relay control", "actuators", "attitude control systems", "precision attitude stabilization", "relay control methods", "steady state operation", "switching restrictions", "Actuators", "Attitude control", "Control systems", "Design methodology", "Limit-cycles", "Propellants", "Relays", "Space vehicles", "State-space methods", "Steady-state", ""], "arnumber": "4107990"}
