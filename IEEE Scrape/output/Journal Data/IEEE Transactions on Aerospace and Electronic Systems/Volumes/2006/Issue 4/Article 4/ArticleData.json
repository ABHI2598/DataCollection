Throughout this manuscript, it is assumed that the target motion is conditionally deterministic, which leads us to focus on batch algorithms. Another common assumption is poor observability, which results from another constraint: (very) limited amplitude of the observer maneuvers. Classical batch algorithms are based on iterative methods (such as gradient techniques), but they perform very poorly in this context and including constraints is not easy and not reliable in this way. Instead, we consider simulation-based methods, i.e., Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) sampling, developed in a Bayesian context. In this way, it is possible to take into account any type of constraint, and to drastically improve estimation of weakly observable parameters. As a by-product, an estimate of confidence intervals is obtained. This is the aim of the highest probability density (HPD) intervals. This study is illustrated by simulation results, while the benefits of constraint inclusion are analyzed via geometric methods", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1240", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1263", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335860", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1240 - 1263", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Frederic Bavencoff", "Jean-michel Vanpeperstraete", "J. -pierre Le Cadre"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "Markov processes", "Monte Carlo methods", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "iterative methods", "target tracking", "Bayesian context", "Markov chain Monte Carlo methods", "bearings only observations", "constrained bearings only", "iterative methods", "probability density intervals", "target motion analysis", "target trajectories", "Bayesian methods", "Context modeling", "Iterative algorithms", "Iterative methods", "Monte Carlo methods", "Motion analysis", "Observability", "Sampling methods", "Solid modeling", "Trajectory", ""], "arnumber": "4107977"}
