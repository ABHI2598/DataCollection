The basis of this technique is to use the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) to quantify and control the optimal achievable accuracy of target state estimation. In the original formulation (Hernandez, et. al. 2004) it was assumed that the sensor locations were known without error. In the current paper, the authors extend this framework by addressing the issues of imperfect sensor placement and uncertain sensor movement (e.g., sensor drift). The crucial consideration is then how these two forms of uncertainty are factored into the sensor management strategy. If unaccounted for, these uncertainties will render the output of the resource manager inaccurate and overoptimistic. The authors adjust the PCRLB to account for sensor location uncertainty, and we also allow for measurement origin uncertainty due to missed detections and false alarms. The work is motivated by the problem of tracking a submarine by adaptively deploying sonobuoys from a helicopter. Simulation results are presented to show the advantages of accounting for sensor location uncertainty within this focal domain of antisubmarine warfare. The authors note that the generic nature of the technique allows it to be utilized within other problem domains, including tracking ground-based targets using unattended ground sensors (UGSs) or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1474", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1485", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335877", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1474 - 1485", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["K.
