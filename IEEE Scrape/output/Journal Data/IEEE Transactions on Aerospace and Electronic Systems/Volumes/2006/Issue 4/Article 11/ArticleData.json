Based on sequential track correlation algorithm, the restricted and attenuation memory track correlation algorithms and sequential classic assignment rules are proposed. In this paper, these algorithms are described in detail. Then, the track correlation mass and multivalency processing methods are discussed as well. Finally, simulations are designed to compare the correlation performance of these algorithms with that of Singer's and Bar-Shalom's algorithms. The simulation results show that the performance of these algorithms proposed here is much better than that of the classical methods under the environments of dense targets, interfering, noise, track cross, and so on. Under the above situations, their correct correlation ratio is improved about 69 percent over the classical methods", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1359", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1371", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335867", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1359 - 1371", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["He You", "Zhang Jingwei"], "keywords": ["correlation methods", "distributed sensors", "sensor fusion", "Bar-Shalom algorithm", "Singer algorithm", "attenuation memory", "distributed multisensor", "multisensor data fusion system", "multivalency processing", "restricted memory", "sequential track correlation", "track-to-track association", "Aerospace engineering", "Attenuation", "Covariance matrix", "Gaussian noise", "Multisensor systems", "Noise measurement", "Target tracking", "Testing", "Time measurement", "Working environment noise", ""], "arnumber": "4108006"}
