Such a solution did not exist previously in the literature. For aerospace and military applications, the solution is precise. For civilian cellular phone applications, however, the solution is susceptible to unrelated errors from the phenomenon of multipath delays in the channels. This phenomenon is factored in mathematically in the solution and a simulation that characterizes its error bounds is presented", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1396", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1404", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335870", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1396 - 1404", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ezzat G.
