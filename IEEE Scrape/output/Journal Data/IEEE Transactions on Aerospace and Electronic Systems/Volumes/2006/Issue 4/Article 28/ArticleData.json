The key point to the successful use of this model is to determine the turn rate parameter. A new method to estimate the turn rate by using radar range-rate measurements is presented. First, four possible turn rates can be achieved with the range-rate measurements. Second, the minimum turn rate and its opposite value are chosen to be the possible turn rates. Finally, an interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm with one constant velocity (CV) model and two CT models is designed to track the maneuvering target which performs uniform and ct motions. Monte-Carlo simulation results show that this algorithm is not only better than equivalent noise approach in tracking performance, but also better than the conventional IMM algorithm with the adaptive turn rate model. Further simulations show that the algorithm is robust with the accuracy of the range-rate measurements", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1532", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1541", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335884", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1532 - 1541", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Xianghui Yuan", "Chongzhao Han", "Zhansheng Duan", "Ming Lei"], "keywords": ["Monte Carlo methods", "distance measurement", "estimation theory", "radar tracking", "target tracking", "Monte-Carlo simulation", "adaptive turn rate estimation", "constant velocity model", "coordinated turn model", "coordinated turn motion", "interacting multiple model", "maneuvering target tracking", "radar range rate measurements", "Acceleration", "Filters", "Motion detection", "Motion measurement", "Noise level", "Performance evaluation", "Radar tracking", "Recursive estimation", "State estimation", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "4108007"}
