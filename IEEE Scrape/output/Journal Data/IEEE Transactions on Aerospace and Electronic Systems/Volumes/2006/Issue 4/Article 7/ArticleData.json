The clutter is modelled by pseudo targets moving with Bragg velocity towards and away from the radar. The design is based on the Wigner distribution (WD) defined by Chan (type-III WD, in our terminology) rather than the WD defined by Claasen and Mecklenbrauker (1980) (2times type-I WD, in our terminology). Like the type-I WD, the type-III WD also concentrates a chirp signal onto a straight line in the TF plane. The type-III WD has the following advantages: 1) Its range of unambiguously measurable frequencies (RUMF) is [-pi,pi] rad/s, whereas for the type-I WD the RUMF is [-pi/2,pi/2] rad/s. 2) It allows a target separated from the clutter by pi rad/s to be detected, whereas the type-I WD coalesces such a target with the clutter and thereby mask it. An ambiguity function (AF) was defined corresponding to the type-III WD and use it to derive a smoothed type-III WD that mitigates the clutter. The smoothed type-III WD method is applied to real radar data and shown to be superior to the conventional Fourier transform method. The advantages of the type-III WD over the type-I WD are also demonstrated. The design principles laid out in the paper can also be used to develop a TF method for use in air traffic control radar (ATCR) for detecting an accelerating target in land clutter", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1289", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1310", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335863", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1289 - 1310", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
