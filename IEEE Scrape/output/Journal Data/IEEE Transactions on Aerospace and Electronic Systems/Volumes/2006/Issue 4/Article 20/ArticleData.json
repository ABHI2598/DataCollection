This approach is based on the cascading of the augmented-state approximate conditional mean (ASACM) filter and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) filter. An ASACM filter for single interference suppression in spread-spectrum systems has been reported in the recent literature. However, the formulation of the ASACM filter and its performance analysis is lacking in the case of suppression of multiple FM interferences. The ASACM filter is formulated here for the suppression of multiple FM jammers. Further, a DWT filter using biorthogonal wavelet is suggested for the suppression of FM jammers. Finally, these two filters are cascaded to get an optimum performance for higher jammer to signal ratio, which is of importance in the GPS, for the case of suppression of multiple FM jammers. The performance of the proposed filters is analyzed through simulation examples for the suppression of single and multiple FM jammers in GPS receivers", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1464", "volume": "42", "lastpage": "1474", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9335876", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "1464 - 1474", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["K.
