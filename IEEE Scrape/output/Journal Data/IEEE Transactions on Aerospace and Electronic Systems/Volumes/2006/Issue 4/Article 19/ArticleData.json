Specular reflection from sea causes large peak errors in the measurement of low elevation angle. An algorithm based on complex indicated angle is derived to reduce specular reflection component. From the complex indicated angle and the exactly known or approximately known data, the authors can generate a specular reflection error finding function (SREFF). SREFF clearly indicates where the measurements are much affected by the specular reflection in the complex indicated angle data.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "inspec": "9335875", "volume": "42", "date_publication": "October 2006", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "October 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Myung Soo Chung", "Jeong-soo Lim", "Dong Chul Park"], "keywords": ["marine radar", "phased array radar", "radar tracking", "search radar", "target tracking", "complex indicated angle data", "monopulse tracking", "phased array search radar", "sea surface", "specular reflection component", "specular reflection error finding function", "Acoustic reflection", "Data mining", "Optical reflection", "Phased arrays", "Radar imaging", "Radar measurements", "Radar tracking", "Sea measurements", "Sea surface", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "4107983"}
