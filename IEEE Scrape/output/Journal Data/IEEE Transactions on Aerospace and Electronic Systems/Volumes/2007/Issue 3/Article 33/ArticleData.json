A new approach to data association based on the competitive Hopfield neural network (CHNN) is investigated, where the matching between radar measurements and existing target tracks is used as a criterion to achieve a global consideration. Embedded within the CHNN is a competitive learning algorithm that resolves the dilemma of occasional irrational solutions in traditional Hopfield neural networks. Additionally, it is also shown that our proposed CHNN-based network is guaranteed to converge to a stable state in performing data association and the CHNN-based data association combined with an MTT system demonstrates target tracking capability. Computer simulation results indicate that this approach successfully solves the data association problems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1180", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1188", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9667850", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1180 - 1188", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yi-Nung Chung", "Pao-Hua Chou", "Maw-Rong Yang", "Hsin-Ta Chen"], "keywords": ["Hopfield neural nets", "radar tracking", "sensor fusion", "target tracking", "competitive Hopfield neural network", "competitive learning", "data association", "radar multiple-target tracking", "Computer simulation", "Cost function", "Hopfield neural networks", "Neural networks", "Neurons", "Partitioning algorithms", "Radar measurements", "Radar tracking", "Surveillance", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "4383609"}
