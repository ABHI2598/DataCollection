By using the difference between the forward-backward spatial smoothing matrix and its complex conjugation, the GCD method constructs a generalized covariance matrix, which can fully eliminate spatially nonuniform noise and fit for more general noise fields and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. In addition, it can also resolve coherent and incoherent sources. The GCD covariance matrix is an imaginary-valued matrix which can reduce computational burden. By analyzing the characteristic of GCD, a rapid root-MUSIC method without eigendecomposition is also given which can further reduce computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the GCD method can effectively eliminate nonuniform noise, and it possesses a lower SNR threshold as well as a smaller variance than that of conventional methods.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1195", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1204", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9732383", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1195 - 1204", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Chongying Qi", "Zhijie Chen", "Yongliang Wang", "Yongshun Zhang"], "keywords": ["covariance matrices", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "signal classification", "smoothing methods", "DOA estimation", "direction of arrival estimation", "forward-backward spatial smoothing matrix", "generalized covariance differencing algorithm", "generalized covariance matrix", "imaginary-valued matrix", "incoherent sources", "rapid root-MUSIC method", "signal-to-noise ratio", "unknown nonuniform noise fields", "Computational complexity", "Covariance matrix", "Direction of arrival estimation", "Gaussian noise", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Signal resolution", "Signal to noise ratio", "Spatial resolution", "Symmetric matrices", "Working environment noise", ""], "arnumber": "4383611"}
