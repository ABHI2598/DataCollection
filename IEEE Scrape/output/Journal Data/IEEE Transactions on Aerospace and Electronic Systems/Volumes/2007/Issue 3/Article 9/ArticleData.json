Specially-tailored pulses are utilized to diminish the number of false-lock points of the code discriminator response and to improve the multipath mitigation capability. The code loop includes only four real correlators (two extra correlators are required for the simplified bump-jumping algorithm with BOC(n,n) signals). Results obtained with BOC(n,n) and BOC(2n,n) signals show that this technique eliminates the multipath ranging errors for reflected rays with relative delays typically above twenty percent of the spreading code chip duration, thus comparing favorably with the conventional receiver correlation techniques.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "951", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "964", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9732371", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "951 - 964", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Fernando D.
