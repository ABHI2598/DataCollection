For targets with little to no radial velocity component, though, it can become quite difficult to differentiate targets from the surrounding sea clutter. This paper addresses the detection of slow-moving targets in sea clutter using a high resolution radar (HRR) such that the target has perceptible extent in range. Under the assumption of completely random sea clutter spikes based on an epsiv-contaminated mixture model with the signal and clutter powers known, optimal detection performance results from using the likelihood ratio test (LRT). However, for realistic sea clutter, the clutter spikes tend to be a localized phenomenon. Based upon observations from real radar data measurements, a heuristic approach exploiting a salient aspect of the idealized LRT is developed which is shown to perform well when applied to real measured sea clutter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "965", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "974", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9732372", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "965 - 974", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Shannon D.
