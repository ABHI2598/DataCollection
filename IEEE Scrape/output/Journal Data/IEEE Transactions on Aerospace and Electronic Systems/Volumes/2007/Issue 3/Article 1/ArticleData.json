For the derivation a linear quadratic differential games formulation of the end-game interception scenario is used. Conditions for achieving perfect intercept are given and new game spaces are presented. It is also shown that increasing the direct lift associated with the canard control allows intercepting targets with higher maneuvering capability, while for the tail control the effect is opposite.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "834", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "842", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9732366", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "834 - 842", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Tal Shima", "Oded M.
