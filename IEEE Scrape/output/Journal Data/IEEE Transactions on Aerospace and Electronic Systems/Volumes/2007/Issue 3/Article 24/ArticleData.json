The proposed algorithm is closely connected to a general pattern recognition technique. Each star is characterized by a well-defined pattern that can be determined by the surrounding stars. The so-called grid algorithm is one of the star identification algorithms based upon the pattern recognition approach. The proposed algorithm, is motivated by the conventional grid algorithm. To enhance the performance of the conventional grid algorithm, a modified method using polar grid, virtual grid, and multi-references is proposed. Simulation study is conducted for the demonstration of the new algorithm. The proposed modified grid approach turns out to make the grid algorithm more robust and reliable.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1112", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1116", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9680833", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1112 - 1116", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hyunjae Lee", "Hyochoong Bang"], "keywords": ["attitude measurement", "pattern recognition", "conventional grid algorithm", "modified grid algorithm", "pattern recognition approach", "polar grid", "spacecraft attitude determination", "star pattern identification technique", "virtual grid", "Charge coupled devices", "Computer architecture", "Databases", "Mesh generation", "Noise generators", "Noise robustness", "Pattern matching", "Pattern recognition", "Position measurement", "Space vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "4383600"}
