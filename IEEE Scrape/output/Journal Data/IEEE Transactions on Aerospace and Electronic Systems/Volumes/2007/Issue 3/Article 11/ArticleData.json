Low complexity reduced-rank receiver structures are particularly appealing because the number of filter coefficients can be much larger than the rank of the ST signal model. This paper proposes a new Householder-based multistage Wiener filter (HMSWF) structure for estimating the coefficients of an ST navigation receiver. Both floating point and fixed point arithmetic implementations are considered. The computational complexity of the HMSWF compares favorably with the other MSWF methods reported in literature. Furthermore, the use of Householder transformations at each stage ensures unitary blocking and numerically robust behavior even in finite-precision implementations. Simulations studies verify that the proposed ST navigation receiver based on the HMSWF outperforms other MSWF methods in the antijamming (A,J) task.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "975", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "988", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9710184", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "975 - 988", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Stefan Werner", "Matias With", "Visa Koivunen"], "keywords": ["Wiener filters", "computational complexity", "radar receivers", "radionavigation", "Householder multistage Wiener filter", "MSWF methods", "computational complexity", "degrees of freedom", "navigation receivers", "space time processing", "Computational complexity", "Computational modeling", "Fixed-point arithmetic", "Jamming", "Narrowband", "Navigation", "Robustness", "Space technology", "Wideband", "Wiener filter", ""], "arnumber": "4383587"}
