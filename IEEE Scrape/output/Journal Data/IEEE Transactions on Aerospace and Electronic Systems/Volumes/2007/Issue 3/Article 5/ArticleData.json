To this end, after briefly outlining the model of the received echo, a suitable detection structure is derived, and its performance is expressed in closed form as a function of the clutter statistical properties and of the space-time code matrix. Interestingly, this receiver requires prior knowledge of the clutter covariance, but the detection threshold is functionally independent thereof. At the transmitter design stage, we give two criteria for code construction: the first is based on the classical Chernoff bound, the second is an information-theoretic criterion. Interestingly, the two criteria lead to the same condition for code optimality, which in turn specializes, under the assumption of uncorrelated clutter and square code matrix, in some well-known full-rate space-time codes. A thorough performance assessment is also given, so as to establish the optimum achievable performance for MIMO radar systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "886", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "898", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9732369", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "886 - 898", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Antonio De Maio", "Marco Lops"], "keywords": ["MIMO communication", "radar detection", "Chernoff bound", "MIMO radar detectors", "clutter covariance", "code construction", "design principles", "detection threshold", "information theoretic criterion", "multiple input multiple output radars", "space time coding", "Clutter", "Detectors", "MIMO", "Radar antennas", "Radar detection", "Radar imaging", "Radar scattering", "Radar theory", "Receiving antennas", "Spaceborne radar", ""], "arnumber": "4383581"}
