The approach, denoted as pulse compression repair (PCR), utilizes a previously developed adaptive technique to operate on the match filtered output treating the resulting waveform autocorrelation as if it were the transmitted waveform thus \"repairing\" the effects of range-sidelobe masking that are induced by matched filtering. Illustrative results are presented comparing PCR with the matched filter and the CLEAN algorithm which demonstrate significant performance advantages for PCR as well as robustness to Doppler mismatch and system errors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1188", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1195", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9732382", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1188 - 1195", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Karl Gerlach", "Shannon D.
