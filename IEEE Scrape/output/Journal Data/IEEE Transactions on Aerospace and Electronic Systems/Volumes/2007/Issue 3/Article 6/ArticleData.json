The kinematics of the engagement for both manoeuvring and nonmanoeuvring target are developed and expressed in differential geometric terms. Two-dimensional geometry is then used to determine the intercept conditions for a straight line target and a constant manoeuvre target. The intercept conditions for both targets are developed for the case when the interceptor missile guides onto a straight line interception. These two cases are shown to have a common set of core conditions such that it enables a unified guidance law to be developed. The guidance law is shown to be globally stable using Lyapunov theory, so that guidance capture is assured for any initial condition. The analysis and guidance law design does not rely on local linearisation and can be shown to produce guidance trajectories that mirror proportional navigation for the straight line interception of a nonmanoeuvring target for which proportional navigation was originally developed. The paper finishes with simulation in two dimensions, illustrating the convergence and solution properties of the approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "899", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "919", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9664770", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "899 - 919", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["B.
