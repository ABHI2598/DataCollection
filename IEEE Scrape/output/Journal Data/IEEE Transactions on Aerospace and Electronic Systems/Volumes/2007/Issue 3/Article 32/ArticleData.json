If the actual variances are applied, then TOA and TDOA are known to have equal performance. However, if suboptimal weighting matrices are applied either due to inaccurate knowledge of measurement error statistics or for simplified implementations in practice, there are performance losses proportional to the number of ranging sources.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1177", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1180", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9732381", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1177 - 1180", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ju-yong Do", "Matthew Rabinowitz", "Per Enge"], "keywords": ["Monte Carlo methods", "error statistics", "measurement errors", "time-of-arrival estimation", "suboptimal weighting matrices", "time difference of arrival", "time of arrival", "Covariance matrix", "Error analysis", "Least squares approximation", "Loss measurement", "Measurement errors", "Performance loss", "Position measurement", "Robustness", "Time difference of arrival", "Time measurement", ""], "arnumber": "4383608"}
