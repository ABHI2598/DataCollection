This approach applies and improves off-the-shelf products of IPM without significantly changing original packaging and fabrication process. It can reduce a device's p-n junction-temperature rise by 20% at an equivalent load, thus increasing operating ambient temperatures, which is desirable for aircraft applications. The size and volume associated with a conventional cooling mechanism can be reduced, achieving improved compactness and power density.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1052", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1058", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9732374", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1052 - 1058", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jie Chang", "Changming Liao"], "keywords": ["p-n junctions", "packaging", "power convertors", "DSC-IPM", "compact converters", "dual side cooling", "elevated temperatures", "fabrication process", "integrated power modules", "original packaging", "p-n junction", "power density", "temperature rise", "two-side cooling", "AC motors", "Aerospace electronics", "Aerospace industry", "Aircraft", "Cooling", "Electronics industry", "Multichip modules", "Packaging", "Power electronics", "Temperature", ""], "arnumber": "4383591"}
