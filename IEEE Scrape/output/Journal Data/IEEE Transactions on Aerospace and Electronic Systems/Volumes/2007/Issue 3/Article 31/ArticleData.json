While a Kalman filter is usually employed to fuse the GPS and INS measurements, this approach requires a priori knowledge on the stochastic and deterministic parameters of both systems. In practice, these unknown parameters are often determined by trial and error. We propose an expectation-maximization (EM) method here to estimate these unknowns in a maximum likelihood (ML) framework. In particular, we employ a delta operator model to approximate the continuous-time system instead of the conventional shift operator model. The proposed method achieves simultaneous positioning and unknown parameter estimation. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we derive the posterior Cramer-Rao bound (PCRB) of our model and compare the performance with adaptive Kalman filtering technique. Both real and simulated data arc used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed EM-based method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1168", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1177", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9900152", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1168 - 1177", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Dongliang Huang", "Henry Leung", "Naser EL-SHEIMY"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "Kalman filters", "expectation-maximisation algorithm", "inertial navigation", "Kalman filter", "continuous-time system", "expectation maximization based GPS-INS integration", "global positioning system", "inertial navigation system", "maximum likelihood framework", "posterior Cramer-Rao bound", "Adaptive filters", "Covariance matrix", "Filtering", "Global Positioning System", "Inertial navigation", "Kalman filters", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Parameter estimation", "Technological innovation", "Working environment noise", ""], "arnumber": "4383607"}
