It is shown that two additional terms are required to account for frequency hopping and electronic beam pointing. The corrected weather radar equation provides a basis for accurate and efficient computation of a reflectivity estimate from the weather signal data samples. Lastly, an understanding of calibration requirements for these advanced weather radars is shown to follow naturally from the theoretical framework.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1220", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1227", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9710190", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1220 - 1227", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jeffrey B.
