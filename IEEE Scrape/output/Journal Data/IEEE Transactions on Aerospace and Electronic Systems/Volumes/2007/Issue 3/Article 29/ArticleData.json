In this correspondence, a new algorithm referred to as the iterated unscented Kalman filter (IUKF) is proposed based on the analysis and comparison of conventional nonlinear tracking problem. The algorithm is developed from UKF but it can obtain more accurate state and covariance estimation. Compared with the traditional approaches (e.g., extended Kalman filter (EKF) and UKF) used in passive localization, the proposed method has potential advantages in robustness, convergence speed, and tracking accuracy. The correctness as well as validity of the algorithm is demonstrated through numerical simulation and experiment results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1155", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1163", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9710188", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1155 - 1163", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ronghui Zhan", "Jianwei Wan"], "keywords": ["Kalman filters", "covariance analysis", "iterative methods", "target tracking", "covariance estimation", "iterated unscented Kalman filter", "passive target tracking", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Convergence", "Filtering", "Jacobian matrices", "Nonlinear systems", "Numerical simulation", "Observability", "Robustness", "State estimation", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "4383605"}
