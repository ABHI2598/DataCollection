Using the paradigm of network enabled operations (NEOPS), the problem is formulated as a transient stochastic game with communication where the appropriate strategy takes the form of an optimal stationary correlated equilibrium. Under this strategy, ships cooperate through real-time communication to satisfy both local and collective interests. The use of communication results in a performance improvement over the noncommunicating, Nash equilibrium scenario. This framework allows us to develop a theoretical foundation for NEOPS and captures the trade-off between information exchange and performance, while generalizing the standard Nash equilibrium solution for the missile deflection game given in [1], The NEOPS equilibrium strategy is characterized as the solution to an optimization problem with linear objective and bilinear constraints, which can be solved calculating successive improvements starting from an initial noncooperative (Nash) solution. The communication overhead required to implement this strategy is associated with the mutual information between individual action probability distributions at equilibrium. Numerical results illustrate the trade-off between communication and performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "843", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "863", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9732367", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "843 - 863", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Michael Maskery", "Vikram Krishnamurthy"], "keywords": ["electronic countermeasures", "missiles", "stochastic games", "Nash equilibrium scenario", "antiship missiles", "correlation equilibrium", "countermeasures deployment", "missile deflection games", "network-enabled missile deflection", "optimal stationary correlated equilibrium", "transient stochastic game", "Constraint optimization", "Constraint theory", "Game theory", "Marine vehicles", "Missiles", "Mutual information", "Nash equilibrium", "Probability distribution", "Standards development", "Stochastic processes", ""], "arnumber": "4383578"}
