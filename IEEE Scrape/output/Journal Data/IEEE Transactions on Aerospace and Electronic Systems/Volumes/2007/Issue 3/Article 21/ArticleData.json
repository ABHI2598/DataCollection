Based on these assumptions, the Kalman filter is widely used in single or multiple filter versions (e.g., in an interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator). The oversimplification resulting from the above assumptions can cause degradation in tracking performance. In this paper we explore the application of Kalman-Levy filter to handle maneuvering targets. This filter assumes a heavy-tailed noise distribution known as the Levy distribution. Due to the heavy-tailed nature of the assumed distribution, the Kalman-Levy filter is more effective in the presence of large errors that can occur, for example, due to the onset of acceleration or deceleration. However, for the same reason, the performance of the Kalman-Levy filter in the nonmaneuvering portion of track is worse than that of a Kalman filter. For this reason, an IMM with one Kalman and one Kalman-Levy module is developed here. Also, the superiority of the IMM with Kalman-Levy module over only Kalman-filter-based IMM for realistic maneuvers is shown by simulation results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1099", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1107", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9677507", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1099 - 1107", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
