In scan-based localization, knowledge of radar scan rate and radar beam intercept times are used to determine subtended angles of the radar location from receiver pairs. A collection of subtended angles is utilized to estimate the radar location. The paper presents a maximum likelihood (ML) scan-based localization algorithm and derives the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLH) for emitter location estimate. Based on maximization of the determinant of the Fisher information matrix, online gradient-based receiver trajectory optimization algorithms are developed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated with simulation examples.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1117", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1125", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9710186", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "1117 - 1125", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kutluyil Dogancay"], "keywords": ["maximum likelihood estimation", "radar receivers", "radar tracking", "target tracking", "Cramer-Rao lower bound", "Fisher information matrix", "emitter location estimation", "maximum likelihood scan-based localization algorithm", "online optimization", "passive geolocation technique", "radar location", "radar scan rate", "receiver trajectories", "scan-based emitter localization", "stationary pulsed radars", "Electronic warfare", "Indoor environments", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Military communication", "Passive radar", "Radar antennas", "Radar tracking", "Target tracking", "Time difference of arrival", "Time measurement", ""], "arnumber": "4383601"}
