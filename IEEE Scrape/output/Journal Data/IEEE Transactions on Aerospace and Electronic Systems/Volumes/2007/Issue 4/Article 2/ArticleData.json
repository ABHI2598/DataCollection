This paper addresses the following questions: 1. How do we quantify the classification performance of a sensor? 2. What happens to the posterior probabilities as the number of measurements increase? 3. Will the targets be classified correctly? While the Kalman filter allows for off-line estimation of kinematic performance (covariance matrix), a comparable approach for studying classification accuracy has not been done previously. We develop a new analytical approach for computing the long-run classification performance of a sensor and also present recursive formulas for efficient calculation of the same. We show that, under a minimal condition, a sensor will eventually classify all targets perfectly. We also develop a methodology for evaluating the classification performance of multi-sensor fusion systems involving sensors of varying quality. The contributions of this paper are 1. A simple metric to quantify a sensor's ability to discriminate between the targets being identified, and its use in comparing multiple sensors, 2. An approximate formula based on this metric to compute off-line estimates of the rate of convergence toward perfect classification, and the number of measurements required to achieve a desired level of classification accuracy, and 3. The use of this metric to evaluate classification performance of multi-sensor fusion systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1265", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1281", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825894", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1265 - 1281", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Eswar Sivaraman", "Kuo-chu Chang"], "keywords": ["covariance matrices", "recursive estimation", "sensor fusion", "target tracking", "Kalman filter", "covariance matrix", "kinematic performance", "multisensor classification systems", "multisensor fusion systems", "off-line estimation", "performance evaluation", "recursive formulas", "target identification", "Accuracy", "Convergence", "Covariance matrix", "Kinematics", "Operations research", "Performance analysis", "Sensor fusion", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Sensor systems", "Systems engineering and theory", ""], "arnumber": "4441738"}
