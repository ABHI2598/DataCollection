The model of the guidance control system reflects the most important characteristics of the flight control system that combines airframe and autopilot dynamics (damping, natural frequency, time constant, and airframe zero frequency). The analytical expressions for frequency response and related expressions for missile system performance are given. The analytical results obtained can be utilized for missile system design.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1544", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1552", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825913", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1544 - 1552", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Rafael Yanushevsky"], "keywords": ["aircraft control", "aircraft navigation", "frequency response", "frequency-domain analysis", "missile guidance", "airframe zero frequency", "autopilot dynamics", "flight control system characteristics", "frequency domain approach", "frequency response", "guidance control system design", "missile system design", "missile system performance", "proportional navigation guidance system", "Acceleration", "Aerospace control", "Control theory", "Damping", "Frequency domain analysis", "Frequency response", "Missiles", "Navigation", "Performance analysis", "System performance", ""], "arnumber": "4441757"}
