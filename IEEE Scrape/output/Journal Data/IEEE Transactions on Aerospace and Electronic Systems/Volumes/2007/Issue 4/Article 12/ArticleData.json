An efficient algorithm for tracking in this environment is presented here. This approach makes use of estimates of the probability of target existence, which is an integral part of the algorithm. This allows for the efficient generation and management of possible target hypotheses, yielding an algorithm with performance that matches what can be obtained by multiple hypothesis tracking-based approaches, but at a significantly lower computational cost. This paper considers only the single target case for clarity. The extension to multiple targets is easily incorporated into this framework. Simulation studies are given that show the effectiveness of this approach in the presence of heavy and nonuniform clutter when tracking a target in an environment of low probability of detection and in an environment where the target performs violent manoeuvres.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1409", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1425", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825904", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1409 - 1425", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Darko Musicki", "Barbara F.
