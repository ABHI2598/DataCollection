A recursively updated linear model representing the pilot-aircraft system is used to continuously check for stability loss. The instability-related oscillations are detected early, using a statistical hypothesis test. Furthermore, a specially designed stability augmentation system assists the pilot during the instability periods. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated via data obtained from a flight simulator and a detailed simulation model.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1385", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1396", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825902", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1385 - 1396", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Dimitrios G.
