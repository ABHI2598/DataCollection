Previously, the missing amplitude and phase estimation-expectation maximization (MAPES-EM) algorithms were developed for the general 1-D missing-data problem and shown to have excellent spectral estimation performance. In this correspondence, we present 2-D extensions of MAPES-EM and develop another 2-D MAPES algorithm, referred to as MAPES-CM, which solves a maximum likelihood problem iteratively via cyclic maximization (CM). Compared with MAPES-EM, MAPES-CM has similar spectral estimation performance but is computationally much more efficient, which is especially important for long data sequences and 2-D applications such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1604", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1616", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825917", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1604 - 1616", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yanwei Wang", "P.
