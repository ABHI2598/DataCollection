Two sources of knowledge are presented and incorporated within the classification algorithms: 1) statistical knowledge on radar target echo features, and 2) physical knowledge, represented via the locomotion models for different targets. The statistical knowledge is represented by distribution models whose parameters are estimated using a collected database. The physical knowledge is represented by target locomotion and radar measurements models. Various concepts to incorporate these sources of knowledge are presented. These concepts are tested using real data of radar echo records, which include three target classes: one person, two persons and vehicle. A combined approach, which implements both statistical and physical prior knowledge provides the best classification performance, and it achieves a classification rate of 99% in the three-class problem in high signal-to-noise conditions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1510", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1522", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825911", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1510 - 1522", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Igal Bilik", "Joseph Tabrikian"], "keywords": ["Doppler radar", "biomechanics", "pattern classification", "radar cross-sections", "radar target recognition", "statistical analysis", "surveillance", "Doppler signatures", "distribution models", "ground surveillance Doppler radars", "human locomotion models", "moving vehicle", "physical knowledge", "radar measurements models", "radar target classification", "radar target echo features", "signal-to-noise conditions", "statistical knowledge", "target locomotion models", "walking person", "walking person pairs", "Doppler radar", "Humans", "Radar applications", "Radar cross section", "Radar imaging", "Radar measurements", "Radar tracking", "Sensor systems", "Surveillance", "Target recognition", ""], "arnumber": "4441755"}
