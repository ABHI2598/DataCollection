The proposed method uses a linear equalizer that is derived using Kalman filtering theory, which has been used successfully for channel equalization for high-speed communication systems. We illustrate the proposed method with numerical examples obtained from simulations that show the improvement in bit error rate performance (BER) for two modulation schemes using (ARTM) tier-1 waveforms currently used in aeronautical telemetry systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1624", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1630", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825919", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1624 - 1630", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["O.
