However, even under ideal conditions the broadcast signals have some degree of deformation as a result of the practical individual hardware implementation. For the most demanding users of satellite navigation, such as aircraft navigation and landing systems, it is important to characterize the nominal signal structure in order to detect minimal variations resulting from hardware-based errors. Thus far such precorrelation Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal quality monitoring has been performed through high gain antennas, which allow for raising the GNSS spectrum above the thermal noise floor and observing the structure of the signal directly at the front end output. This paper describes a new approach to achieve such observability based on signal processing techniques, such as dithering and averaging, which leverage the repetitive nature of the GNSS signal. The paper presents how these techniques can drastically improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in postprocessing, allowing for the direct analysis of GNSS signals using traditional front end designs and conventional antennas. Results are predicted using the appropriate theory and validated using data collected from the Global Positioning System (GPS).", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1553", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1566", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825914", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1553 - 1566", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Marco Pini", "Dennis M.
