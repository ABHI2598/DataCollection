The multiple models are designed to account for target maneuvers including \"move-stop-move\" and motion ambiguity at an intersection; the time-varying active model sets are adaptively selected based on target state and local terrain condition. The hybrid state space is partitioned into the mode subspace and the target subspace. The mode state is estimated based on random sampling; the target state as well as the relevant likelihood function associated with a mode sample sequence is approximated as Gaussian distribution, of which the conditional mean and covariance are deterministically computed using a nonlinear Kalman filter which accounts for road constraints in its update. The importance function for the sampling of the mode state approximates the optimal importance function under the same Gaussian assumption of the target state.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1454", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1469", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825907", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1454 - 1469", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yang Cheng", "Tarunraj Singh"], "keywords": ["Gaussian distribution", "Kalman filters", "Markov processes", "importance sampling", "nonlinear filters", "particle filtering (numerical methods)", "random processes", "road vehicles", "state estimation", "state-space methods", "target tracking", "vehicle dynamics", "Gaussian distribution", "conditional mean", "covariance", "hybrid state space", "jump Markov linear Gaussian systems", "local terrain condition", "mode sample sequence", "mode state approximation", "mode state estimation", "nonlinear Kalman filter", "optimal importance function", "random sampling", "road-constrained target tracking", "target maneuvers", "time-varying active model sets", "variable-structure multiple-model particle filtering approach", "Filtering", "Motion estimation", "Nonlinear filters", "Particle filters", "Probability distribution", "Roads", "State estimation", "State-space methods", "Target tracking", "Uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "4441751"}
