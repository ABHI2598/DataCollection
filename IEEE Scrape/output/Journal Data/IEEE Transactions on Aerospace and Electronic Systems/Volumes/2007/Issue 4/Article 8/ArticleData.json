Each platform (decision maker) observes missile threats using a combination of shipboard sensor measurement data and data from other ships, but acts independently when controlling its own weapon systems to cooperatively pursue the defensive objectives of the task group in a decentralized fashion. The main results are a formulation of the missile deflection problem as a stochastic shortest path Markovian game with constraints, a characterization of the Nash equilibrium solution, and a decentralized algorithm for computing the Nash equilibrium when the stochastic game is collaborative. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the equilibrium policies and illustrate their sensitivity to the missile dynamics.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1351", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1372", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825900", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1351 - 1372", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Michael Maskery", "Vikram Krishnamurthy", "Christina O\u00bfregan"], "keywords": ["Markov processes", "decision making", "electronic countermeasures", "missiles", "stochastic games", "Nash equilibrium solution", "antiship missiles", "countermeasures", "decentralized algorithms", "decision maker", "missile deflection problem", "missile dynamics", "netcentric force protection", "shipboard sensor measurement", "stochastic shortest path Markovian game", "Collision mitigation", "Force sensors", "Marine vehicles", "Missiles", "Nash equilibrium", "Protection", "Radar countermeasures", "Sensor systems", "Stochastic processes", "Weapons", ""], "arnumber": "4441744"}
