To avoid this, a null phase-shift polarization (NPSP) filter is proposed, which is composed of a linear polarization transformer (LPVT), a conventional single-notch polarization (SNP) filter and an amplitude/phase compensation device (A/PCD). The interference, which has polarization different from those of the desired target signal, can be suppressed completely while the target signal remains without distortion. Some applications of high-frequency (HF) radars for suppressing the radio interference are introduced. Simulation results from the experimentally derived data indicate that the improvement of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can be expected to be more than 28 dB. The proposed NPSP filter is effective in HF radar or other coherent systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1397", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1408", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825903", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1397 - 1408", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Xing-peng Mao", "Ieee Yong-tan Liu"], "keywords": ["interference filters", "interference suppression", "radar signal processing", "transformers", "amplitude-phase compensation device", "coherent integration time", "high-frequency radar", "high-frequency radars", "linear polarization transformer", "null phase-shift polarization filtering", "radio interference", "signal integration", "signal-to-interference ratio", "single-notch polarization filter", "Adaptive filters", "Control engineering", "Distortion", "Electromagnetic interference", "Filtering", "Interference cancellation", "Interference suppression", "Nonlinear filters", "Polarization", "Radar applications", ""], "arnumber": "4441747"}
