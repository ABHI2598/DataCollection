Conventional direction-of-arrival (DOA) detection requires the use of an antenna array with multiple elements. Here we investigate the use of only two elements in the receiver array. The concept entails resolving the Doppler frequencies of the returned signals from the moving targets, and then measuring the phase difference at each Doppler frequency component to calculate the DOA of the targets. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the concept and to asses the DOA errors for multiple movers. An experimental system is designed and constructed to test the concept. The system consists of a two-element receiver array operating at 2.4 GHz. Measurement results of human subjects in indoor environments are presented, including through-wall scenarios.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1496", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1509", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825910", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1496 - 1509", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Adrian Lin", "Hao Ling"], "keywords": ["Doppler radar", "antenna arrays", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "object detection", "radar signal processing", "search radar", "target tracking", "DDOA radar", "DOA errors", "Doppler frequency component", "Doppler-and-direction-of-arrival radar", "antenna arrays", "conventional direction-of-arrival detection", "frequency 2.4 GHz", "indoor surveillance application", "low-cost two-element receiving array concept", "multiple moving target detection", "multiple-mover sensing", "Antenna arrays", "Antenna measurements", "Directive antennas", "Doppler radar", "Frequency measurement", "Phase measurement", "Radar antennas", "Radar detection", "Signal resolution", "Surveillance", ""], "arnumber": "4441754"}
