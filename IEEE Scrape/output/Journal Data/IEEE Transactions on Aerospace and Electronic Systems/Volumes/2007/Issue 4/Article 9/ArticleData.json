In common with other \"moment matching\" tracking algorithms such as the extended Kalman filter and its modern refinements, it approximates the prior conditional density of the target state by a normal density; the novel feature is that an exact calculation is then performed to update the conditional density in the light of the new measurement. The paper provides the theoretical justification of the algorithm. It also reports on simulations involving variants on two scenarios, which have been the basis of earlier comparative studies. The first is a \"benign\" scenario where the measurements are comparatively rich in range-related information; here the shifted Rayleigh filter is competitive with standard algorithms. The second is a more \"extreme\" scenario, involving multiple sensor platforms, high-dimensional models and noisy measurements; here the performance of the shifted Rayleigh filter matches the performance of a high-order bootstrap particle filter, while reducing the computational overhead by an order of magnitude.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1373", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "1384", "date_publication": "October 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9825901", "date": "October 2007", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "1373 - 1384", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
