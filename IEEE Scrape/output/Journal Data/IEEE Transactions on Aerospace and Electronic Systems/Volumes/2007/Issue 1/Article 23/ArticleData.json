This waveform was selected because it achieves approximately three times the spectral efficiency of PCM/FM, the legacy modulation in IRIG-106. However, the optimum receiver requires 128 real-valued matched filters and keeps track of the waveform state with a trellis of 512 states and 2048 branches. Various complexity-reducing techniques are applied and the resulting loss in detection efficiency is quantified. It is shown that the full 512-state trellis is not required to achieve desirable detection efficiency: two different 32-state configurations were found to perform within 0.05 dB of optimal; two different 16-state configurations were found to perform within 0.80 dB of optimal; and an 8-state configuration was found to perform within 1.05 dB of optimal. The analysis and simulation results show that to achieve a given state complexity, proper combination of two or more complexity-reducing techniques generally outperforms the use of a single complexity-reducing technique", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "286", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "300", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457769", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "286 - 300", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Erik Perrins", "Michael Rice"], "keywords": ["aircraft communication", "communication complexity", "continuous phase modulation", "radiotelemetry", "signal detection", "trellis coded modulation", "IRIG-106 standard", "aeronautical telemetry", "complexity-reducing techniques", "legacy modulation", "matched filters", "multi-h CPM", "optimum receiver", "partial response continuous-phase modulation", "reduced-complexity detectors", "state complexity", "Analytical models", "Computer science", "Detectors", "Frequency modulation", "Matched filters", "Maximum likelihood detection", "Phase change materials", "Pulse modulation", "Quadrature phase shift keying", "Telemetry", ""], "arnumber": "4194772"}
