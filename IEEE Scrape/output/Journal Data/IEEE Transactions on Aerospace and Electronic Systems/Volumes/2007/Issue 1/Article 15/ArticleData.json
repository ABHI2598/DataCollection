In particular, a traffic class dependent (TCD) routing is proposed with different optimization criteria for different traffic classes. Furthermore, for delay sensitive traffic, performance is enhanced by an exponential smoothing link-cost function, which reduces traffic load oscillations in the network. The performance of the proposed procedures is evaluated in two different traffic scenarios using an appropriate simulation model", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "187", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "196", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457761", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "187 - 196", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ales Svigelj", "Mihael Mohorcic", "Gorazd Kandus"], "keywords": ["oscillations", "satellite links", "telecommunication network routing", "telecommunication traffic", "ISL network", "adaptive per-hop routing", "delay sensitive traffic", "intersatellite link network", "nongeostationary satellite system", "oscillation suppression", "packet-switched", "traffic class dependent routing", "Bandwidth", "Communication system traffic", "Electronic mail", "Internet", "Low earth orbit satellites", "Quality of service", "Routing", "Smoothing methods", "Telecommunication traffic", "Traffic control", ""], "arnumber": "4194764"}
