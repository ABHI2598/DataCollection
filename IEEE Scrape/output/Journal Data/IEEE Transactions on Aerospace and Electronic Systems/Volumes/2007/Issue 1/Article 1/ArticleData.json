The new approach uses a least square scheme to solve a general two-dimensional (2-D) TFF in a vertical plane. In the mathematical process, Chebyshev polynomials are used to model the geographical data of the terrain in a given route in a manner suitable for the aircraft at hand. The aircraft then follows the modeled terrain with sufficient clearance. In this approach the terrain following (TF) problem is effectively converted to an optimal tracking problem. Results show that this method provides a flexible approach to solve the TFF problem especially in conditions where the existing terrain to be flown over is not mathematically well behaved", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457747", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "2 - 12", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
