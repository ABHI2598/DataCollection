The MF-GPS receiver provides raw GPS measurements for pseudo-range and range rate to compute the navigation solutions (position and velocity) and also multi-antenna carrier phase interferometric measurements to estimate the aircraft attitude solution, if the carrier phase data is reliable. A multi-mode navigation filter is designed which combines state and measurement fusion methods and processes the SRIMU and raw MF-GPS outputs to provide reliable position, velocity and attitude information, and also kinematic parameters required in control, guidance, and navigation applications. The feasibility and performance of this integrated design is assessed and evaluated by using simulation. The accuracy of inertial gyros used in the evaluation ranges from ldeg/h to 30deg/h, including low-cost inertial sensor technologies. The simulation studies presented here show that a multi-mode navigation filter can achieve sufficient reliability and accuracy and that SRIMU/MF-GPS integrated navigation systems may provide a cost-effective system for future regional aircraft, general aviation aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "371", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "391", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457775", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "371 - 391", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["David J.
