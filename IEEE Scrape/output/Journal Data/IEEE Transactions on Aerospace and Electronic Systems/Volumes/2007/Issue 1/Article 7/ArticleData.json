The system is conceived as an elastic spherical rover, exploiting wind propulsion for surface motion, while adopting an active mechanism for vertical jumping over obstacles. The use of polymeric electromechanical devices is envisaged in order to provide actuation to such a jumping mechanism. Among the available EAP technologies, new contractile linear actuators based on dielectric elastomers arc proposed in this study as suitable devices and two potential solutions concerning their use are designed, modeled, and evaluated via numerical simulations. The best solution reveals interesting simulated performances, enabling jumping of obstacle heights corresponding to more than 7% of the diameter of the rover", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "79", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "92", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457753", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "79 - 92", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Federico Carpi", "Aldo Tralli", "Danilo De Rossi", "Paolo Gaudenzi"], "keywords": ["Mars", "actuators", "collision avoidance", "mobile robots", "planetary rovers", "propulsion", "European Space Agency", "Mars surface", "elastic spherical rover", "electroactive polymer actuators", "jumping mechanism", "jumping rover", "robotic locomotion system", "surface motion", "vertical jumping", "wind propulsion", "Aerospace materials", "Building materials", "Concrete", "Contracts", "Energy consumption", "Hydraulic actuators", "Mars", "Polymers", "Space exploration", "Space technology", ""], "arnumber": "4194756"}
