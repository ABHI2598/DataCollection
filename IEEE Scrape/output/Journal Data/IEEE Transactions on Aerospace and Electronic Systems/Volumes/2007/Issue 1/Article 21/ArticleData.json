Unfortunately, for vehicle attitudes where more than one of these antennas has a clear path to the receiving station, this practice also leads to self-interference nulls, resulting in dramatic degradation in the average signal integrity. This paper discusses application of unitary space-time codes such as the Alamouti transmit diversity scheme and unitary differential space-time codes to overcome the self-interference effect observed in such systems. The mathematical foundations of these techniques within the context of this application as well as computational performance gains associated with their implementation are provided. Issues such as the cost of channel estimation for trained techniques as well as the throughput performance of nondifferential and differential schemes for realistic air-vehicle motion are analyzed", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "262", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "272", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457767", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "262 - 272", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Michael A.
