The nonlinear optimal guidance law (NOGL) is obtained by numerically solving the stochastic optimization problem. Since the certainty equivalence principle is not valid in the investigated problem, the resulting NOGL depends on the conditional probability density function of the estimated states. It is shown that the NOGL is also nonlinear in the estimated zero effort miss distance, and that the probability density function of the miss distance is non-Gaussian. The dependence of the new guidance law on the acceleration limit is investigated and it is shown that only for an extremely large acceleration limit does the proposed guidance law degenerate to the classical optimal linear one", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "71", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "78", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457752", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "71 - 78", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Gyorgy Hexner", "Tal Shima"], "keywords": ["missile guidance", "optimisation", "position control", "stochastic processes", "acceleration limit", "bounded acceleration", "missile guidance", "nonGaussian miss distance", "nonlinear optimal guidance law", "probability density function", "stochastic optimal control guidance law", "stochastic optimization problem", "zero effort miss distance", "Acceleration", "Aerodynamics", "Approximation methods", "Costs", "Missiles", "Navigation", "Optimal control", "Probability density function", "State estimation", "Stochastic processes", ""], "arnumber": "4194755"}
