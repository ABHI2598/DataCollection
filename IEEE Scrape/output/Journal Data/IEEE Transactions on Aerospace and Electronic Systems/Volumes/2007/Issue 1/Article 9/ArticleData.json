First MSTAR image chips are represented as fine and raw feature vectors, where raw features compensate for the target pose estimation error that corrupts fine image features. Then, the chips are classified by using the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm with the radial basis function (RBF) network as the base learner. Since the RBF network is a binary classifier, the multiclass problem was decomposed into a set of binary ones through the error-correcting output codes (ECOC) method, specifying a dictionary of code words for the set of three possible classes. AdaBoost combines the classification results of the RBF network for each binary problem into a code word, which is then \"decoded\" as one of the code words (i.e., ground-vehicle classes) in the specified dictionary. Along with classification, within the AdaBoost framework, we also conduct efficient fusion of the fine and raw image-feature vectors. The results of large-scale experiments demonstrate that our ATR scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art systems reported in the literature", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "112", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "125", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457755", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "112 - 125", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yijun Sun", "Zhipeng Liu", "Sinisa Todorovic", "Jian Li"], "keywords": ["image classification", "object recognition", "radial basis function networks", "road vehicles", "synthetic aperture radar", "target tracking", "AdaBoost algorithm", "RBF", "SAR automatic target recognition", "adaptive boosting", "error-correcting output codes method", "ground vehicle classification", "image chips", "radial basis function network", "target acquisition", "Boosting", "Decoding", "Dictionaries", "Estimation error", "Image databases", "Land vehicles", "Large-scale systems", "Radial basis function networks", "Spatial databases", "Target recognition", ""], "arnumber": "4194758"}
