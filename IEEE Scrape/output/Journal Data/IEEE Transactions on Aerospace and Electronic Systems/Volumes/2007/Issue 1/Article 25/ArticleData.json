With the backstepping technique, an adaptive controller is synthesized for the purpose of accomplishing desired responses under a wide range of flight envelope. The specification assignments for flying qualities are used for selecting essential parameters of the proposed adaptive controller for all flight conditions. In comparison with other conventional control methods, the proposed adaptive control law is much simpler and easier to construct and implement. Simulation results show that the proposed method is capable of giving desired closed-loop dynamic performance and robustness against uncertainties within the subsonic and supersonic flight conditions", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "311", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "329", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457771", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "311 - 329", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hann-Shing Ju", "Ching-Chih Tsai"], "keywords": ["adaptive control", "aerospace control", "aerospace simulation", "adaptive backstepping", "flight control law", "longitudinal axis", "Adaptive control", "Aerodynamics", "Aerospace control", "Aircraft", "Backstepping", "Control systems", "Pi control", "Programmable control", "Sliding mode control", "Uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "4194774"}
