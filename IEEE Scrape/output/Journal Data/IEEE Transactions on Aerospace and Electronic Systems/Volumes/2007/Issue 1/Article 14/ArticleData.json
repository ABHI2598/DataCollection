Three link parameters are investigated and their effects on the overall carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) are quantified. The first parameter is the intermodulation components that are generated at the nonlinear amplifier outputs and contribute to well-formed interference in the far-field radiation of the array. The second is the bit-error ratio (BER) degradation due to the multi-carrier operation of the active array. Measurement results are shown to demonstrate this effect. The third link parameter is the cochannel interference caused by frequency reuse in multiple-beam systems. The paper starts by reviewing early developments of phased arrays for multiple-beam satellite communications applications. A key component in these developments is the modular monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) beam-forming matrices that generate a number of simultaneous and independently digitally controlled beams", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "176", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "186", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457760", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "176 - 186", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Amir I.
