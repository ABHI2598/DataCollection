A phased array of many modest-size reflectors antennas is used to drastically improve the uplink effective isotropic radiated power of a ground station. A radar calibration procedure for the array phase distribution is presented using a number of in-orbit targets. Design of optimal orbit and the number of calibration targets is investigated for providing frequent calibration opportunities needed for compensating array elements phase center movements as the array tracks a spacecraft. Array far-field focusing based on the near-filed in-orbit (low Earth orbit (LEO)) calibration targets is also presented and array gain degradation analysis based on the position error of the array elements and in-orbit targets has been carried out. It is shown that errors in the in-orbit targets positions significantly degrade the far-field array gain while the errors in array elements positions are not very important. Analysis of phase errors caused by thermal noise, system instability, and atmospheric effects show insignificant array gain degradation by these factors", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "251", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "261", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457766", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "251 - 261", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kamal Sarabandi", "Feinian Wang"], "keywords": ["antenna phased arrays", "antenna radiation patterns", "calibration", "phased array radar", "reflector antennas", "space communication links", "array elements positions", "array far-field focusing", "array gain degradation analysis", "array phase distribution", "atmospheric effects", "deep-space communication", "in-orbit targets positions", "large reflectors phased array", "low Earth orbit calibration", "modest-size reflectors antennas", "near-filed in-orbit calibration", "optimal orbit", "phase errors analysis", "position error", "radar calibration", "system instability", "thermal noise", "uplink array calibration", "uplink effective isotropic radiated power", "Antenna arrays", "Calibration", "Low earth orbit satellites", "Phased arrays", "Radar antennas", "Radar tracking", "Reflector antennas", "Satellite ground stations", "Target tracking", "Thermal degradation", ""], "arnumber": "4194769"}
