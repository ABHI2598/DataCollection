Given knowledge of the prior probability of this assignment variable, data association is performed independently for each measurement. When the assignment prior is unknown, it can be estimated provided that it is either time independent, or fixed over the batch. This paper presents a new extension of the PMHT, which incorporates a randomly evolving Bayesian hyperparameter for the assignment process. This extension is referred to as the PMHT with hysteresis. The state of the hyperparameter reflects each model's contribution to the mixture, and thus can be used to quantify the significance of mixture components. The paper demonstrates how this can be used as a method for automated track maintenance in clutter. The performance benefit gained over the standard PMHT is demonstrated using simulations and real sensor data", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "93", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "111", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457754", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "93 - 111", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Samuel J.
