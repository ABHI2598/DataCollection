Both the ordinary radar with a single transmitter and receiver and the recently proposed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar are considered. A random target impulse response is used to model the scattering characteristics of the extended (nonpoint) target, and two radar waveform design problems with constraints on waveform power have been investigated. The first one is to design waveforms that maximize the conditional mutual information (MI) between the random target impulse response and the reflected waveforms given the knowledge of transmitted waveforms. The second one is to find transmitted waveforms that minimize the mean-square error (MSE) in estimating the target impulse response. Our analysis indicates that under the same total power constraint, these two criteria lead to the same solution for a matrix which specifies the essential part of the optimum waveform design. The solution employs water-filling to allocate the limited power appropriately. We also present an asymptotic formulation which requires less knowledge of the statistical model of the target", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "330", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "343", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457772", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "330 - 343", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yang Yang", "Rick S.
