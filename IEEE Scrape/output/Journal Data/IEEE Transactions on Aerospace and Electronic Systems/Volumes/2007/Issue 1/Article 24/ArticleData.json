The proposed law can lead vehicles to home on a target at a designated impact time with a prescribed impact angle. It comprises a feedback loop and an additional control command, the first to achieve the desired impact angle with zero miss distance, and the second to control the impact time. Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed law in the accuracy of impact angle and impact time", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "301", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "310", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457770", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "301 - 310", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jin-Ik Lee", "In-Soo Jeon", "Min-Jea Tahk"], "keywords": ["aerospace control", "feedback", "feedback loop", "flight vehicle", "guidance law", "homing problem", "impact angle control", "impact time control", "Aerospace engineering", "Azimuth", "Feedback loop", "Missiles", "Navigation", "Numerical simulation", "Optimal control", "Time factors", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", "Weapons", ""], "arnumber": "4194773"}
