This paper develops a novel particle filter (PF) for a discrete-time stochastic hybrid system. The novelty lies in the use of the exact Bayesian equations for the conditional mode probabilities given the observations. Therefore particles are needed for the Euclidean valued state component only. The novel particle filter is referred to as the interacting multiple model (IMM) particle filter (IMMPF) because it incorporates a filter step which is of the same form as the interaction step of the IMM algorithm. Through Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that the IMMPF has significant advantage over the standard PF, in particular for situations where conditional switching rate or conditional mode probabilities have small values", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "55", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "70", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457751", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "55 - 70", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Henk A.
