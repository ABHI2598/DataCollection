One fundamental issue of the UUV design is the dynamic position control system. This system plays a crucial role together with the sensor architecture in the degree of system autonomy that can be achieved. This paper is concerned with a few issues when dynamically positioning remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs). By restricting the operating regime of ROVs to slow velocity requirements the paper investigates the implementation of a few decentralized control strategies and compare their performance measures, which are assessed by simulating a nonlinear ROV system model for each control strategy. Issues concerning input tracking, disturbance rejection, and plant variations are discussed. The evaluations consider the use of linear PID feedback and feedforward variants, and a robust nonlinear control strategies applied to a full order, fully coupled, and nonlinear vehicle model. These evaluations consider a vehicle undertaking standard mission activities where the tether cable dynamics, with load estimates obtained from a lumped mass cable model, and the vehicle actuator system are present. The paper shows that much of the performance deterioration may be attributed mainly due to cable inertia. The authors also verify that the nonlinear robust control strategy does not necessarily allow for better performance over the linear feedback control strategies implemented when vehicle motions are confined to slow velocity profiles. These and other partial results will aid the design of the control system for an underwater vehicle currently under construction", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "214", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "226", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457763", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "214 - 226", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Eric Conrado De Souza", "Newton Maruyama"], "keywords": ["nonlinear control systems", "position control", "remotely operated vehicles", "underwater vehicles", "autonomous underwater vehicles", "dynamic position control", "dynamic positioning", "intelligent UUV", "intelligent unmanned underwater vehicles", "linear PID feedback", "remotely operated vehicles", "robust nonlinear control strategy", "Distributed control", "Intelligent vehicles", "Position control", "Remotely operated vehicles", "Robust control", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Sensor systems", "Underwater cables", "Underwater vehicles", "Vehicle dynamics", ""], "arnumber": "4194766"}
