Initially, an overview of geostationary satellite communication systems and payload technology is presented, followed by a description of the network architecture and protocols that are the basis of the simulation models. The results obtained from this testbed are presented before concluding with a discussion of the results obtained", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "197", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "213", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457762", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "197 - 213", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
