Fast simulation using IS methods has been notably successful in the study of conventional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) radar detectors, and in several other applications. The principal objectives here are to examine the viability of using these methods for STAP detectors, develop them into powerful analysis and design algorithms and, in the long term, use them for synthesizing novel detection structures. The adaptive matched filter (AMF) detector has been analyzed successfully using fast simulation. Of two biasing methods considered, one is implemented and shown to yield good results. The important problem of detector threshold determination is also addressed, with matching outcome. As an illustration of the power of these methods, two variants of the square-law AMF detector that are thought to be robust under heterogeneous clutter conditions have also been successfully investigated. These are the envelope-law and geometric-mean STAP detectors. Their CFAR property is established and performance evaluated. It turns out the variants have detection performances better than those of the AMF detector for training data contaminated by interferers. In summary, the work reported here paves the way for development of advanced estimation techniques that can facilitate design of powerful and robust detection algorithms", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "273", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "285", "date_publication": "January 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9457768", "date": "January 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "273 - 285", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Rajan Srinivasan", "Muralidhar Rangaswamy"], "keywords": ["error statistics", "importance sampling", "mean square error methods", "radar detection", "space-time adaptive processing", "adaptive importance sampling", "adaptive matched filter detector", "advanced estimation", "biasing methods", "constant false alarm rate", "detector threshold determination", "envelope-law STAP detectors", "false alarm probabilities", "fast simulation", "geometric-mean STAP detectors", "matching outcome", "radar detectors", "robust detection algorithms", "space-time adaptive processing", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Analytical models", "Clutter", "Envelope detectors", "Matched filters", "Monte Carlo methods", "Radar applications", "Radar detection", "Robustness", "Training data", ""], "arnumber": "4194771"}
