If the next pop-up threat locations could be predicted it would assist a search or attack team, such as in a persistent area denial (PAD) mission, in getting a team of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to the threats sooner. We present a Markov model for predicting pop-up ground threats in military operations. We first introduce a general Markov chain of order n to capture the dependence of the appearance of pop-up threats at previous locations of the pop-up threats over time. We then present an adaptive approach to estimate the stationary transition probabilities of the nth order Markov models. To choose the order of the Markov chain model for a specific application, we suggest using hypothesis tests from statistical inference on historical data of pop-up threat locations. Anticipating intelligent responses from an adversary, which might change its pop-up threat deployment strategy upon observing UAV movements, we present adaptive Markov chain models using a moving horizon approach to estimate possibly abrupt changes in transition probabilities. We combine predicted and actual pop-up target locations to develop efficient cooperative strategies for networked UAVs. A theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to evaluate the Markov model used for predicting pop-up threats. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of cooperative strategies using the combined information of threats and predicted threats in improving overall mission performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "509", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "521", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9677114", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "509 - 521", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yong Liu", "Jose B.
