Such frequency-shift keying (FSK) waveforms can be designed to have nearly ideal ambiguity function properties in both the time and frequency directions: the Costas property permits at most one coincident tone in autocorrelations in both time and frequency. Costas arrays are found by number-theoretic generators and their extensions, and by exhaustive search methods. Two new extensions of number-theoretic methods are introduced here that find two new Costas arrays. All Costas arrays for orders 24, 25, and 26 are disclosed here, including previously unknown examples.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "522", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "538", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9633731", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "522 - 538", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["James K.
