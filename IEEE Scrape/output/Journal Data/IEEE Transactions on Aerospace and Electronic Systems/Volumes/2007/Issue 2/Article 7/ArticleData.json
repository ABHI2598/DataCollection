In many cases, their scalar measurement channels can be assumed to be independent, with one-dimensional internal dynamics. The nominal operation of these systems can be severely damaged by faults in the sensors. A natural method that can be used to yield fault tolerant estimates of such systems is the interacting multiple model (IMM) filtering algorithm, which is known to provide very accurate results. However, having been derived for a general class of systems with switching parameters, the IMM filter does not utilize the independence of the measurement errors in different channels, nor does it exploit the fact that the process noise is of low intensity. Thus, the implementation of the IMM in this case is computationally expensive. A new estimation technique is proposed herein, that explicitly utilizes the aforementioned properties. In the resulting estimation scheme separate measurement channels are handled separately, thus reducing the computational complexity. It is shown that, whereas the IMM complexity is exponential in the number of fault-prone measurements, the complexity of the proposed technique is polynomial. A simulation study involving spacecraft attitude estimation is carried out. This study shows that the proposed technique closely approximates the full-blown IMM algorithm, while requiring only a modest fraction of the computational cost.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "492", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "508", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9656321", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "492 - 508", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ilia Rapoport", "Yaakov Oshman"], "keywords": ["attitude measurement", "fault tolerance", "filtering theory", "space vehicles", "IMM methodology", "computational complexity", "fault tolerant estimation", "interacting multiple model filtering algorithm", "one-dimensional internal dynamics", "scalar measurement channels", "spacecraft attitude estimation", "Computational complexity", "Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Filtering algorithms", "Filters", "Measurement errors", "Polynomials", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Sensor systems", "Yield estimation", ""], "arnumber": "4285349"}
