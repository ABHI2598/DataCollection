The suggested system uses a noise correlation technique to detect the presence and the direction of the target. Simulation and analytical results show an order of magnitude improvement in acquisition time of the radar when compared with a phased array antenna-based radar system with the same specifications, except transmit power. To the best knowledge of the authors, no radar of a comparable acquisition time has been designed to this date. Power versus acquisition time tradeoff has been compared with a phased array radar for evaluating performance of the system. The radar is self-tracking due to retrodirectivity of the antenna array, and is much easier to implement, as it does not require any phase shifters etc.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "472", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "479", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9692398", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "472 - 479", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Shalabh Gupta", "E.
