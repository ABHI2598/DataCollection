When the noise statistics information is unknown, the distributed information fusion estimators for the noise statistics parameters are presented based on the correlation functions and the weighting average approach. Further, a self-tuning information fusion multi-step predictor is obtained. It has a two-stage fusion structure. The first-stage fusion is to obtain the fused noise statistics information. The second-stage fusion is to obtain the fused multi-step predictor. A simulation example shows the effectiveness.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "418", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "427", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9656319", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "418 - 427", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Shuli Sun"], "keywords": ["Kalman filters", "correlation theory", "discrete systems", "linear systems", "matrix algebra", "sensor fusion", "stochastic systems", "correlated noises", "correlation functions", "discrete linear stochastic control systems", "distributed information fusion estimators", "distributed optimal information fusion", "linear minimum variance", "multiple sensors", "noise statistics information", "self-tuning information fusion", "steady-state Kalman multistep predictor", "two-stage fusion", "weighting average approach", "Control systems", "Gaussian distribution", "Kalman filters", "Sensor fusion", "Sensor systems", "State estimation", "Statistical distributions", "Steady-state", "Stochastic systems", "Yield estimation", ""], "arnumber": "4285343"}
