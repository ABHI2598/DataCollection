New apodization methods, such as spatially variant apodization (SVA), apply nonlinear filtering to the signal in order to completely remove sidelobes without any loss of resolution. However, the results are strongly influenced by signal sampling rate. Some variations which improve results have been previously published, but sidelobe cancellation gets worse since sampling frequency is not settled at Nyquist (or a multiple). This paper presents a new and efficient technique based on SVA that drastically reduces sidelobe levels for every sampling rate condition. The algorithm is, essentially, a parameter optimization of a variant filter for each pixel of the image. A one-dimensional case and a two-dimensional generalization are presented, as well as some applications to target detection capability in a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "571", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "580", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9686026", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "571 - 580", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Carlos Castillo-Rubio", "Sergio Llorente-Romano", "Mateo Burgos-Garcia"], "keywords": ["image resolution", "image sampling", "optimisation", "radar imaging", "synthetic aperture radar", "SAR system", "finite signal sampling rate condition", "image pixel", "nonlinear filtering", "robust SVA method", "sampling frequency", "sidelobe levels", "signal resolution", "spatially variant apodization", "synthetic aperture radar", "target detection capability", "two-dimensional generalization", "variant filter", "Filtering", "Filters", "Frequency", "Image sampling", "Pixel", "Robustness", "Sampling methods", "Signal resolution", "Signal sampling", "Spatial resolution", ""], "arnumber": "4285354"}
