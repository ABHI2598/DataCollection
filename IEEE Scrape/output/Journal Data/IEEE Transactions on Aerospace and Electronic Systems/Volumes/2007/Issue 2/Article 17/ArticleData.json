It was recently shown [1,2] that a random strategy exists in which the expected intercept time can be made arbitrarily close to linear as a function of the scan period of the radar. Can a deterministic strategy be devised in which a similar linear relationship exists for the maximum intercept time? By applying the celebrated arithmetic results of van der Waerden [3] and Szemeredi [4], we show that no such strategy is possible.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "645", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "650", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9692400", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "645 - 650", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["I.
