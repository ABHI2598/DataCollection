The neural network (NN) based adaptive critic controller presented the best choice for the flexibility and power necessary to accomplish the task, however no success guarantees can be made for the online training of neural weights for the unrestricted fault recovery problem. Built on the existing framework, we propose a novel supervisory system capable of detecting controller malfunctions before the stability of the plant is compromised. Furthermore, due to its ability to discern between controller malfunctions and faults within the plant, the proposed supervisor acts in a specific fashion in the event of a controller malfunction to provide new avenues with a greater probability of convergence using information from a dynamic model bank. The classification and distinction of controller malfunctions from the faults in the plant itself is achieved through an advanced decision logic based on three independent quality indexes. Proof-of-the-concept simulations over a nonlinear plant demonstrate the validity of the approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "706", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "722", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9686029", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "706 - 722", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Pedro G.
