The detection of a low elevation sea-surface target (LESST) is one example. For target tracking, this special case contrasts to the usual situation where we may often assume a constant probability of detection. Automatic target tracking requires a measure of track quality to discriminate between true and false tracks. This track quality measure should take both the existence of target and the SNR of the sensor into account, and be consistent with tracking performance. This paper investigates automatic target tracking using the integrated probabilistic data association (IPDA) type filters in the presence of multipath fading. Several existing single-scan probabilistic data association (PDA)-based filters, which calculate the probabilistic measure of track quality while estimating the track state, are evaluated in the scenario of tracking a nonmaneuvering LESST in the presence of both multipath fading and clutter. In addition, a variable Markov chain (VMC) IPDA tracker (IPDA-VMC), which has joint merits of both IPDA and the IPDA with a three state Markov chain (IPDA-M2), has been designed and evaluated here. In the derivation of track quality measure of both IPDA-M2 and 1PDA-VMC, the possibility that a target is present but is temporarily unable to be detected has been explicitly considered. A tracker using this track quality measure for false track discrimination has significantly improved LESST tracking performance. A simulation study verifies that both IPDA-M2 and IPDA-VMC have better capability to handle the LESST tracks and have an improved tracking performance over other PDA-based tracking algorithms under consideration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "759", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "774", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9692403", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "759 - 774", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Xuezhi Wang", "Darko Musicki"], "keywords": ["Markov processes", "filtering theory", "probability", "radar clutter", "radar detection", "radar signal processing", "radar tracking", "sensor fusion", "target tracking", "IPDA type filters", "automatic target tracking", "clutter", "detection probability", "integrated probabilistic data association", "low elevation sea-surface target tracking", "multipath fading", "multipath signal cancellation", "radar target tracking", "signal to noise ratio", "single-scan probabilistic data association", "track quality measure", "variable Markov chain", "Clutter", "Distortion measurement", "Fading", "Filters", "Phased arrays", "Radar detection", "Radar tracking", "Sea measurements", "Signal to noise ratio", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "4285369"}
