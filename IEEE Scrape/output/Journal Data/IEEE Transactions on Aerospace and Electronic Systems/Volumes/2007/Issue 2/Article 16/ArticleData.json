Though not originally designed with data broadcast capabilities, Loran's versatility has enabled data to be broadcast with great benefits. Research in the last two decades has resulted in a tremendous increase in the data capacity of Loran thereby increasing its utility. Currently, a modernized Loran is being evaluated for its capability to backup GPS and data modulation is an integral part of this Loran design. This paper details some recent Loran modulation designs and ideas.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "628", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "644", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9686028", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "628 - 644", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Sherman C.
