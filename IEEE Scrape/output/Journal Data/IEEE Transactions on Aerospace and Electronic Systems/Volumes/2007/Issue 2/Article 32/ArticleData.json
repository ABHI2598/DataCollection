Due to the geometric separation of the platforms, target statistics are modeled as independent from platform to platform but constant over the local data on a single platform. Clutter statistics are also assumed independent from platform to platform but have a local space-time correlation structure typical of monostatic space-time adaptive processing (STAP). Moreover, the target Doppler hypothesis varies from platform to platform due to multiple viewing perspectives. Previous published work has investigated the detection improvement obtained by multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) radar. This prior work, however, has only considered white noise. When clutter is considered, the diversity benefit of a MIMO or multistatic radar system is strongly dependent on geometry. We investigate the relationship between geometry and diversity gain for multistatic airborne space-time radar and the effects of this relationship on decentralized and centralized detection.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "806", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "813", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9692406", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "806 - 813", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Nathan A.
