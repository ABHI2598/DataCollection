Previous work has been performed which compares the detectability of bi-phase waveforms to a classic rectangular pulse. It is also of interest to compare the detectability of equal-bandwidth/equal-energy FMCW, quadriphase, and polyphase waveforms. The quadriphase waveform is the quadriphase version of the bi-phase Welti code. The polyphase waveforms are the PI, P2, P3, and P4 codes. Relative detection ranges are predicted using a simulation of the square-law, wideband crystal video, and channelized passive receivers possessing typical bandwidth, noise-floor, and loss parameters. A comparison is given showing the relative LPI/LPD attributes of each waveform and the relative detection attributes of each receiver.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "789", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "795", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9608077", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "789 - 795", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Frank B.
