The design of the modem is based on the cascaded integrator-comb (CIC) scheme which exploits a parallel processing so as to provide an outstanding decimation agility. Eventually, bit error rate (BER) performance of the multi-rate receiver are assessed by floating-point simulations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "826", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "832", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9633735", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "826 - 832", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["F.
