The first main contribution is that we combine two ideas introduced separately in the literature and propose a maneuver that offers improved imaging performance. We then formulate an optimal control problem to minimize fuel consumption and maximize image quality by minimizing the relative speed, which is proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the reconstructed image. We show that the necessary conditions are also sufficient and that the resulting optimal control is unique. Finally, we apply a continuation method to solve for the unique optimal trajectory.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "723", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "737", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9628281", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "723 - 737", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Islam I.
