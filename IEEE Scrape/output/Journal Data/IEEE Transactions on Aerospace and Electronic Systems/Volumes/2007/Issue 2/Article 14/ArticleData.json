It is proven that all signals are bounded for loss of control effectiveness failures during a bounded input disturbance. A state space approach is introduced for computing the feedforward compensator that is required by the stability result. The adaptive algorithm is applied to a three input model of the linearized lateral dynamics of the F/A-18 aircraft. Simulation results are obtained with single, double, and triple control effectiveness failures of 88% during the occurrence of a lateral gust. These results show that the adaptive controller exhibits improved model following as compared with a fixed gain eigenstructure assignment controller.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "600", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "611", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9608076", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "600 - 611", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Abderrazak I.
