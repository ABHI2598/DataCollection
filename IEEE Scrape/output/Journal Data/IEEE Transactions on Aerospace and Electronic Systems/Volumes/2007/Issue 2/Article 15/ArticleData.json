If the possibility of unresolved measurements is not modelled then it is quite likely that either the two tracks coalesce or that one of the two tracks diverges on false measurements. In literature a robust measurement resolution model has been incorporated within an interacting multiple model/multiple hypothesis tracking (IMM/MHT) track maintenance setting. A straightforward incorporation of the same model within an IMM and probabilistic data association (PDA)-like hypothesis merging approach suffers from track coalescence. In order to improve this situation, the paper develops a track-coalescence avoiding hypotheses merging version for the two target problem considered. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the novel filters are compared with applying hypotheses merging approaches that ignore the possibility of unresolved measurements or track-coalescence.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "612", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "627", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9633732", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "612 - 627", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Henk A.
