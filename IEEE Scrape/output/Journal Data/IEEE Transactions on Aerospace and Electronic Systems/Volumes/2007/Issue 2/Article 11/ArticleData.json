It propagates the PHD function, a first-order moment of the full multi-target posterior density. The peaks of the PHD function give estimates of target states. However, the PHD filter keeps no record of target identities and hence does not produce track-valued estimates of individual targets. We propose two different schemes according to which PHD filter can provide track-valued estimates of individual targets. Both schemes use the probabilistic data-association functionality albeit in different ways. In the first scheme, the outputs of the PHD filter are partitioned into tracks by performing track-to-estimate association. The second scheme uses the PHD filter as a clutter filter to eliminate some of the clutter from the measurement set before it is subjected to existing data association techniques. In both schemes, the PHD filter effectively reduces the size of the data that would be subject to data association. We consider the use of multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) for the purpose of data association. The performance of the proposed schemes are discussed and compared with that of MHT.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "556", "volume": "43", "lastpage": "570", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9692399", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "556 - 570", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kusha Panta", "Ba-ngu Vo", "Sumeetpal Singh"], "keywords": ["clutter", "estimation theory", "filtering theory", "probability", "sensor fusion", "target tracking", "tracking filters", "clutter filter", "data association schemes", "data association techniques", "finite set statistics", "multitarget posterior density", "optimal Bayesian multitarget filter", "probabilistic data-association functionality", "probability hypothesis density filter", "track-to-estimate association", "track-valued estimates", "Australia", "Bayesian methods", "Filters", "Information processing", "Performance evaluation", "Probability", "Random variables", "Statistics", "Target tracking", "Time measurement", ""], "arnumber": "4285353"}
