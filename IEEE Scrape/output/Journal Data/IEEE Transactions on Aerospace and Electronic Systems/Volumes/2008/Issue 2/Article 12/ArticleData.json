The cooperation must occur during real-time operation due to a need to repeatedly process each task, in spite of imperfect communications (e.g., messages with random but bounded delays), and the possibility that tasks \"pop-up.\" We show how to view this as a cooperative scheduling problem, and how to derive bounds on mission-level performance metrics. Simulations are used to compare the approach with a noncooperative strategy and to provide design guidelines for the cooperative scheduler.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "561", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "581", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090760", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "561 - 581", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Alvaro E.
