As land, sea/undersea, air, and space vehicles become more electric and less mechanical, vehicular industry is emerging as a leading application area for power electronics. Electrical architectures of power electronic based vehicular systems are in the form of multi-converter configurations. In multi-converter vehicular systems power electronic converters are mostly utilized in generating, distributing, and utilizing electrical energy in the vehicle. Power electronic converters, when tightly regulated, act as constant power loads. Constant power loads have a destabilizing effect on multi-converter systems. In order to mitigate this instability problem, which is also known as negative impedance instability, this paper introduces pulse adjustment, a novel digital control technique, to control DC/DC converters. This method applies predefined duty cycles, instead of conventional pulsewidth modulation (PWM) techniques, to regulate the output voltage. It is simple, cost-effective, and needs few logic gates and comparators to implement, thus, making it extremely simple and easy to develop using a low-cost application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Experimental results as well as simulation results are presented to describe and verify the proposed technique.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "766", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "782", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090771", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "766 - 782", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Alireza Khaligh", "Ali Emadi"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power converters", "application specific integrated circuits", "automotive electronics", "digital control", "electric vehicles", "power electronics", "DC/DC converters", "DCM/CCM pulse adjustment", "application-specific integrated circuit", "continuous conduction mode", "digital control", "discontinuous conduction mode", "electric vehicles", "multiconverter vehicular systems", "negative impedance instability", "power electronic converters", "Aerospace industry", "Application specific integrated circuits", "Electronics industry", "Fuel economy", "Impedance", "Power electronics", "Power generation", "Pulse width modulation", "Pulse width modulation converters", "Space vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "4560219"}
