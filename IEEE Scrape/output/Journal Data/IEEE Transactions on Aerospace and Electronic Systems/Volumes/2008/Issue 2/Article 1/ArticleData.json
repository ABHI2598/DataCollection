The novel aspects of the proposed IMM filter include the development of a constant axial force (CAF) Kalman filter, asymmetric IMM state interaction, and an entropy-based variation of the IMM mode probability update equation. Using data from a recent TBM defense (TBMD) test event, the proposed IMM filter is shown to yield consistent state estimates throughout the entire TBM trajectory, which includes a dual-stage boost during launch.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "418", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "426", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090749", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "418 - 426", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["William J.
