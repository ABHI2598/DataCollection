For the purpose of digital implementation, these continuous-time bang-bang control laws must be converted into digital control laws. The paper presents a novel technique for optimal digital implementation of a class of bang-bang control laws in linear systems. This technique delivers a discretization of the continuous-time laws and is shown: 1) to achieve the same cost as the optimal sample and hold (SH) approximation of the continuous-time laws, and 2) to be implementable (the optimal SH approximation is not). The cost-equivalencing technique is applied to the digital implementation of the continuous-time DGL/0, DGL/1, and DGL/C game theoretic guidance laws.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "643", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "654", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090765", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "643 - 654", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Dany Dionne", "Hannah Michalska"], "keywords": ["bang-bang control", "continuous time systems", "linear systems", "bang-bang control", "bang-bang guidance law", "continuous-time laws", "cost-equivalencing discretization", "digital control law", "linear system", "Actuators", "Bang-bang control", "Cost function", "Digital control", "Game theory", "Linear systems", "Machine intelligence", "Optimal control", "Research and development", "State feedback", ""], "arnumber": "4560212"}
