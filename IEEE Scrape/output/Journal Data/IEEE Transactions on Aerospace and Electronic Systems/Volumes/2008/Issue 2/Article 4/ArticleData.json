The estimator at every local sensor embeds the dynamics and the forgetting factor into the recursive least squares (RLS) method to remedy the lack of knowledge of noise statistics, developed before as the extended forgetting factor recursive least squares (EFRLS) estimator. It is proved that the two fusion methods are equivalent to the centralized EFRLS that uses all measurements from local sensors directly and their good performance is shown by simulation examples.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "457", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "467", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090752", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "457 - 467", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yunmin Zhu", "Keshu Zhang", "X.
