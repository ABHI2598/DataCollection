The mechanism of forces and moments generation is described and compared with other vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicles. A mathematical model of the body-forces generation process as well as the 6-DOF (degree of freedom) krotorcraft dynamics is presented. A stabilization algorithm is proposed which takes into account the input amplitude bounds as well as nonlinear couplings in the three-rotor dynamics. The performance of the control strategy is shown in real-time experiments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "783", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "794", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090772", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "783 - 794", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Sergio Salazar-Cruz", "Farid Kendoul", "Rogelio Lozano", "Isabelle Fantoni"], "keywords": ["helicopters", "real time systems", "remotely operated vehicles", "stability", "6 DOF krotorcraft dynamics", "VTOL vehicle", "body forces generation", "control algorithm", "fixed pitch propellers", "moments generation", "real-time stabilization algorithm", "small aerial vehicle", "three-rotor aircraft", "three-rotor dynamics", "vertical take-off and landing", "Aircraft navigation", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Couplings", "Helicopters", "Linear feedback control systems", "Military aircraft", "Rotors", "Sliding mode control", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", "Vehicle dynamics", ""], "arnumber": "4560220"}
