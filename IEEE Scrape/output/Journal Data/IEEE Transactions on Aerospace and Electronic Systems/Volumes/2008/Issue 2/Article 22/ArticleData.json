In a recent article [2] it was proposed to calculate the PCRLB conditional on the manoeuvre sequence and then determine the bound as a weighted average, giving an unconditional PCRLB. However, we demonstrate that this approach can produce an overly optimistic lower bound, because the sequence of manoeuvres is implicitly assumed known. Motivated by this, we develop a general approach and derive a closed-form estimate of the PCRLB in the case of Markovian switching systems. The basis of the approach is to, at each time step, replace the multi-modal prior target probability density function (pdf) with a best-fitting Gaussian (BFG) approximation. We present a recursive formula for calculating the mean and covariance of this Gaussian distribution, and demonstrate how the covariance increases as a result of the potential manoeuvres. We are then able to calculate the PCRLB for this BFG model using an existing Riccati-like recursion. Because of the BFG approximation, we are no longer guaranteed a bound and so we refer to our estimate as an \"error performance measure\" rather than a bound. The presented approach is applied both to filtering and smoothing cases. The simulation results indicate a very close agreement between the proposed performance measure and the error performance of an interacting multiple model estimator.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "724", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "747", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090769", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "724 - 747", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
