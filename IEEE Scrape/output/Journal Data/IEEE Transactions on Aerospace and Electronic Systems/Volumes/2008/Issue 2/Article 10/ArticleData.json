The effective load characteristics of various control methods in the solar array regulator system, such as the constant power load, variable power load, constant voltage load, constant current load, and constant resistive load, are classified to analyze the large-signal stability. Then, using the state plane analysis technique, the large-signal behavior of the solar array system is portrayed and the stability of various equilibrium points is analyzed. Thus, this approach can be contributed to organize the optimal controller structure of the system by representing the relationship between the control method of the solar array regulator and the large-signal stability. For the verification of the proposed large-signal analysis, a solar array regulator system that consists of two 100 W parallel module buck converters has been built and tested using a real 200 W solar array.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "538", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "547", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090758", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "538 - 547", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hyunsu Bae", "Jaeho Lee", "Sanghyun Park", "Bo Hyung Cho"], "keywords": ["optimal control", "power converters", "power generation control", "power system stability", "solar power stations", "constant current load", "constant power load", "constant resistive load", "constant voltage load", "large-signal stability analysis", "load characteristics", "low-earth-orbit satellite power system", "parallel module buck converters", "solar array power system", "solar array regulator system", "variable power load", "Buck converters", "Control systems", "Low earth orbit satellites", "Optimal control", "Performance analysis", "Power system analysis computing", "Power system stability", "Regulators", "Stability analysis", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "4560205"}
