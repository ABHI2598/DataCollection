We propose a hierarchical path planning algorithm (HIPLA) for real time path planning problems where the computational time is of critical significance. The main idea of HIPLA is to significantly reduce the search space for path computation by searching in a high-level abstraction graph, whose nodes are associated with precomputed risk estimates. The cumulative risk associated with all nodes along a path determines the quality of a path. We present a detailed experimental analysis of HIPLA by comparing it with two well-known approaches viz., shortest path algorithm (SPAH) [1] and Dijkstra's algorithm with pruning [2] for large node-weighted graphs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "427", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "440", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090750", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "427 - 440", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ramesh Rajagopalan", "Kishan G.
