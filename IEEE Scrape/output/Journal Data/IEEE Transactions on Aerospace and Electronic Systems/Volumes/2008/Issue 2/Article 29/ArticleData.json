The article summarizes the characteristics of typical indirect fire weapons. By tracking the launched projectile in flight, a Firefinder radar can accurately locate the weapon before the projectile impacts the ground and thereby allow timely counter fire to be placed on the weapon. The Firefinder radars have greatly reduced the effectiveness of indirect fire weapons and as a consequence saved many lives.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "817", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "829", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090775", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "817 - 829", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["William Fishbein"], "keywords": ["fires", "military radar", "projectiles", "radar detection", "radar tracking", "weapons", "Firefinder radar", "fire weapon location", "launched projectile tracking", "Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society", "Fires", "Mortar", "Projectiles", "Radar antennas", "Radar tracking", "Rockets", "Transmitting antennas", "Vehicles", "Weapons", ""], "arnumber": "4560225"}
