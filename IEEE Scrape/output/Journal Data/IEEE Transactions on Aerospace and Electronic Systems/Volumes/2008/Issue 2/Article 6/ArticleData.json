Typically, the discriminator manipulates several correlator outputs to form the correction signal. A multi-objective approach is adopted here to design the coefficients associated with a multi-correlator-based discriminator to lead to a better performance tradeoff in large tracking range, acceptable multipath-induced bias, high sensitivity, free of ambiguity, and small variance. It is shown that the multiple-objective problem can be tackled via a quadratic/linear programming method, rendering the optimal coefficient vector for the implementation of the discriminator. In addition, as the discriminator design is often subject to conflicting requirements, it is shown that the proposed design approach is capable of establishing bounds on achievable performance. Examples with respect to BPSK (binary phase-shift keying) NRZ (nonreturn-to-zero), and BOC (binary-offset carrier) signals are given to illustrate the design approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "481", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "492", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090754", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "481 - 492", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jyh-Ching Juang"], "keywords": ["correlators", "linear programming", "quadratic programming", "radio receivers", "satellite navigation", "satellite tracking", "spread spectrum communication", "BOC", "BPSK", "GNSS code discriminator", "GNSS receivers", "Global Navigation Satellite System", "binary phase-shift keying", "binary-offset carrier", "code tracking loop", "multicorrelator-based discriminator", "multipath-induced bias", "quadratic/linear programming", "spread spectrum ranging system", "Binary phase shift keying", "Correlators", "Global Positioning System", "Linear programming", "Optical signal processing", "Phase shift keying", "Satellite navigation systems", "Spread spectrum communication", "Tracking loops", "Vectors", ""], "arnumber": "4560201"}
