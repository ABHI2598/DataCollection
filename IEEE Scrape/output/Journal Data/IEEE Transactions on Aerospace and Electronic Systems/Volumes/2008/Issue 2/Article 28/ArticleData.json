But MIL-STD-883E gives some test conditions which are not always appropriate. The test conditions of PIND are derived here based on dynamics. The upper limit frequency expression is obtained by a transforming equation. How vibration acceleration, vibration frequency, recovery coefficient, particle mass, and cavity height influence the particle's output energy is discussed. Moreover, the applicable range of test conditions of MIL-STD-883E are indicated and the best vibration frequency is derived by analyzing the relationship between the output power of vibrator and the particle's output energy. Some experiments are given.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "808", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "814", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10103188", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "808 - 814", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hui Zhang", "Shu-Juan Wang", "Guo-Fu Zhai"], "keywords": ["acoustic noise measurement", "dynamic testing", "electronic equipment testing", "measurement standards", "military standards", "cavity height influence", "particle impact noise detection standards", "particle mass", "recovery coefficients", "screening technique", "upper limit frequency expression", "vibration acceleration", "vibration frequency", "Acceleration", "Aerodynamics", "Contamination", "Electronic components", "Electronic equipment testing", "Frequency", "Life estimation", "Manufacturing", "Vehicle dynamics", "Vibrations", ""], "arnumber": "4560223"}
