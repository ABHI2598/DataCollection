The methodologies employ classical optimization techniques to iteratively determine both the transponder gain of each subchannel and the transmit powers of the participating terminals. Given the transponder behavior with nonhomogeneous gain state, interference, and intermodulation (IM), efficient loading algorithms are devised to solve the optimal subchannel gains and link transmission powers based on the developed analytical methods. The optimal satellite loading can be achieved in a finite number of iterations to minimize the combined satellite and terminals powers simultaneously and to close involved links. A practical example in computing the optimum gains and transmission powers is also presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "795", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "801", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090773", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "795 - 801", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kenneth Y.
