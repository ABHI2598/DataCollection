The proposed scheme is implemented using a constructive neural network (cascade-correlation network (CCNs)) to overcome the limitations of conventional techniques that are predominantly based on the Kalman filter (KF). The CNN applied in this research has the advantage of having a flexible topology if compared with the recently utilized multi-layer feed-forward neural networks (MFNNs) for inertial navigation system (INS)/GPS integration. The preliminary results presented in this article illustrate the effectiveness of proposed CCNs over both MFNN-based and Kalman filtering techniques for INS/GPS integration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "582", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "594", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090761", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "582 - 594", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kai-wei Chiang", "Aboelmagd Noureldin", "Naser El-Sheimy"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "Kalman filters", "feedforward neural nets", "inertial navigation", "micromechanical devices", "Kalman filter", "MEMS-GPS integration scheme", "cascade-correlation network", "constructive neural-networks", "global positioning system", "inertial navigation system", "low-cost micro-electro-mechanical systems inertial measurements units", "multi-layer feed-forward neural networks", "Cellular neural networks", "Feedforward neural networks", "Feedforward systems", "Global Positioning System", "Measurement units", "Microelectromechanical systems", "Micromechanical devices", "Multi-layer neural network", "Network topology", "Neural networks", ""], "arnumber": "4560208"}
