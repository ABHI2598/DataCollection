The pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) representation was used to formulate a reduced-complexity detector whose performance is within 0.7 dB of maximum likelihood detection and 5.6 dB better than limiter-discriminator detection in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) environment. The complexity of the reduced-complexity detector is less than 25% that of the maximum likelihood detector but, unlike the limiter-discriminator detector, requires a carrier phase PLL. In the presence of phase noise, the reduced-complexity detector outperforms limiter-discriminator detection when the RMS frequency deviation due to phase noise is less than 10% of the bit rate.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "468", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "480", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10090753", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "468 - 480", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Mason Wardle", "Michael Rice"], "keywords": ["AWGN", "aircraft communication", "computational complexity", "continuous phase modulation", "maximum likelihood estimation", "phase noise", "pulse amplitude modulation", "radio receivers", "AWGN", "RMS frequency deviation", "additive white Gaussian noise", "carrier phase PLL", "enhanced flight termination system", "flight termination receivers", "limiter-discriminator detection", "maximum likelihood detection", "maximum likelihood detector", "phase noise", "pulse-amplitude modulation", "reduced-complexity detector", "weak continuous phase modulation", "AWGN", "Additive white noise", "Bit rate", "Continuous phase modulation", "Maximum likelihood detection", "Phase detection", "Phase frequency detector", "Phase locked loops", "Phase noise", "Pulse modulation", ""], "arnumber": "4560200"}
