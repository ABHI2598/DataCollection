Simplifying converter models is necessary to improve simulation execution times, however many existing techniques do not necessarily give accurate results for all types of system level studies. This paper describes an alternative modelling approach to these, which provides accurate results and reduced simulation times for studies of electrical fault analyses.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "99", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "110", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943757", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "99 - 110", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
