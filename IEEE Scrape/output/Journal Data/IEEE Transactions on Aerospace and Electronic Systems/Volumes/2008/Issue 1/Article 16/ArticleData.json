The high line frequency of airborne AC power systems presents a major challenge for the design of PFC converters capable of meeting these standards. This paper investigates a new source of harmonic current distortion and the resulting system power quality problems related to dynamic interactions between PFC converters and the AC source. Experimental results are first presented to demonstrate the existence of such interactions and their effects on system power quality. Analytical and numerical simulation results are then presented to explain why such dynamic interactions can lead to significantly increased harmonic current distortion in steady state operation. Elimination of undesirable system interactions through proper damping of the PFC converter input filter is also presented and its effectiveness experimentally validated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "217", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "226", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943765", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "217 - 226", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jian Sun", "Min Chen", "Kamiar J.
