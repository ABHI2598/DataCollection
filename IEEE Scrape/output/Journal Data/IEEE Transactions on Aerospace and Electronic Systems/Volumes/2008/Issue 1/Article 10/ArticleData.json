This empirical bound is developed using historical meteorological data collected at a set of geographically diverse locations over a thirty year period. The confidence bound developed is shown to provide a Gaussian overbound on altimeter altitude errors in standard atmospheric conditions between a 10-5 and 10-6 confidence level. This confidence bound is integrated into the standard methodology for analyzing the performance of GPS-based landing systems and the results of a performance trade study using the confidence bound are presented. The results show that incorporating the empirical barometric altimeter confidence bound provides an increase in the coterminous United States (CONUS) service volume for lateral precision with vertical guidance (LPV) type approaches. While this increase is approximately 2% for an L1 single-frequency GPS user, it jumps to roughly 40% for an L5 single-frequency user.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "127", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "146", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943759", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "127 - 146", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Shau-shiun Jan", "Demoz Gebre-Egziabher", "Todd Walter", "Per Enge"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "altimeters", "barometers", "meteorological radar", "GPS-based landing system performance", "coterminous United States", "empirical barometric altimeter confidence bound", "lateral precision with vertical guidance approach", "meteorological data collection", "standard atmospheric conditions", "Aircraft navigation", "Availability", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "FAA", "Global Positioning System", "Meteorology", "Phase measurement", "Satellite navigation systems", "Sensor systems", "System performance", ""], "arnumber": "4516994"}
