These systems are designed to detect small targets at long range and they often employ track-before-detect (TBD) strategies to integrate the target signal along consecutive frames. Jitter causes frame misalignment and leads to a reduction of the detection performance. We analyze the effects of jitter on the false alarm and detection probabilities and on the detection range. The analytical expressions here derived are a valuable tool both in the analysis and synthesis of IRST systems based on 3-D velocity filters.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "326", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "338", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943772", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "326 - 338", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["N.
