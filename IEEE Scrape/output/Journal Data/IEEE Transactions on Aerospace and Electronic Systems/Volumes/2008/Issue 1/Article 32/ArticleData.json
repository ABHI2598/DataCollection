It is well known that the state estimates obtained from a Kalman filter have correlated errors in time. While the innovations are white, this does not carry over to the state estimation errors. It should also be pointed out that the use of a sliding window for track-to-track association with the (appropriate) caveat that the distribution of the sum of chi-square variables over the window is only approximately chi-square distributed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "396", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "396", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943781", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "396", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Y.
