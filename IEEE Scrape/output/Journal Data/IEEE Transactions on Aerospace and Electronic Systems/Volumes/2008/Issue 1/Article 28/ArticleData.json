A representative target consisting of two combined electric and magnetic dipoles with arbitrary orientation is presented to formulate angular glint linear deviations when the polarizations of the scattered waves and the receiving antenna are considered. Analysis shows that the equivalence between phase gradient method and Poynting vector method exists when geometrical optics approximation is used and the receiving antenna is linearly polarized.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "372", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "380", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943777", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "372 - 380", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hong Cheng Yin", "Pei Kang Huang"], "keywords": ["dipole antennas", "magnetic moments", "polarization", "radar antennas", "radar tracking", "receiving antennas", "target tracking", "Poynting vector method", "electric dipoles", "magnetic dipoles", "phase gradient method", "polarizations", "radar target angular glint", "receiving antenna", "scattered waves", "Dipole antennas", "Geometrical optics", "Gradient methods", "Magnetic analysis", "Optical polarization", "Optical scattering", "Radar antennas", "Radar scattering", "Receiving antennas", "Vectors", ""], "arnumber": "4517012"}
