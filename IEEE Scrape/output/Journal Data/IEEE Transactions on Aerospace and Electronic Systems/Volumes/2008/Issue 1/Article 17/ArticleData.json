In this paper, we consider fault detection in dynamic systems monitored by multiple sensors. Normal and faulty behaviors can be modeled as two hypotheses. Due to communication constraints, it is assumed that sensors can only send binary data to the fusion center. Under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (1ID) observations, we propose a distributed fault detection algorithm, including local detector design and decision fusion rule design, based on state estimation via particle filtering. Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "227", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "242", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943766", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "227 - 242", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Qi Cheng", "Pramod K.
