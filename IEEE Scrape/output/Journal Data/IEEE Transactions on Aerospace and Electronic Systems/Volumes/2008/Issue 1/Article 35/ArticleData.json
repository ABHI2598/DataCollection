A full scale model of MiG-29 aircraft is considered for discrimination against another with stores (missiles) attached below the wings. The MiG-29 aircraft is impinged with a radar impulse to excite the electrical natural resonance frequencies of the aircraft. These natural resonance frequencies are unique to any aircraft and are used as distinct features for discriminating it against another MiG-29 aircraft with stores. Prony's method is used to extract the natural frequencies from the impulse response of the aircraft.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "408", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "416", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943784", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "408 - 416", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["K.
