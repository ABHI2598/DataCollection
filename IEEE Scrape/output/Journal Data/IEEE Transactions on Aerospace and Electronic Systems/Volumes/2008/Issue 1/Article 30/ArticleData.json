This method is well suited for linear uniform motion as well as for nonuniform motion that may be caused by ocean waves. The key step is a modified adaptive notch filter (ANF) that can retrieve phase modulation due to motion. Simulation examples and real SAR results are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "384", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "392", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943779", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "384 - 392", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Marina V.
