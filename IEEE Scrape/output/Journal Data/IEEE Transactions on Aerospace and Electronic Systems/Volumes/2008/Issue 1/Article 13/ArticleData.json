Here we propose the use of multiple signals with arbitrary cross-correlation matrix R, and show that R can be chosen to achieve or approximate a desired spatial transmit beampattern. Two specific problems are addressed. The first is the constrained optimization problem of finding the value of R which causes the true transmit beampattern to be close in some sense to a desired beampattern. This is approached using convex optimization techniques. The second is the problem of designing multiple constant-modulus waveforms with given cross-correlation R. The use of coded binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) waveforms is considered. A method for finding the code sequences based on random signaling with a structured correlation matrix is proposed. It is also shown that by restricting the class of admissible waveforms one reduces the set of possible signal correlation matrices.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "171", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "186", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943762", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "171 - 186", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Daniel R.
