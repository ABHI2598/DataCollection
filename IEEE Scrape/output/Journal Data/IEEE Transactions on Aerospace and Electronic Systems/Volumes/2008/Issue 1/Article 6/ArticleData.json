The guidance law is derived by analyzing an interception scenario in the framework of an linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) terminal control problem with bounded acceleration command. The nonlinear saturation function is represented by the equivalent random input describing function. Since for the investigated problem the certainty equivalence property is not valid, the resulting controller depends on the measurement noise level and on the saturation limit. In comparison to the classical optimal guidance law (OGL), the maximal value of the effective navigation gain is achieved during the engagement instead of near the terminal time. Thus, the saturation limit is reached earlier so as to have enough time to reduce the guidance errors. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, the superiority of the new guidance law over the classical OGL is shown. This validates the new approach of designing an estimation statistics dependent guidance law by using a random input describing function to approximate the missile's acceleration saturation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "77", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "86", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943755", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "77 - 86", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Gyorgy Hexner", "Tal Shima", "Haim Weiss"], "keywords": ["Gaussian processes", "Monte Carlo methods", "linear quadratic control", "missile guidance", "Monte-Carlo simulations", "bounded acceleration command", "equivalence property", "equivalent random input describing function", "guidance law", "interception scenario", "linear quadratic Gaussian terminal control problem", "measurement noise level", "missile acceleration saturation", "missile guidance law", "nonlinear saturation function", "optimal guidance law", "probability density function", "Acceleration", "Aerodynamics", "Missiles", "Navigation", "Noise level", "Noise measurement", "Optimal control", "Probability density function", "State estimation", "Statistics", ""], "arnumber": "4516990"}
