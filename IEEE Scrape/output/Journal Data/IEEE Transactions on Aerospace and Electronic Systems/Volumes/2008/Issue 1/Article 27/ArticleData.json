In the direct implementation, the formulation of the time-scaling chaotic signal takes much computational load and its accuracy determines the quality of the calculated AF diagrams. By exploring the generation of the chaotic signal, the impulsive synchronization theory can be used to produce its time-delay and time-scaling versions. With this observation, the AF diagrams can be accurately obtained by following correlation operation. A distinct characteristic of the proposed scheme is that the generation of the time-delay and time-scaling versions is implemented in an analog way, while the correlation operation can be implemented in a digital way. This mixed analog-digital structure provides the proposed scheme with implementation advantages and practical applicability.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "367", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "372", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943776", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "367 - 372", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Wen Hu", "Zhong Liu", "Chunbiao Li"], "keywords": ["chaos", "nonlinear dynamical systems", "synchronization", "AF", "ambiguity function", "analog-digital structure", "synchronization", "time-delay", "time-scaling chaotic signal", "wideband chaotic signals", "Analog-digital conversion", "Chaos", "Character generation", "Circuits and systems", "Correlation", "Delay estimation", "Doppler radar", "Signal generators", "Signal processing", "Wideband", ""], "arnumber": "4517011"}
