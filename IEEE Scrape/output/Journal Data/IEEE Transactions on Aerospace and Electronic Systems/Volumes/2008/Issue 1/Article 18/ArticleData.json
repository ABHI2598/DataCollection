This paper focuses on an estimation algorithm that incorporates two basic computer-vision measurement types: a landmark table (LMT) and a paired feature table (PFT). Several innovations are developed to incorporate these measurement types into the on-board state estimation algorithm. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "243", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "260", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943767", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "243 - 260", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["David S.
