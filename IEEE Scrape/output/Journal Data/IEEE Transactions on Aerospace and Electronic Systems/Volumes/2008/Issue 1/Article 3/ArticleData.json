It is shown that the Hatch gain generates white residual sequence in both the RD and the PD. An experiment result demonstrates that the proposed PD Hatch filter is advantageous in real-time kinematic positioning.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "January 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "9943752", "date": "January 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "30 - 40", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["H.
