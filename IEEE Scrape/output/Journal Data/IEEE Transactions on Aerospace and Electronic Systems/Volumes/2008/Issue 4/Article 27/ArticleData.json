Several existing methods for narrowband DOA estimation are extended to resolve multiple closely spaced sources in presence of interference and wind noise. New wideband Capon beamforming methods are developed that use various algorithms for combining the power spectra at different frequency bins. A robust wideband Capon method is also studied to account for the inherent uncertainties in the array steering vector. Finally, to improve the resolution within an angular sector of interest and to provide robustness to sensor data loss, the beamspace method is extended and applied to the wideband problems. These methods are then tested and benchmarked on two real acoustic signature data sets that contain multiple ground vehicles moving in various formations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1585", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1599", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476209", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1585 - 1599", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Mahmood R.
