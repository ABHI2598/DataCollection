Empirical results from a transport helicopter are presented to illustrate the technique. Of particular note, the instance of multipath fading more severe than Rayleigh was found to be greater than 20% in ISM bands of interest, thereby motivating future work in diversity schemes appropriate for this application space.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1609", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1615", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476211", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1609 - 1615", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Richard Ketcham", "Jeff Frolik", "John Covell"], "keywords": ["avionics", "helicopters", "wireless sensor networks", "Rayleigh", "helicopters", "multipath fading", "propagation measurement", "small scale propagation characteristics", "statistical modeling", "wireless sensor systems", "Aircraft", "Communication system security", "Frequency", "Helicopters", "Polarization", "Rayleigh channels", "Sensor systems", "Space technology", "Wireless sensor networks", "Wiring", ""], "arnumber": "4667735"}
