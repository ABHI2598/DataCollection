For ideal single bin processing, it was shown in the literature that at most two unresolved targets can be extracted from the complex matched filter output signal. A new algorithm is developed to jointly detect and track more than two unresolved targets from a single detection with the help of tracking information. That is, the method involves the use of tracking information in the detection process. For this purpose, target states are transformed into detection parameter space, which involves high nonlinearities. In order to handle the nonlinearities, the particle filter, which has proven to be effective in nonlinear non-Gaussian estimation problems, is used as the basis of the closed loop system for tracking multiple unresolved targets. In addition to the standard particle filtering steps, the detection parameters corresponding to the predicted particles are evaluated using the nonlinear monopulse radar beam model. This in turn enables the evaluation of the likelihood of the monopulse signal given tracking data. Bayesian model selection is then used to find the correct detection event. The corresponding particle set is taken as the correct representation of the target posterior. A simulated amplitude comparison monopulse radar is used to generate the data and validate the joint detection and tracking of more than two unresolved targets.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1326", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1341", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476192", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1326 - 1341", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["N.
