A new set of Klobuchar-Self coefficients can be estimated using the method. Primary results demonstrate that the refined Klobuchar-Self coefficients developed may provide better ionospheric delay corrections for single-frequency GPS receivers and improve standard single point positioning accuracies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1498", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1510", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476202", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1498 - 1510", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yunbin Yuan", "Xingliang Huo", "Jikun Ou", "Kefei Zhang", "Yanju Chai", "Debao Wen", "Ron Grenfell"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "Crust Movement Observation Network of China", "GPS broadcast ionospheric time-delay correction accuracy", "GPS observation data", "Global Positioning System", "Klobuchar ionospheric coefficients", "Klobuchar-Self coefficients", "international GNSS service observation stations", "ionospheric delay corrections", "single-frequency GPS receivers", "standard single point positioning accuracies", "Broadcasting", "Degradation", "Delay effects", "Error correction", "FAA", "Geodesy", "Global Positioning System", "Mathematical model", "Satellite navigation systems", "Standards development", ""], "arnumber": "4667725"}
