By fusing multiple single-cycle estimators, a novel method referred to as multicycle estimator is proposed which can overcome the disadvantages that single-cycle estimator has. Performance analyses of the proposed algorithm are also carried out. The performances of different estimators in various environments are tested in numerical simulations. Simulation results indicate that the newly proposed algorithm outperforms the single-cycle estimator and conventional cross-correlation method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1251", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1264", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476189", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1251 - 1264", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Huang Zhitao", "Zhou Yiyu", "Jiang Wenli"], "keywords": ["Doppler shift", "correlation methods", "time-of-arrival estimation", "Doppler estimation", "TDOA estimation", "cross-correlation method", "cyclostationary signals", "multicycle estimator", "multiple cycle frequencies", "Doppler shift", "Frequency estimation", "Interference", "Numerical simulation", "Performance analysis", "Performance evaluation", "Signal analysis", "Telemetry", "Testing", "Time difference of arrival", ""], "arnumber": "4667707"}
