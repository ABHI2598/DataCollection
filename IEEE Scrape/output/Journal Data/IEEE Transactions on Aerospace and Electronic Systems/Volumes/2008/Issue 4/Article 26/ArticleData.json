When implementing the FFT algorithm on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms, the primary goal is to maximize throughput and minimize area. Feedback and feedforward architectures have been analyzed regarding key design parameters: radix, bitwidth, number of points and stage scaling. Moreover, a simplification of the FFT algorithm, the monobit FFT, has been implemented in order to achieve faster real time performance in broadband digital receivers. The influence of the hardware implementation on the performance of digital channelized receivers has been analyzed in depth, revealing interesting implementation trade-offs which should be taken into account when designing this kind of signal processing systems on FPGA platforms.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1567", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1585", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476208", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1567 - 1585", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Miguel A.
