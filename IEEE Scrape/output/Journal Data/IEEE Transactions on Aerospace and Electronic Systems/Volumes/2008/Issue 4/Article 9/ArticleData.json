Active sonar can be categorized into monostatic, bistatic, and multistatic, depending on the number of receiver elements. Target localization performance depends on the system configuration. The target localization performance of the monostatic, bistatic, and multistatic sonar systems is compared assuming that each element can receive both range and azimuth information of the target. In addition, we propose the weighted least square (WLS) algorithm, which incorporates judicial weighting to the conventional least square (LS) method, and an efficient sensor arrangement rule for target localization in the multistatic sonar system. The representative experimental results demonstrate that the target localization performance of multistatic sonar configuration is superior in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE), to monostatic sonar and bistatic sonar by 35.98% and 37.45%, respectively, while the proposed WLS algorithm showed an improvement of 2.27% compared with the LS method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1371", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1380", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476195", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1371 - 1380", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Suhwan Kim", "Bonhwa Ku", "Wooyoung Hong", "Hanseok Ko"], "keywords": ["least mean squares methods", "sonar tracking", "target tracking", "active sonar systems", "fusion algorithms", "multistatic sonar", "root-mean-square error method", "target localization", "weighted least square algorithm", "Array signal processing", "Azimuth", "Iterative methods", "Least squares methods", "Noise measurement", "Sensor systems", "Sonar measurements", "Time measurement", "Transmitters", "Underwater acoustics", ""], "arnumber": "4667715"}
