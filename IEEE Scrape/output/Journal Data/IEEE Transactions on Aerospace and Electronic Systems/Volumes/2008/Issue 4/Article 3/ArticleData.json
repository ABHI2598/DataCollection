On-board axial detection is more complex than the classic ground-based tangential approach, because the axial air speed in vortices is low and the atmospheric particle density is reduced, yielding a poorer SNR. To provide meaningful results in such unfavorable conditions we have developed a new flexible signal processing method based on a two-primitive model fitting the spectrum of the Doppler return. This new spectral estimation successfully detects wake vortices with an admissible SNR that is lower than other on-board state-of-the-art approaches. It was validated through flight tests.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1276", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1290", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10479150", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1276 - 1290", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Damien Douxchamps", "S\u00e9bastien Lugan", "Yannick Verschueren", "Laurence Mutuel", "Beno\u00eet Macq", "Kunihiro Chihara"], "keywords": ["Doppler radar", "aerospace testing", "airborne radar", "infrared detectors", "optical radar", "optical signal detection", "radar detection", "spectral analysis", "vortices", "wakes", "atmospheric particle density", "axial air speed", "flexible signal processing method", "flight tests", "infrared pulsed Doppler LiDAR", "light detection-and-ranging system", "on-board axial detection", "size 2 mum", "spectral estimation", "two-primitive model fitting", "wake vortice detection", "Aerospace electronics", "Air traffic control", "Aircraft", "Airports", "FAA", "Face detection", "Hazards", "Infrared detectors", "Laser radar", "Throughput", ""], "arnumber": "4667709"}
