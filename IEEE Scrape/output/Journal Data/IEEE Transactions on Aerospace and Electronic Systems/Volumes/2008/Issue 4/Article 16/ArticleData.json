When wind farms are located close to radionavigation systems, it becomes important to evaluate their electromagnetic effects on existing radionavigation instalations. In this study, the radionavigation system is a VOR (VHF omnidirectional radio) operating at about 110 MHz. Because rotor blades are made of a balsa and dielectric multilayers composition, their electromagnetic behavior differs from that of metal blades at VHF frequences. In this study, we first obtain an electromagnetic CAD model from a real structural design; then we calculate the far field scattering matrix from an integral method (CESC code [1] method of moment) for a (30 m) dielectric blade and compare it with a metal one using RCS (radar cross section) calculation. The impact of (40 m long) dielectric blades is compared with the (65 m high) metal mast effect in terms of scattered field, and then the VOR error (bearing error) is evaluated. These results are analyzed for several geometrical configurations of a three-bladed rotor and compared with the mast. The study is extended on wind farms to discuss geometrical configuration effects with regard to a VOR location.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1464", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1476", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476200", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1464 - 1476", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
