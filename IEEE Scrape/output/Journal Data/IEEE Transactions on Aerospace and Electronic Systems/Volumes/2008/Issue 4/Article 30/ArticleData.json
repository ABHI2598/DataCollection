A multistatic version of the adaptive matched filter (AMF) detector is also developed and its performance results compared with that of the GLRT. Results show that the multistatic GLRT outperforms the multistatic AMF and that the performance advantage increases with the number of radars in the system. The concepts of geometry gain and diversity gain for multistatic STAP are defined in terms of asymptotic properties of the system's probability of miss.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1615", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1623", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476212", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1615 - 1623", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Donald P.
