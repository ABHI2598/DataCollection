We briefly describe the concept of the UAV pseudolite system, which can be used as a GPS augmentation system or a local navigation system. Because the motion of UAVs is very variable, a special format is necessary for UAV navigation messages. Our approach is based on specialized message formats for each motion of the UAV, including both line and circle tracking, and the separation of nominal values and deviations. It can reduce the total size of the message and diminish the latency problem. The space saved by the smaller messages can be used for the other useful messages. To verify the proposed message format, we analyzed logged data from UAV flight tests. Although the UAV we used is an experimental vehicle with a limited control system using a single antenna GPS receiver, the overall performance was consistent with current satellite-based systems. The proposed message formats and the related design method will be capable of extension for an airship-based system or a balloon-based system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1342", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1355", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476193", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1342 - 1355", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Doyoon Kim", "Byungwoon Park", "Sanghyo Lee", "Am Cho", "Jihoon Kim", "Changdon Kee"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "aerospace instrumentation", "aircraft navigation", "radio receivers", "remotely operated vehicles", "GPS augmentation system", "GPS receiver", "UAV flight tests", "UAV pseudolite navigation system", "airborne pseudolite navigation system", "airship-based system", "balloon-based system", "circle tracking", "line tracking", "local navigation system", "navigation message format", "unmanned aerial vehicle", "Control systems", "Data analysis", "Delay", "Design methodology", "Global Positioning System", "Navigation", "Receiving antennas", "Testing", "Tracking", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "4667713"}
