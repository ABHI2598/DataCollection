A PFA completely free of interpolation has been achieved in moderate squinted imaging geometry. The presented approach consists of the range and azimuth scaling of the polar samples, in which only fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and complex vector multiplications are involved. Following different processing chains, the dechirped and the chirped SAR signals are treated separately in this paper. Relative to the classic polyphase filter that uses the long sinc kernel, the new solution is able to attain a comparable result, but is much quicker by exploiting inherent properties of the linear frequency modulated (LFM) signal. Point target simulation has validated the presented methodology.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1433", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1448", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476198", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1433 - 1448", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Daiyin Zhu", "Shaohua Ye", "Zhaoda Zhu"], "keywords": ["radar imaging", "synthetic aperture radar", "azimuth scaling", "chirp scaling", "complex vector multiplications", "fast Fourier transforms", "linear frequency modulation", "point target simulation", "polar format algorithm", "polyphase filter", "range scaling", "spotlight SAR image formation", "synthetic aperture radar", "Azimuth", "Chirp modulation", "Fast Fourier transforms", "Flexible printed circuits", "Geometry", "Interpolation", "Nonlinear filters", "Personal communication networks", "Signal processing", "Synthetic aperture radar", ""], "arnumber": "4667720"}
