The proposed guidance law can solve the impact angle control problem for virtually every initial geometry of pursuer and target on a plane and any desired impact attitude angle. The impact angle error of the proposed law is presented in a closed form. In addition it is shown that the acceleration command is finite even at impact time. A comparative study with existing techniques is performed both analytically and numerically to investigate the performance and properties of the new law.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1449", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1463", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476199", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1449 - 1463", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Myung-Gon Yoon"], "keywords": ["aircraft control", "aircraft navigation", "attitude control", "linear programming", "quadratic programming", "suboptimal control", "acceleration command", "aircraft navigation", "homing navigation guidance law", "impact angle control problem", "linear quadratic optimization technique", "moving target", "relative circular navigation guidance", "suboptimal guidance law", "Acceleration", "Attitude control", "Costs", "Geometry", "Mechanical engineering", "Missiles", "Navigation", "Performance analysis", "Performance gain", "Velocity control", ""], "arnumber": "4667721"}
