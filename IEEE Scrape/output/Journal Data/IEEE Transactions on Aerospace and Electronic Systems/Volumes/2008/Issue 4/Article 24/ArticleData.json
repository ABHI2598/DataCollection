The search function is obtained for different hemispherical regions based on the number of active/nonactive array faces. We derive the surveillance occupancy functions for a typical scenario consisting of 4 search sectors under various constraints and consider the number of radiating elements required for surveillance purposes. We derive an expression for the accurate determination of the surveillance volume and average beam dwell times for different scan angles based on the theory of manifolds and consider the impact of various window functions on the broadside dwell times.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1551", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1559", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10476207", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1551 - 1559", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
