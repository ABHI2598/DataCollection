This paper presents a multi-agent system for simulating the impact of individual human factors on aircraft evacuations. Based on the model, a prototype system, AvatarSim, was developed to simulate emergency evacuations from aircrafts. The simulator can be used to model situations that are difficult to test in real-life due to safety considerations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1477", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1488", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10479153", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1477 - 1488", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Sharad Sharma", "Harpreet Singh", "Atul Prakash"], "keywords": ["human factors", "humanities", "multi-agent systems", "AvatarSim", "aircraft evacuations", "collective behavior", "emergency evacuations", "human behavior", "multi-agent modeling", "multi-agent system", "Aircraft manufacture", "Certification", "Computational modeling", "FAA", "Fuzzy logic", "Human factors", "Safety", "Stress", "Testing", "Uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "4667723"}
