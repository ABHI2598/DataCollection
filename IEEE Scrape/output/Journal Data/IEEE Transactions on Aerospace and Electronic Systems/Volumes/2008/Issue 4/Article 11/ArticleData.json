The camera was operated by an algorithm that automatically tracked the detected target, and the location was obtained using triangulation. The algorithm, however, suffers from a bias in target localization, because the aircraft Euler angles are not measured directly, but rather inferred from GPS velocity. To enhance the algorithm, the influence of the wind was taken into consideration to improve the localization accuracy, which cannot be deduced using a single-antenna GPS. Using a special maneuver, the circular level flight, wind velocity was estimated by the periodic variation of the aircraft's velocity and angle of attack (AOA) using the camera angles. Then, the pseudopitch angle was compensated for using the estimated results. The experimental data show that applying the pitch angle calibration successfully eliminated almost 90% of the horizontal localization error and the final 3D accuracy was less than 10 m.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1391", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1401", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10479152", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "1391 - 1401", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Subong Sohn", "Bhoram Lee", "Jihoon Kim", "Changdon Kee"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "aircraft control", "real-time systems", "remotely operated vehicles", "robot vision", "target tracking", "aircraft Euler angles", "angle of attack", "circular level flight", "fixed target detection", "fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle", "gimbaled camera", "pitch angle calibration", "pseudopitch angle compensation", "real-time method", "single-antenna GPS-guided UAV", "three-dimensional location", "triangulation", "vision-based target localization", "wind influence", "wind velocity", "Aircraft", "Calibration", "Cameras", "Global Positioning System", "Goniometers", "Target tracking", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", "Vehicle detection", "Velocity measurement", "Wind speed", ""], "arnumber": "4667717"}
