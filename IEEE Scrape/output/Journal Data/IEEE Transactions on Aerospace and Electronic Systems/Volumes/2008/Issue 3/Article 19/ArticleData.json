Several methods based on maximum likelihood (ML) criteria and parameterization of signals or noise covariances have been established. Generally, to obtain the exact ML (EML) solutions, the DOAs must be jointly estimated along with other noise or signal parameters by optimizing a complicated nonlinear function over a high-dimensional problem space. Although the computation complexity can be reduced via derivation of suboptimal approximate ML (AML) functions using large sample assumption or least square criteria, nevertheless the AML estimators still require multi-dimensional search and the accuracy is lost to some extent. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) based solution is proposed here to compute the EML functions and explore the potential superior performances. A key characteristic of PSO is that the algorithm itself is highly robust yet remarkably simple to implement, while processing similar capabilities as other evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA). Simulation results confirm the advantage of paring PSO with EML, and the PSO-EML estimator is shown to significantly outperform AML-based techniques in various scenarios at less computational costs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1079", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1090", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10299598", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "1079 - 1090", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Minghui Li", "Yilong Lu"], "keywords": ["computational complexity", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "genetic algorithms", "least mean squares methods", "maximum likelihood estimation", "nonlinear functions", "particle swarm optimisation", "colored noise fields", "computational complexity", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "evolutionary algorithms", "genetic algorithm", "least square criteria", "maximum likelihood DOA estimation", "maximum likelihood criteria", "multidimensional search", "noise covariances", "nonlinear function", "particle swarm optimization based solution", "signals parameterization", "suboptimal approximate functions", "Colored noise", "Computational modeling", "Direction of arrival estimation", "Evolutionary computation", "Genetic algorithms", "Least squares approximation", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Particle swarm optimization", "Robustness", "Working environment noise", ""], "arnumber": "4655365"}
