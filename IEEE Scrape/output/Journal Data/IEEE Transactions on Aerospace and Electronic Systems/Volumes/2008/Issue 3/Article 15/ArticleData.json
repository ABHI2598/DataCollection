The RF hardware section integration is achieved by means of a customized chip-set of just four multi-chip multifunction MMIC (MCMM) modules. The functions contained in the monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) include the active circuits needed for the front-end low noise amplifier (LNA), the RF and IF converters, all the variable gain amplifiers (VGAs), the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) for both transmit and receive sections, the frequency prescaler and multiplier needed to synthesize the frequency plan as well as the local oscillator (LO) amplifiers. The selected technology is GaAs, mainly due to its radiation hardness, essential for aerospace applications, and good reliability. Issues such as suitable circuit topology, efficient dc biasing, circuit area minimization, cost-oriented system design and advanced packaging techniques have been addressed during the design. Measurements and yield results from the manufactured circuits will be presented showing that these components, even though especially designed in the frame of the GALILEO TT&C transponder predevelopment, are suitable for a variety of missions, from deep space to near Earth, including spread-spectrum transponders with precision ranging function.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1029", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1041", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10299596", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "1029 - 1041", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
