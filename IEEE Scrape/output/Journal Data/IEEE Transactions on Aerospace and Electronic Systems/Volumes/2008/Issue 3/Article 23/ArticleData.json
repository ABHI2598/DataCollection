At first, assuming prior knowledge of K, a binary generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is derived, which shows that the multi-target TBD problem can be regarded as a K-path trellis search. Since optimal implementation of the GLRT has a nonlinear complexity either in the number of targets or in the number of integrated frames, suboptimum algorithms are investigated which allow to trade better estimation and tracking accuracy for a much lower implementation complexity. Next, the TBD problem with K unknown is discussed and a novel multi-hypothesis test strategy is derived as the solution to a constrained optimization problem, which subsumes the conventional binary GLRT as the special case of known K. Finally, numerical examples are provided to assess and compare the performances of the proposed TBD procedures.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1135", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1150", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10299602", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "1135 - 1150", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Stefano Buzzi", "Marco Lops", "Luca Venturino", "Maurizio Ferri"], "keywords": ["optimisation", "radar tracking", "target tracking", "K-path trellis search", "binary generalized likelihood ratio test", "constrained optimization problem", "multi-hypothesis test strategy", "multi-target environment", "multiple moving targets", "nonlinear complexity", "radar systems", "suboptimum algorithms", "track-before-detect procedures", "Constraint optimization", "Laser radar", "Object detection", "Optical filters", "Optical sensors", "Radar antennas", "Radar detection", "Radar tracking", "Target tracking", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "4655369"}
