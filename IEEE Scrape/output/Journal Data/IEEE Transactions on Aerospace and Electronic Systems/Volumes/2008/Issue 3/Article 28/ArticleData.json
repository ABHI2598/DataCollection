Accordingly, the problem of source separation and tracking for time-varying systems of moving sources is studied. Using techniques borrowed from independent component analysis (ICA) and numerical linear algebra, a processing solution is formulated. The ULV decomposition (ULVD), a member of the complete orthogonal decompositions (CODs) family is used to normalize and decorrelate the data. Since the ULVD is known to stably update and downdate with time-varying data, this step is named ULVD adaptive whitening. The ICA-based EASI (equivariant adaptive separation based on independence) algorithm is adapted to provide not only separated sources but direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates. Developed improvements to this technique are an adaptive filter method for estimating the mixing matrix from the newly estimated signals as well as a simple cross-over detection scheme. Finally, the developed solutions are tested in simulation examples using meaningful performance measures.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1198", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1214", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10299605", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "1198 - 1214", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Christian M.
