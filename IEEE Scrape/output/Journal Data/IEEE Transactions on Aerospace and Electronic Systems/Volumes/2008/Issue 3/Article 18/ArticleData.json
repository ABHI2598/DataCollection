We expand the algorithm to include nonorthogonality within a sensor set for both two- and three-axis sensors. Nonorthogonality can result from manufacturing issues, installation geometry, and in the case of magnetometers, from soft iron bias errors. Simulation studies for both two- and three-axis sensors show convergence of the improved algorithm to the true values, even in the presence of realistic measurement noise. Finally the algorithm is experimentally validated on a low-cost solid-state three-axis magnetometer set, which shows definite improvement postcalibration. We note that the algorithm is general and can be applied to any two- or three-axis sensor set (such as accelerometers) with an error model consisting of scale, offset, and nonorthogonality errors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1070", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1078", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10289537", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "1070 - 1078", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
