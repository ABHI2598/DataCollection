The strong dependence of the acquisition performance on the decision strategy is shown, establishing the role of decision probabilities. Three acquisition strategies are analyzed and a new model describing the performance of a hybrid acquisition system is developed. The theoretical models are validated by simulations, and secondary phenomena, generally neglected in the literature, are also discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "996", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1011", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10289547", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "996 - 1011", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Daniele Borio", "Laura Camoriano", "Letizia Lo Presti"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "decision theory", "delay estimation", "frequency estimation", "probability", "radio receivers", "signal detection", "Doppler frequency estimation", "GPS acquisition strategy", "GPS receiver", "Global Positioning System", "code delay rough estimation", "decision probability", "signal acquisition process", "Delay estimation", "Frequency estimation", "Global Positioning System", "Performance analysis", "Satellite navigation systems", "Sequential analysis", "Signal generators", "Signal processing", "Signal synthesis", "Statistical analysis", ""], "arnumber": "4655359"}
