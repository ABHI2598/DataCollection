In contrast to previously published guidance laws, it does not require knowledge of the range to the target. This makes it appropriate for use on platforms which have an imaging device, such as a video camera, as a primary sensor. We prove that with idealized dynamic model, the guidance law results in zero miss distance, and a formula is given for impact angle error which tends to zero as does target speed, making this method particularly suitable against slow moving targets. Computer simulations are used to test the law with a more realistic model, with a video camera and optical-flow algorithm providing target information. It is shown to perform well compared with another law from the literature, despite requiring less information.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "835", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "851", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10289540", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "835 - 851", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ian R.
