Part I: Compatibility and phasing", "abstract": "Flower Constellations are special satellite constellations whose satellites follow the same 3-dimensional space track with respect to assigned rotating reference frame. This paper presents the theoretical foundation of compatibility and phasing of the Flower Constellations. Compatibility is the synchronization property of a Flower Constellation with respect to a rotating reference frame while phasing dictates the satellite distribution property. Compatibility and phasing, which are ruled by a set of five independent integer parameters, constitute the two main properties of the Flower Constellations. In particular, the dual-compatible Flower Constellations theory, which allows a simultaneous synchronization of the Flower Constellation dynamics with two independent rotating reference frames, is introduced. Meaningful examples and potential applications are briefly discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "953", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "962", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10289544", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "953 - 962", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Daniele Mortari", "Matthew P.
