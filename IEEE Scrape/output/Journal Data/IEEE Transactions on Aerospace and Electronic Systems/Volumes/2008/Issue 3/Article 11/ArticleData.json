The current PL equations for satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS) rely on Gaussian statistics. This approach is very practical: the calculations are simple and the receiver computation load is small. However, when the true distributions are far from Gaussian, such a characterization forces an inflation of the PLs that degrades performance. This happens in particular with errors with heavy tail distributions or for which there is not enough data to evaluate the distribution density up to small quantiles. We present a way of computing the optimal protection level when the pseudo-range errors are characterized by a mixture of Gaussian modes. First, we show that this error characterization adds a new flexibility and helps account for heavy tails without losing the benefit of tight core distributions. Then, we state the positioning problem using a Bayesian approach. Finally, we apply this method to PL calculations for the wide area augmentation system (WAAS) using real data from WAAS receivers. The results are very promising: vertical PLs are reduced by 50% without degrading integrity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "977", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "984", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10289546", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "977 - 984", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Juan Blanch", "Todd Walter", "Per Enge"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "Gaussian processes", "protection", "satellite navigation", "Bayesian approach", "GNSS", "Gaussian statistics", "measurement residuals", "position error bound calculation", "positioning error", "protection level equation", "pseudo-range errors", "satellite navigation", "satellite-based augmentation systems", "wide area augmentation system", "Bayesian methods", "Degradation", "Equations", "Frequency", "Global Positioning System", "Position measurement", "Probability distribution", "Protection", "Satellite navigation systems", "Statistical distributions", ""], "arnumber": "4655357"}
