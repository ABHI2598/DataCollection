The attitude controller consists of a linear feedback term and a discontinuous feedback ones. An adaptive version of the proposed attitude controller is also achieved through releasing the limitation of knowing the bounds of the lumped perturbations in advance. An additional independent control system acting on the flexible parts can be designed for further vibration suppression. Simulation results have shown the theoretical and practical merit of this approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "861", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "876", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10289541", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "861 - 876", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Qinglei Hu", "Guangfu Ma"], "keywords": ["adaptive control", "attitude control", "control system synthesis", "feedback", "flexible structures", "perturbation techniques", "piezoelectric materials", "space vehicles", "variable structure systems", "vibration control", "active vibration suppression", "adaptive variable structure controller design", "attitude control", "discontinuous feedback", "flexible spacecraft vibration reduction", "linear feedback", "lumped perturbation", "piezoelectric material", "Actuators", "Adaptive control", "Aircraft manufacture", "Damping", "Feedback", "Flexible structures", "Piezoelectric materials", "Programmable control", "Space vehicles", "Vibration control", ""], "arnumber": "4655349"}
