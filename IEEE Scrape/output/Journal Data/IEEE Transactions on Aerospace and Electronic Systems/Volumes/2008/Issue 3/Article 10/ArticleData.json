In this work, the particular phasing theory that we have adopted is discussed in full. As a consequence of this choice of parametrization, a new class of orbit theory has emerged: secondary paths (SPs). The theory of SPs is developed and proved in this work. Examples of SPs are presented and discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the equivalency of Flower Constellations and resolve how certain disparate choices of integer parameters can generate identical satellite distributions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "964", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "976", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10289545", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "964 - 976", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Matthew P.
