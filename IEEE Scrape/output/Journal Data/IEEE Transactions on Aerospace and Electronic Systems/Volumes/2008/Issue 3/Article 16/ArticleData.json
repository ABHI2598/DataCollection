Due to the increasing resolution capabilities of modern sensors, however, this assumption is often no longer valid as different scattering centers of an object can cause distinct detections when passing the signal processing chain. Examples of extended targets are found in short-range applications (littoral surveillance, autonomous weapons, or robotics). A collectively moving target group can also be considered as an extended target. This point of view is the more appropriate, the smaller the mutual distances between the individual targets are. Due to the resulting data association and resolution conflicts any attempt of tracking the individual objects within the group seems to be no longer reasonable. With simulated sensor data produced by a partly unresolvable aircraft formation the addressed phenomena are illustrated and an approximate Bayesian solution to the resulting tracking problem is proposed. Ellipsoidal object extensions are modeled by random matrices, which are treated as additional state variables to be estimated or tracked. We expect that the resulting tracking algorithms are also relevant for tracking large, collectively moving target swarms.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1042", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1059", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10299597", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "1042 - 1059", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Johann Wolfgang Koch"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "filtering theory", "matrix algebra", "pattern clustering", "random processes", "sensor fusion", "tracking", "Bayes method", "cluster tracking", "object extension", "random matrix", "sensor data fusion", "tracking algorithms", "Bayesian methods", "Clustering algorithms", "Object detection", "Scattering", "Sensor fusion", "Signal processing", "Signal processing algorithms", "Signal resolution", "Surveillance", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "4655362"}
