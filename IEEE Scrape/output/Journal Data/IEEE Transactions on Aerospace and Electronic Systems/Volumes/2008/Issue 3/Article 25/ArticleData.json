However, for some random variables, the probability density function (pdf) has no closed analytical form. Therefore, it is very hard or impossible to evaluate the CRLB directly. In these cases the characteristic function may still have a closed and even simple form. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the CRLB via the characteristic function. As an example, the CRLB of the scale parameter and the shape parameter of the K-distribution is accurately evaluated with the proposed method. Also, it is shown that for pdfs with a scale parameter, the CRLB for the remaining parameters do not depend on the scale parameter. This allows for easier evaluation of the bound.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1161", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1168", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10299603", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "1161 - 1168", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Steven Kay", "Cuichun Xu"], "keywords": ["parameter estimation", "signal processing", "statistical distributions", "CRLB", "Cramer-Rao lower bound", "K-distribution", "characteristic function", "probability density function", "scale parameter", "shape parameter", "statistical signal processing", "unbiased estimator", "Biomedical computing", "Biomedical engineering", "Biomedical signal processing", "Biosensors", "Force sensors", "Frequency domain analysis", "Military computing", "Probability density function", "Random variables", "Shape", ""], "arnumber": "4655371"}
