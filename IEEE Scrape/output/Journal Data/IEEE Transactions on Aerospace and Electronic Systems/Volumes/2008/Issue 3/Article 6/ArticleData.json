The proposed UVPC comprises a linear optimal controller (LOC), a supplementary voltage regulator (SVR), and a supplementary pitch angle controller (SPC). An AC voltage regulator and a DC voltage regulator are designed in the SVR to generate the desired voltage magnitude and phase angle for the voltage-sourced inverter (VSI). On the other hand, the SPC is designed based on fuzzy logic inference rules in order to generate the desired pitch angle command for the variable blade pitch such that the mechanical power can be controlled in a very efficient manner. When the system is operated in the islanding condition, an approach based on the concept of relative rotating speed has been developed for the measurement of system frequency deviation. Simulation and experimental results reveal that both bus voltage and mechanical power can be effectively controlled by the proposed UVPC for the wind energy conversion system (WECS) either connected with or disconnected from the power grid when there is sufficient wind energy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "913", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "926", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10286337", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "913 - 926", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["W.
