The statistical properties of the radar cross-ambiguity function are developed and used to arrive at an expression for the target resolution probability. The analysis is verified through simulations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1234", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1239", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10299608", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "1234 - 1239", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hasan S.
