We successively introduce ldquogeometricalrdquo and statistical concepts, where we respectively emphasize the 4D direction-Doppler (DD) curve and the 4D power spectral density (PSD) that characterize the (clutter) space-time field. These descriptors, which are flight-configuration dependent, but antenna independent, are fundamental since they can be used to derive the key spectral properties of any antenna, essentially by rotations and projections. These descriptors are related in various ways, mostly because the DD curve is the support of the ridge of the clutter PSD. We also emphasize the surprising benefits of systematically considering the three spatial frequencies that are always present behind the scene, even for the customary linear antenna. A solid, simple, and elegant basis for thinking about STAP for arbitrary measurement configurations and antenna arrays is provided.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1118", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1135", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10299601", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "1118 - 1135", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Philippe Ries", "Xavier Neyt", "Fabian D.
