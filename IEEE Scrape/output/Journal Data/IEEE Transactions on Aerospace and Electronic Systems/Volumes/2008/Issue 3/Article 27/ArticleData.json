Even a simple low-order AR model becomes complicated by varying amplitude and additive white noise. However, by approximating the signal amplitude as piecewise-constant, an efficient filtering approach can be applied in order to compute the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate for the entire data record. The model is efficient both in terms of having a compact set of parameters and in the computational sense. Simulation results are provided. The algorithm has applications in signal modeling for underwater acoustic signals, particularly active wideband signals such as explosive sources.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1183", "volume": "44", "lastpage": "1197", "date_publication": "July 2008", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10286336", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "1183 - 1197", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Paul M.
