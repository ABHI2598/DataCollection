It consists of a magnetic aspect system and a solar aspect system, and has been flown successfully on two missions. The development was aimed at achieving maximum precision while observing the severe restrictions natural in a small satellite. The result is a set of instruments differing in several respects from previously existing hardware. The flight results have proved very interesting and are expected to yield useful technological experience.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "132", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "141", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "132 - 141", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
