A simple equation for the two dimensional spectrum of the input is derived. The resulting equations are used to compute curves showing the time variation of the optimum filter bandwidth and the variation of the output signal-to-noise ratio.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "213", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "216", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "213 - 216", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
