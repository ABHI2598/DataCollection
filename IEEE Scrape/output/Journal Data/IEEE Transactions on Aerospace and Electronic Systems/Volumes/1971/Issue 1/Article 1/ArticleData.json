A statistical analysis of the number of repeaters is presented as the basis for a crime control system consisting of a transponder carried by each convicted person after he is released from confinement. Real-time tracking of these transponders is done by a computer-radio system; when a crime is committed a quick check shows at least who was not involved. Countermeasures and some social implications are also covered.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "2 - 22", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
