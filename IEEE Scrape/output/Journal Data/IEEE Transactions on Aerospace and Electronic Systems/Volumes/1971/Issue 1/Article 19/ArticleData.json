This paper is an extension of the earlier work to include fluctuating targets. The Swerling I, II, III, and IV models are considered when single-pulse detection is of interest. An adaptive threshold procedure is also briefly discussed whereby the probability of false alarm at any given resolution cell is maintained constant, even though the input clutter level may vary from cell to cell or from beam position to beam position. Useful data are presented for detection probabilities in the range 0.5 to 0.9, for false alarm probabilities in the range 104 to 10-8, and for a false detection probability of 0.1 for a sidelobe target yielding an apparent signal to total noise power density ratio of 13.0 dB in the main beam receiver.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "147", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "159", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "147 - 159", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["H.
