Although aeronautical system suppliers have implemented improved procedures and design approaches which are generally effective, challenges continue to exist. This paper explores several areas where overall aeronautical system design might be improved by proper emphasis on avionic subsystem design. The topics selected include standardization, weight impact, environmental control, maintainability, and avionic equipment growth. Comparisons are made in terms of ultimate cost to the aeronautical system user.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "42", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "42 - 46", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Warren E.
