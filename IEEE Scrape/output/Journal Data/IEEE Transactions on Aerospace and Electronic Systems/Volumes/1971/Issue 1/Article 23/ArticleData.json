The basic techniques described, which include pure amplitude monopulse, phase and amplitude monopulse (two-and three-channel configurations), and pure phase monopulse interferometer, are particularly applicable to monopulse direction finding systems that require frequency coverage over several octaves and open-loop angle bearing of several degrees. Sufficient detail and working formulas are included to permit a trade-off analysis to be made between the direction-finding techniques for selection in specific hardware applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "188", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "203", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "188 - 203", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["L.
