A mathematical expression is developed, in which an upper bound of the error of the measured angle difference and position locations owing to multipath is expressed in terms of geometrical system parameters and the amplitude and phase of the multipath signal. Because diffuse reflection from a rough surface is predominant, the spectrum of multipath reflections is calculated. Multipath rejection by filtering is discussed, and curves for the position errors are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "122", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "131", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "122 - 131", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["E.
