A rationale for selecting among these filters, which include a Kalman filter, a simplified Kalman filter, an \u00c2\u00bf-\u00c3\u009f filter, a Wiener filter, and a two-point extrapolator, is illustrated by two examples taken from the authors' recent experience.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "100", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "110", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "100 - 110", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Robert A.
