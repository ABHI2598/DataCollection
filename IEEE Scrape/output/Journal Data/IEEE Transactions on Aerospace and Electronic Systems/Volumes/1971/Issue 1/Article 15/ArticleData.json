Formulas to determine costs per voice-circuit-mile, and per television-channel-mile, are developed. The specific facilities investigated are the TD-2, TD-3, and TH radio relay systems, and the L-3 12-tube and L-4 20-tube coaxial cable systems. The radio relay systems are significantly, with one exception, less expensive than coaxial cable systems over their design capacity ranges. The L-4 20-tube coaxial cable system (32 400 voice circuits) and the TD-3 radio relaysystem (12 000 voice circuits) have approximately equal investment costs per voice-circuit-mile ($3.40) at full capacity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "115", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "121", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "115 - 121", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
