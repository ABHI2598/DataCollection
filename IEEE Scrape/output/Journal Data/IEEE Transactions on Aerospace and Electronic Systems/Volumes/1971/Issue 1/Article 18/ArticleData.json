Detection probabilities of this process are binomially distributed, making it difficult to obtain exact results for large values of the number of samples and for low probabilities of false alarm. In this paper, the M out of N detection algorithm is defined and detection performance is calculated for the special cases of the nonfluctuating target and Swerling cases I and 11 for false alarm probabilities of 106, 10-8 and 10-10.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "142", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "146", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "142 - 146", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Joel F.
