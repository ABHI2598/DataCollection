Accuracy of Angle Measurement", "abstract": "In this paper expressions are derived for the error in position measurement for the problem of estimating the position of an infrared target in a random background and the combined prob lem when white detector noise is also affecting the estimation. Space filters performing linear scanning, nutation, and rotation are considered. A linear scanning infrared system is then considered in greater detail. The noise on the error signal is calculated, taking into account both the estimation error, as discussed in the first part, and \"false alarms\" occurring in the scan area far from the target.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "34 - 41", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hans Samuelsson"], "keywords": ["Background noise", "Frequency", "Goniometers", "Infrared detectors", "Matched filters", "Noise measurement", "Optical filters", "Optical noise", "Position measurement", "Random processes", ""], "arnumber": "4103656"}
