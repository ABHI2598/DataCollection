The numerical solution of such problems is often difficult because of roundoff and truncation errors. In this paper numerical methods for digital computer solutions are considered for a system described by a given second-order linear differential equation and the results are compared. The results show that where accurate analytic solutions cannot be obtained, the invariant imbedding technique yields more accurate results, for a given integration grid interval, than the other methods considered.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "73", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "78", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "73 - 78", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Karl Spingarn"], "keywords": ["Aircraft", "Boundary conditions", "Boundary value problems", "Differential equations", "Finite wordlength effects", "Integral equations", "Linear systems", "Matrices", "Optimal control", "Riccati equations", ""], "arnumber": "4103662"}
