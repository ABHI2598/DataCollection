Multiple lateral ly separated antennas are used which sense the ILS signal on and around the approach path. Combining these signals suppresses ILS beam distortion produced by multipath signal interference and provides much improved guidance information to the landing aircraft control system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "47", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "53", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "47 - 53", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["James R.
