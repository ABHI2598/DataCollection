A generalized computer program results which can be used to determine the reflection from surfaces of most materials and orientations for which the radius of curvature is large compared with the wavelength. For most reflecting walls, a closed form solution is used and the computation time is short. The program will enable users to determine the placement of hangars, towers, etc., in airports and to find ways to reduce their effect on localizer facilities.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "54", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "60", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "54 - 60", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
