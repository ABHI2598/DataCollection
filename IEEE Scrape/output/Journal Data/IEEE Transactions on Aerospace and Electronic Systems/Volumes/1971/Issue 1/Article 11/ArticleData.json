In particular, noisy observations of body angular rate, normal acceleration, and control surface deflec tion are used in the algorithm to obtain estimates of body angular rate, angle of attack, control surface deflection, air density, and missile velocity. Computational results obtained for this problem are presented. These results are evaluated to determine the applicapility of this estimator as a part of an adaptive control scheme. In addition, a general approach to the formulation of practical nonlinear estimation problems is suggested.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "79", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "84", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "79 - 84", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
