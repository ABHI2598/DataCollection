Under certain conditions the angles, amplitude ratio, and relative phase of two unresolved targets can theoretically be determined by meas urements of the complex indicated angle on two pulses separated by a short interval. In the special case of multipath, known relationships between the unresolved target and image theoretically permit determination of target elevation with a single pulse.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "160", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "170", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "160 - 170", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Samuel M.
