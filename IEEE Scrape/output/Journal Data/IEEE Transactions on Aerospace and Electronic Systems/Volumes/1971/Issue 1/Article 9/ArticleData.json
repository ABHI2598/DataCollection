The operating system, or executive, of this computer may be implemented in various ways. These include a totally software \"floating executive,\" one dedicated to a specific processor, or an executive consisting of special-purpose hardware. The objections to hardware executives, especially for avionic applications, include a supposed degradation in system reliability. This paper shows that under certain conditions this degradation need not occur.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "67", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "72", "date_publication": "Jan. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "67 - 72", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ronald S.
