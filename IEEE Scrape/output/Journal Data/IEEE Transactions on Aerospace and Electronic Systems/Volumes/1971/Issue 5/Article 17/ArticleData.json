The analysis is based on an approach that seems potentially convenient in the analysis of other systems that are physically stable but mathematically nonlinear.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "914", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "921", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "914 - 921", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Cynthia Whitney"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Backscatter", "Cause effect analysis", "Computer simulation", "Contracts", "Frequency", "Laboratories", "Laser modes", "Ring lasers", "Steady-state", ""], "arnumber": "4103822"}
