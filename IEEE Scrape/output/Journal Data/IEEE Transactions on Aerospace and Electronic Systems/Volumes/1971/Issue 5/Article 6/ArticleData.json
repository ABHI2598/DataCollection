The accuracy of this class of direction-finding system is limited by interpolation, gain mistracking, and additive-noise errors. The channel gain mistracking error is shown to be significantly lower than previously estimated. Typical calculations show that the trigonometric interpolation technique is an order of magnitude more accurate than previously supposed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "804", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "808", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "804 - 808", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Melvin Sandler", "Robert Goodwin"], "keywords": ["Antenna arrays", "Azimuth", "Chromium", "Detectors", "Directive antennas", "Interpolation", "Navigation", "Receiving antennas", "Signal processing", "Voltage", ""], "arnumber": "4103811"}
