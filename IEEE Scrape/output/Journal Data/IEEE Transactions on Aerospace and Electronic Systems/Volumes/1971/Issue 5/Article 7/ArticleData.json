Unified refers to the fact that the tracking, telemetry, and command functions are all performed using a single RF channel and, at least ideally, a single set of equipment. The principles are outlined, followed by descriptions of several novel applications to the control of multiple vehicles. Examples based upon existing systems also are provided.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "809", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "829", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "809 - 829", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["B.
