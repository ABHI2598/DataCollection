Maximum likelihood receivers are compared with conventional phase-locked receivers by theoretical and simulation methods as phase estimators based on signal measurements only. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement is examined and filter recommendations made. An adaptive maximum likelihood receiver is then developed which uses both signal measurements and a priori data to improve phase estimation accuracy. Simulation results indicate a 33.3 dB processing gain yielding a ranging error standard deviation of \u00c2\u00b115 feet for zero dB received SNR. Nonadaptive and adaptive receivers are fabricated, flight tested, and experimental results reported.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "863", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "874", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "863 - 874", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Patrick H.
