The evolution of the transient suppressor development for the U.S. Army is presented with emphasis on space, weight, and cost considerations. Improvements including an electronic thermal switch and a \"battle override\" switch are also described. A futuristic transient suppressor of modular design developed for use as an integral part of the equipment being protected is functionally described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "792", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "797", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "792 - 797", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bernard Reich", "John Erickson"], "keywords": ["Aerospace electronics", "Circuits", "Costs", "Delay", "Diodes", "Laboratories", "Military aircraft", "Protection", "Regulators", "Switches", ""], "arnumber": "4103809"}
