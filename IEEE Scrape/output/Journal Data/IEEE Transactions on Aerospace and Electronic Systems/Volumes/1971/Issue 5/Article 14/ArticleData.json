The tracking is accomplished by range measurements to the satellite from three stations using signals transponded by the satellite. These same signals also functioned as the timing signals for the synchronization of other stations' clocks. Although the range measurements were of low resolution by usual standards, approximately 3000 meters, they provided the delays necessary to synchronize clocks to 40 microseconds or better. These results were obtained over a 4-month period using two satellites with measurements from five stations in the United States and South America.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "895", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "899", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "895 - 899", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
