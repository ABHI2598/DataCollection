For all other frequencies or orders, the spectrum contains no lines, but the power spectral density takes all values in the range [0,oo] in every interval, however short, while being almost everywhere zero. For detecting the presence of a sinusoid by means of Walsh analysis, the time scale should therefore be chosen so that the order of the Walsh function is a power of 2 and the Walsh function is a Rademacher function, i.e., a hard-limited sinusoid of the frequency being sought.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "900", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "905", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "900 - 905", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Nelson M.
