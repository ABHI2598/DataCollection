The idealized ground plane approximates the practical case of a site consisting of an expanse of relatively flat ground plane ending in a precipitous dropoff or in rough diffusely reflecting terrain. The computed results show several phenomena which have repeatedly been observed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "854", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "862", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "854 - 862", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Robert W.
