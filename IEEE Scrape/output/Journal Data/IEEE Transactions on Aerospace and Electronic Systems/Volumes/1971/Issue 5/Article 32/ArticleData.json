In this correspondence the nature of the inaccuracy is described, an exact expression for the mean is derived, and asymptotic expressions for the cases of low signal-to-noise and high signal-to-noise are obtained and compared to the previous result.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1009", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "1011", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "1009 - 1011", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Morton A.
