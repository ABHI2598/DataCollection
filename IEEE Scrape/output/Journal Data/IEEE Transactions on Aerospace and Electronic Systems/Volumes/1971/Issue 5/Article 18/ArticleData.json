An N-cell target model is assumed, which contains k reflecting cells, each reflecting independently according to the same Rayleigh amplitude distribution. It will be referred to as the (N,k) target. Detection based on one transmitted pulse is performed against a background of white normal noise. Detection in stationary clutter is also considered. The optimum detector is obtained but, in view of its complexity, the performance of a simpler detector, the square-law envelope detector with linear integrator (SLEDLI), is analyzed, and a formula for the probability of detection is obtained. Graphs are presented which show the probability of detection as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (\u007fSNR) for various values of N k, and false alarm probability. For N/k not too large it is shown that the SLEDLI is near optimum.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "922", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "931", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "922 - 931", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Gerard A.
