The antenna consists of two vertical arrays of half-wavelength dipoles mounted near a circular conducting cylinder. Each vertical array is composed of three vertical dipoles. Each array provides relatively uniform illumination (2-3 dB) in the forward 180 angular segment of the horizontal plane and approximately + 10-150 coverage in the vertical plane. The antenna could be used in a two-mode operation, either in a standard monopulse radar system (sum and difference amplitude patterns) or in a system where amplitude and phase are the measurable quantities.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "960", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "967", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "960 - 967", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Constantine A.
