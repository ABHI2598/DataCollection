The smoother is a very simple structure incorporating all the sophistication of the underlyirig Kalman filtering and smoothing algorithms. The limitations of the smoother are outlined. It is shown how the simple smoother structure can be exploited in performing straightforward smoothing sensitivity analysis. An application of applying the finite memory smoother to the evaluation of ship's inertial system velocity errors is described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "968", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "973", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "968 - 973", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["H.
