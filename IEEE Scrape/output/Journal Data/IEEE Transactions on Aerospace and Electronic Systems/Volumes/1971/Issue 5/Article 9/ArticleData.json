It is assumed that the interceptors and targets are described by linear time-varying differential equations (deterministic or stochastic). Under certain assumptions both the optimal (static or dynamic) interceptor-target allocation and the guidance of each interceptor for the optimal allocation can be obtained with modest real-time and storage computer requirements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "843", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "853", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "843 - 853", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Michael Athans"], "keywords": ["Aerodynamics", "Control systems", "Differential equations", "Electric variables control", "Government", "Laboratories", "Military computing", "Motion control", "Stochastic processes", "Switches", ""], "arnumber": "4103814"}
