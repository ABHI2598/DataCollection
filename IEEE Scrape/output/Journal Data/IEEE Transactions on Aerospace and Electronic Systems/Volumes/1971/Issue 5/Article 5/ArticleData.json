The input carrier signal is amplitude-modulated by wide-band stationary Gaussian noise, and the signal, superposed with the additive white stationary Gaussian noise, enters the nonlimited phase-locked loop. Under the above assumptions the loop can be shown to constitute an n-dimensional vector Markov process, so that the process satisfies the n-dimensional Fokker-Plank equation. The probability density function depends on the effective loop signal-to-noise ratio and the effective modulation power.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "798", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "803", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "798 - 803", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Keizo Suzuki", "Toshihiko Namekawa"], "keywords": ["Additive noise", "Equations", "Gaussian noise", "Markov processes", "Phase locked loops", "Phase noise", "Probability density function", "Signal to noise ratio", "Voltage-controlled oscillators", "Wideband", ""], "arnumber": "4103810"}
