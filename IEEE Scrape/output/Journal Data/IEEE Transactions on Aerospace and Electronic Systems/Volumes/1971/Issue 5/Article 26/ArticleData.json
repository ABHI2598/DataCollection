The interrelationships among the loop band-width, acquisition time, and the loop signal-to-noise ratio are established for a given probability of acquisition. The Doppler rate tracking capability of the second-order loop is considered. The probability of time to lose lock is derived by the Fokker-Planck techniques. The results of the study are used to determine the loop bandwidth and the signal-to-noise ratio requirements of Venus and Jupiter probes' communication links.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "988", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "994", "date_publication": "Sept. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "988 - 994", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Chi-hau Chen"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Filters", "Frequency", "Jupiter", "Phase locked loops", "Probes", "Relays", "Signal to noise ratio", "Tracking loops", "Venus", ""], "arnumber": "4103831"}
