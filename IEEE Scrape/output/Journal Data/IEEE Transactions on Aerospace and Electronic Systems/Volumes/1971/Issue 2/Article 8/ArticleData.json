Each pulse amplitude is dependent upon the hopping frequency and the selectivity characteristic of the victim receiver. The probability density function for the interfering pulse amplitude prior to demodulation is determined when the probability density function for the hopping frequency is uniform and the victim-receiver characteristic is 1) ideal flat bandpass, 2) single tuned, and 3) Gaussian shaped. It is shown that the average interfering pulse amplitude and interference power decrease as the frequency-hopping bandwidth increases with respect to the victim-receiver bandwidth. Fast Fourier transform computer techniques are used to obtain the probability density function of the interference amplitude in a Gaussian receiver when several (from 2 to 10) pseudo-random frequency-hopping systems are simultaneously using the same frequency band. The probability that the interference exceeds a prescribed threshold value is computed from the derived probability density functions. This probability may be used in signal-to-interference ratio calculations, to describe the capture effect, or to compute the expected number of clicks produced in an FM discriminator.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "279", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "287", "date_publication": "March 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "279 - 287", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Stanley A.
