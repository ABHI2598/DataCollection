Certain important aspects of the design are discussed, including satellite antenna beam coverage, transponder bandwidth, and transponder radiated power for a given weight range. A baseline satellite design is then presented which has 24 transponders (with 4000 watts radiated power on-axis and 34-MHz radio-frequency bandwidth) fully accessible from the 48 contiguous United States. The design uses crossed linear polarization to reuse the satellite transmit and receive frequency spectrum.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "263", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "268", "date_publication": "March 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "263 - 268", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Robert D.
