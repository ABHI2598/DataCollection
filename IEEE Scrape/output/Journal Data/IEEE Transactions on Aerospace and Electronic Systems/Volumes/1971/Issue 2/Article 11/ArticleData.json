Two different types of tracking systems are considered and, in both systems, the range-rate measurement is changed by the amount begin{equation*} |Delta dot{r}| = frac{|1 pm 1/k|}{2} lambda_{t}f_{s} end{equation*} where k is the turn-around ratio of the satellite transponder, Xt is the wavelength of the ground-based transmitter, and fs is the spin rate of the satellite. The positive sign is used if the turnstile antenna elements are connected to give the same polarization for both reception and transmission. If the antenna connections result in different polarizations, the minus sign is used and the magnitude of the effect is reduced.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "316", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "320", "date_publication": "March 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "316 - 320", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["John W.
