This is true particularly where time and/or funding is limited. Here we shall examine RCS data both in the high-frequency and in the lowfrequency ranges to illustrate some of the advantages which accrue from the application of more economical approximate techniques.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "392", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "395", "date_publication": "March 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "392 - 395", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
