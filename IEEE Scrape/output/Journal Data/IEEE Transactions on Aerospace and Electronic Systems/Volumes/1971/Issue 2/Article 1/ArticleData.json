The radio-emission characteristics of the strong discrete (celestial) radio sources, of the sun, and of the moon are presented. Problems encountered when the sensitivity is insufficient for complete radiation pattern determination , when the width of the radio source is comparable to the beamwidth of the antenna, when the illumination of the antenna aperture varies with pointing direction, or when the techniques are extended (after determining the gain of the ground-based antenna) to the measurement of the effective radiated power from a satellite are discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "226", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "234", "date_publication": "March 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "226 - 234", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
