The principal sources of error are instabilities in oscillators in the system, imperfect geostationary orbits, additive noise, and radio propagation effects. Even extreme assumptions of propagation phase instability lead to very small errors. Thus the limitations on stability seem to be imposed by the hardware.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "385", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "391", "date_publication": "March 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "385 - 391", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Alan A.
