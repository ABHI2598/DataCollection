Detectability is interpreted in terms of the performance of the optimum (likelihood ratio) detector for this type of signal. At low false alarm probabilities, long signal bursts interspersed by long periods of signal absence are found to be more detectable than short, rapid bursts. Essentially opposite results are true for shorter bursts.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "398", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "400", "date_publication": "March 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "398 - 400", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
