The method uses the spatial coherence property of these beams and provides accuracies of \u00c2\u00b1 0.01 second of arc or greater. After giving a general description of the method, the feasibility of constructing such systems using presently available lasers and detectors is established. Finally, some aspects of the detection equipment are examined in detail.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "288", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "298", "date_publication": "March 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "288 - 298", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Anthony B.
