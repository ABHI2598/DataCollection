The expression for determining the antenna pattern coordinate as a function of the Earth coordinates is derived. The antenna pattern operator which converts the pattern function into the available power density is obtained. In this case it is assumed that the Earth-based antenna is directed towards the satellite. The radar operator is also derived; this operator yields the power density intercepted by the Earth.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "235", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "242", "date_publication": "March 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "235 - 242", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["E.
