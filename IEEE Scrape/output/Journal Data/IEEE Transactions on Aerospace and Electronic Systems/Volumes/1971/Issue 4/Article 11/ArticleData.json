The probability density function of the phase estimate is developed. The estimator efficiency and performance as a phase synchronizer in a partially coherent receiver are calculated and compared with a first-order phase-locked loop phase estimator.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "652", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "661", "date_publication": "July 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "652 - 661", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jhong S.
