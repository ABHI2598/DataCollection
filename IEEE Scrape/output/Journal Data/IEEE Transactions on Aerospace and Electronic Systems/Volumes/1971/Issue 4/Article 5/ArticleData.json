Other tests included immersion in liquid nitrogen and vibration fatigue tests in excess of one million cycles. The arrays experienced a reduction in output caused by contact failure, fracture in the silicon and cover slide, and disintegration of the honeycomb. Failure modes caused by different cell and interconnect constructions are compared.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "606", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "612", "date_publication": "July 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "606 - 612", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Alan G.
