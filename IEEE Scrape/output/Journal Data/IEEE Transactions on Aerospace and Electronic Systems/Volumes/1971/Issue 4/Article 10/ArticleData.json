New results are developed for the output time and autocorrelation functions. Special results are generated for an ideal clipper. Techniques for obtaining results for practical cases are discussed. The method itself can be modified and applied to non-Gaussian noise and general nonlinear devices with nondeterministic signals.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "644", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "651", "date_publication": "July 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "644 - 651", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Richard W.
