The purpose of this correspondence is: 1) to point out additional references to the work which has been conducted in the stationary noise case, and 2) to present an interesting alternate derivation of the expected output noise power for the nonstationary noise case.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "710", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "711", "date_publication": "July 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "710 - 711", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Gaylord W.
