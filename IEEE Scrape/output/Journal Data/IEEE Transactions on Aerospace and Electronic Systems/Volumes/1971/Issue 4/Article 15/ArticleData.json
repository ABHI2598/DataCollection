The noise performance of this system is analyzed for high signal-to-noise ratios, and an expression is obtained for the variance of the timing errors. This variance is compared with that of systems proposed by other authors on the basis of equal closed-loop noise bandwidth and equal signal shape. It is found that the use of this matched synchronizer enables appreciable timing jitter reductions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "686", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "693", "date_publication": "July 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "686 - 693", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["U.
