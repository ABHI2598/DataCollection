The analysis is based on the concept of a matched-filter receiver, although receiver weighting of the type that reduces Doppler sidelobes is also analyzed in detail. Near the main lobe of the acceleration response is a pedestal-ike sidelobe region, the height of which is about 1/N of the main response lobe power where N is the number of pulses in the train. The extent of this pedestal along the acceleration axis is proportional to N. The acceleration measurement in a clutter environment is best performed when both targets and clutter are confined to this pedestal region, since some response sidelobes outside of this region are extremely large.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "630", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "636", "date_publication": "July 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "630 - 636", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
