However, this is so only when the Doppler distortions are neglected, so that the Doppler effect is taken as a simple translation of the carrier frequency. This paper analyzes the consequences of Doppler distortions on the resolution performance of pulse trains. It is found that Doppler distortions widen the Doppler ambiguities of the pulse train response, with the widening factor proportional to the order of the Doppler ambiguity. This reduces the interval between Doppler ambiguities, and hence the Doppler width of a clutter space that can be accommodated without severe clutter interference. For an operation in a Doppler-ambiguous mode, it also degrades nominal Doppler resolution performance. A detailed analysis of the effects is presented, and numerical results on the widening of the Doppler ambiguities are obtained.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "677", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "685", "date_publication": "July 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "677 - 685", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
