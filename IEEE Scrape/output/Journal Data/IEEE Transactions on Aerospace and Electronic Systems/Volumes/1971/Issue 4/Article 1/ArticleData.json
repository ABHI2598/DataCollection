Engineering education has become an endurance test; the excitement has been lost. Most students strive only to get out. Engineering schools have not yet realized the importance of the involvement of engineers in current environmental problems. They continue to present only the dry technical courses and seem unconcerned about the student's sense of social perspective or his motivation. This paper proposes a freshman awareness seminar plus project oriented learning in the following years as a remedy for this sad situation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "578", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "584", "date_publication": "July 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "578 - 584", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
