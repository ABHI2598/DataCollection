The error propagation is shown to be equivalent for the two cases considered. This equivalence is demonstrated by starting with the error propagation equations for the space-stable system and transforming them to a local-level reference frame. The transformed equations are then compared with the classical local-level error equations, and the equivalence is noted. The specific implementation used in each case considers velocity damping but not altitude damping.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1138", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "1142", "date_publication": "Nov. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "1138 - 1142", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Charles E.
