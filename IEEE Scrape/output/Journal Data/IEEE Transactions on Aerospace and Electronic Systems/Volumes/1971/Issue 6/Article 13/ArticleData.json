The supersonic stream had a mean free path as great as 4 cm, and the drag forces were small. A drag balance was adapted from an electrical analytical balance to measure forces up to 70 dynes with less than 1-percent error. With this balance, the drag of spheres was measured for the Knudsen number range from 1.0 to 5. The freedrop trajectory method yielded drag coefficients in the range of Knudsen numbers from 2.5 to 30. These tests demonstrated the feasibility of making accurate drag measurements under the free-molecule conditions that can be generated by exhausting a gas into a cryogenically pumped vacuum chamber.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1131", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "1137", "date_publication": "Nov. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "1131 - 1137", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["W.
