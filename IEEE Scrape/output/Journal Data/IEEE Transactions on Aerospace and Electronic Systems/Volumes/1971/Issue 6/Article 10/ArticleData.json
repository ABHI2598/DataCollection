For at least one noise model, it is shown that the basic nonlinearity of the optimum detector is a limiter. Performance of this optimum detector is compared with analog cross-correlation and clipper cross-correlation (CCC) detectors. It is shown that the CCC performs nearly optimally, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios, and that its performance is significantly better than that of the analog cross correlator.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1100", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "1112", "date_publication": "Nov. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "1100 - 1112", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
