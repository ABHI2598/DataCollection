A more correct approach is to accept the multipath signal as a second target and utilize a two-target signal processor which angle tracks both wavefronts. The processor will decouple the return signals so that relatively interference-free data on both waves are obtained. In this paper a signal processor for separating signal from (N - 1) multipath components is developed. The processor is then specialized to the case of only one multipath signal and evaluated by a computer simulation. Data show that large improvements are possible as compared to the usual monopulse tracking system. In particular, the usual large bias errors at low elevation angles are eliminated. Tracking precision compares favorably with the theoretically best possible for two-target tracking systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1123", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "1130", "date_publication": "Nov. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "1123 - 1130", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Peyton Z.
