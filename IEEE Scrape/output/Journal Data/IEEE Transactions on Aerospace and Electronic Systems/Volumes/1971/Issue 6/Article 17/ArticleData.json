It was surge-current tested to a peak of 6500 amperes, life tested for 4108 hours, and cycle-life tested for 10 867 cycles while rectifying 250 amperes of current. The transcalent rectifier dissipates heat more effectively and at lower junction temperature than conventional rectifiers as heat is transferred isothermally by vaporization of liquid in the heat pipe. Operational characteristics are: a thermal impedance of 0.030 C/W between junction and fins; a thermal impedance of 0.21 C/W between fins and ambient; a junction operating at 1300C; size less than 14 cubic inches; and weight less than 10 ounces.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1151", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "1156", "date_publication": "Nov. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "1151 - 1156", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
