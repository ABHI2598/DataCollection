A detailed investigation is made of the case where the limiter input signals are phase reversal modulated according to a maximum length linear code. It is shown in this case that a false target signal is generated at the limiter output. The amplitude distribution of the false target signal is investigated along with the distribution of the captured true target signals. A digital computer simulation confirms the theoretically predicted effects.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1170", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "1178", "date_publication": "Nov. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "1170 - 1178", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hermann H.
