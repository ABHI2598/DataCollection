This explains the sizable effort that has gone into studies of radar waveforms, including attempts at the synthesis of optimum waveforms. This paper shows that, despite the unlimited variety of radar signals, waveform selection is a straightforward process. There are only four classes of waveforms, each with distinct resolution properties. When the target environment is analyzed for a particular application, it is rather evident which of these classes will fit the situation best. Choice of the specific waveform within the selected class then is merely a matter of practical implementation. Although the facts used in developing the unified theory of this paper are not new, it is demonstrated that these facts can be combined into an extremely simple theory of waveform design. Much of today's work is guided by past approaches to a particular problem, and when a design is completed there may be a question as to how close to the optimum it is. The theory presented here permits a systematic approach to waveform selection, with the important benefit that the designer knows exactly where and how much he may have deviated from the best design, and why this was done.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1078", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "1086", "date_publication": "Nov. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "1078 - 1086", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["August W.
