Weight has become an increasingly important parameter with the advent of larger and more sophisticated spacecraft, especially those for high-power communication. A computer program for estimating the weight of a high-power dc-to-dc power conditioner as functions of output power, operating frequency, input voltage range, maximum input voltage, and efficiency, respectively, is described, including computer-aided design of inductors and transformers. Curves of typical power conditioner weight as functions of the preceding parameters, derived from the power conditioner weight program, are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1179", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "1194", "date_publication": "Nov. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "1179 - 1194", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Tom T.
