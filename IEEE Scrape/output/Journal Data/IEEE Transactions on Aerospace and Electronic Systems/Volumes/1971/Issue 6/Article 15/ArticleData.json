Pressure altitude is determined as a function of presure based on the standard atmosphere models. Since the atmosphere is almost always nonstandard, large inertial altitude and vertical velocity errors may result. A unique algorithm has been devised to compute a dynamically corrected altitude reference by numerically integrating the physical relation for a column of air as a function of pressure, gravity, and absolute temperature. The new algorithm has been flight tested and has been shown to yield accurate results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1143", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "1146", "date_publication": "Nov. 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Nov. 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "1143 - 1146", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
