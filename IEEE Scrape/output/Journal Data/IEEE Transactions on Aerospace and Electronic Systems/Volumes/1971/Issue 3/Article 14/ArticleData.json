The nonlinear element is a symmetrical limiter (memoryless device) that feeds the linear element. Preceding the limiter is a sampler and zero-order hold unit for data reconstruction. The analysis is predicated on finding an equivalent gain for the nonlinear element such that the mean-square error is a minimum. The nonlinearity is thus replaced by a linear component and the system is then analyzed by conventional techniques. It is also shown that for appropriate sampling rates the sampled-data system is equivalent to a continuous system due to the action of the sampler-hold combination. All calculations pertaining to the limiter input signal require the use of a transfer function that is interior to the feedback loop. However, in developing this transfer function, the overall system is considered so that the system output may be evaluated after the value of equivalent gain has been found.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "521", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "527", "date_publication": "May 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "521 - 527", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["George S.
