This correspondence extends the previous work by first calculating the performance of the trimmed-mean detector and then calculating the detection performance of all three detectors when the target exhibits Rayleigh fluctuations. Finally, a simple example is used to show that the optimal beamwidth of a radar need not be the smallest obtainable beamwidth.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "553", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "556", "date_publication": "May 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "553 - 556", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
