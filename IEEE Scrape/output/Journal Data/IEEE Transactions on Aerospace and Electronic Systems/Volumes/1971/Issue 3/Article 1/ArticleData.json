This complex has discarded our traditional system under which the planning and organizing of productive scientific ventures has been in the hands of responsible professional engineers whose first duty is to serve the best interests of the public. Instead, this complex originates and administers highly sophisticated sciencebased programs, whose open-ended deficit financing is rapidly undermining our American economic system. By this means America is gradually being committed to a system of centralized authority and to the eventual disappearance of human liberty and justice under law. This marks an historic turning point for the world and for all mankind. The scientific term for this process is \"technocratic petrification of freedom\" which ends in \"scientific despotism.\"", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "418", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "428", "date_publication": "May 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "418 - 428", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Adolph J.
