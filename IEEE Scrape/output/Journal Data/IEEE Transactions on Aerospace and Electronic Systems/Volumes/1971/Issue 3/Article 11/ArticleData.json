Optimization procedures are applied to the choice of transmitter signal and receiver weighting. The results are compared to the use of Tschebyscheff transmitter weighting with an optimized receiver. The effects of various design and operational parameters are indicated. The performance of pulse-burst radar is qualitatively compared to that of conventional low and high PRF Doppler radar. It is concluded that pulse-burst radar offers the possibility of achieving a solution to the MTI problem under operational conditions where conventional Doppler radars fail.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "486", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "498", "date_publication": "May 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "486 - 498", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
