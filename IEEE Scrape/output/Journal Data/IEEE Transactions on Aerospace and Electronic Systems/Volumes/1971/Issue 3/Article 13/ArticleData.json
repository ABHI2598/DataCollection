The optimal open-loop controls are synthesized by a proposed gradient technique which provides for the selection of desired changes in physically meaningful parameters during each iteration step. The suboptimal closed-loop controls are synthesized as integral mean-square approximations to the optimal open-loop controls over the minimum time-to- climb interval. Piecewiseconstant feedback gains and switching times are synthesized for multidimensional control vectors which are linear combinations of observable states. Several computational results are presented for optimal and suboptimal minimum time controls with constrained and unconstrained terminal flight-path angles.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "506", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "520", "date_publication": "May 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "506 - 520", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Louis R.
