An inertial reference assembly ( IRA) which embodies the aforementioned characteristics was developed recently. Pulse rebalanced gas-bearing gyroscopes were used to attain high accuracy and long life. Temperature compensation of gyroscope parameters (in lieu of temperature control) and dual voltage spinmotor operation helped achieve low-power operation. The latter two items represent an advancement in the state of the art and form the subject of this paper. These techniques were used in the construction of a three-axis IRA with an operating power less than 50 watts. It has achieved 0.1 percent scale factor accuracy over a 60\u00c2\u00b0F range.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "544", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "549", "date_publication": "May 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "544 - 549", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
