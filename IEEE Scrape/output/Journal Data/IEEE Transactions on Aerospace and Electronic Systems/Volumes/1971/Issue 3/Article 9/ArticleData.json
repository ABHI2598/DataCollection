The first is to obtain a sampled data model of a gated phase-locked loop. Data from measurements made on an actual loop constructed in the laboratory are included, and the good agreement between measured and calculated results serves as a verification of the model. Second, with the aid of the model, some of the basic operating properties of the system will be presented. Third, comparisons will be made between gated and continuous loop operation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "469", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "477", "date_publication": "May 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "469 - 477", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Barry R.
