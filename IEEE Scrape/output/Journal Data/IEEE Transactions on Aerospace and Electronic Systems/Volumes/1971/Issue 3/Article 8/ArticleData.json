Often problems associated with phenomena such as fading or reflection of the transmitted signal at an ionospheric layer, and also situations involving sampling, gating, or amplitude modulation, can be cast into such formulation. The different kinds of estimation problems treated include one-stage prediction, filtering, and smoothing. Algorithms are presented for discrete time as well as for continuous time estimation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "462", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "468", "date_publication": "May 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "462 - 468", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
