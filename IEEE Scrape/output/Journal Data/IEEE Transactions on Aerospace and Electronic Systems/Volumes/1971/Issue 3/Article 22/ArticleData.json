The method of calculating FM distortion requires the solution of a finite set of linear equations which is accomplished readily by a digital computer. To illustrate the use of the method, the FM distortion introduced by a Chebyshev-response bandpass filter is calculated for a range of network and input signal parameters.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "556", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "561", "date_publication": "May 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "556 - 561", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["O.
