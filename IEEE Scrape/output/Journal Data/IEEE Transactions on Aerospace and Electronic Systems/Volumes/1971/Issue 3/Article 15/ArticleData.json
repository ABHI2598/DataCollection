Microcircuits have been used in low power logic circuits for nearly ten years, but only recently have these techniques been applied to power subsystem circuits which operate at higher power levels. Thick film microcircuit techniques have been utilized in a dc-to-dc converter reducing weight by 70 percent, volume by 80 percent, and interconnections by 75 percent. The close piece-part spacing allowed short interconnections and lower dissipation, and reduced noise coupling. The developed microcircuit handled total power levels from one watt to twenty-five watts.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "528", "volume": "AES-7", "lastpage": "531", "date_publication": "May 1971", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1971", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "528 - 531", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["H.
