The methodology defined is based on the definition of test scenarios and related performance goals, which are then assumed as design constraints. Then, ESs are used to search a set of filter parameters for the chosen IMM structure, trying to fulfill all design constraints, and if not possible, gracefully relaxing those constraints. The method has been successfully applied to the design of an IMM monoradar tracker for an air traffic control (ATC) application, comparing the performance of several IMM structures. The resulting filters are compared with previous designs for similar applications, with ad-hoc parameters, and with other classical optimization methods. The proposed method enables improved filter tuning in a comprehensive and robust way.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1109", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "1122", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628092", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "1109 - 1122", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
