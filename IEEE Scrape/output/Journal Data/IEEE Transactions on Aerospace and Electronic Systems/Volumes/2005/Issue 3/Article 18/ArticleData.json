In order to reconstruct a well-focused ISAR image, a suitable selection of the echoes to be coherently processed must be provided. Such a selection can be made by defining a time window. We propose a technique for the automatic selection of the position and length of the time window that provides the ISAR image with the highest focus. The technique, namely the maximum contrast based automatic time window selection (MC-ATWS), is based on the definition of image contrast (IC). Due to the fact that the IC is a measure of the image focus, the time window is selected by maximizing the IC. The technique effectiveness is tested by using simulated and real data.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "992", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "1007", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628079", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "992 - 1007", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
