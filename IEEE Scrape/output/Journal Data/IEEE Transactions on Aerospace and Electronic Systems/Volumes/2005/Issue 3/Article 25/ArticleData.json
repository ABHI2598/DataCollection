Its recognition features are the location information of scattering centers extracted from the HRR radar echoes by the relax algorithm. The HMM is used to characterize the spatio-temporal information of a target. Several HMMs are cascaded in a chain to model the variation in the target orientation and used as classifiers. Computer simulations with the inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) data are given to demonstrate that for an open-set recognition, average class-recognition rates of 84.50% and 89.88% are achieved, respectively, under two given conditions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1067", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "1074", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628086", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "1067 - 1074", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bingnan Pei", "Zheng Bao"], "keywords": ["feature extraction", "hidden Markov models", "radar target recognition", "synthetic aperture radar", "HMM classifiers", "HRR radar echoes", "aerial targets recognition", "hidden Markov model", "inverse synthetic aperture radar", "open-set recognition", "radar signature", "radar target recognition method", "recognition features", "relax algorithm", "scattering centers", "spatio-temporal target information", "target orientation", "Computer simulation", "Data mining", "Electromagnetic scattering", "Feature extraction", "Hidden Markov models", "Matching pursuit algorithms", "Radar applications", "Radar scattering", "Target recognition", "Vector quantization", ""], "arnumber": "1541451"}
