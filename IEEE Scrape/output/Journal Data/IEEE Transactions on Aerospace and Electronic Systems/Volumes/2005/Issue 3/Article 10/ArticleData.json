Target class information, which is typically used in postprocessing, can also be used to improve data association to give better tracking accuracy. The use of target class information in data association can improve discrimination by yielding purer tracks and preserving their continuity. In this paper, we present the simultaneous use of target classification information and target kinematic information for target tracking. The approach presented integrates target class information into the data association process using the 2-D (one track list and one measurement list) as well as multiframe (one track list and multiple measurement lists) assignments. The multiframe association likelihood is developed to include the classification results based on the \"confusion matrix\" that specifies the accuracy of the target classifier. The objective is to improve association results using class information when the kinematic likelihoods are similar for different targets, i.e., there is ambiguity in using kinematic information alone. Performance comparisons with and without the use of class information in data association are presented on a ground target tracking problem. Simulation results quantify the benefits of classification-aided data association for improved target tracking, especially in the presence of association uncertainty in the kinematic measurements. Also, the benefit of 5-D (or multiframe) association versus 2-D association is investigated for different quality classifiers. The main contribution of this paper is the development of the methodology to incorporate exactly the classification information into multidimensional (multiframe) association.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "868", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "878", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628071", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "868 - 878", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Y.
