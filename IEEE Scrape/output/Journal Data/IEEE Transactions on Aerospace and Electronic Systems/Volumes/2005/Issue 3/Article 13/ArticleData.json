However, DAS is a data-independent approach which is known to suffer from low resolution and poor interference and clutter rejection capability. We present a data-adaptive imaging approach for FLGPR image formation based on APES (amplitude and phase estimation) and rank-deficient RCB (robust Capon beamforming). Due to the data-adaptive nature of both APES and RCB, our approach has better resolution and much better interference and clutter rejection capability than the standard DAS-based imaging methods. The excellent performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using experimental data collected via two FLGPR systems recently developed by PSI (Planning Systems, Inc.) and SRI (Stanford Research Institute).", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "922", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "936", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628074", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "922 - 936", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yanwei Wang", "Yijun Sun", "Jian Li", "P.
