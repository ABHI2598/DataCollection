The receiver is designed from the perspective of the time-frequency analysis. It uses an extended time-frequency representation based on the noncoherent integration of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) on which the detection system and the encoder work. The encoder includes robust frequency estimation, automatic modulation recognition, and clustering, to handle broadband and simultaneous signals and to prevent out-of-channel detections (a typical phenomenon in channelized receivers). The receiver has been evaluated for a wide range of signals and shows a good performance in terms of detection, estimation, and processing of simultaneous signals. Signals collected from real-life systems and synthetic signals have been utilized.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "879", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "898", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628072", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "879 - 898", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
