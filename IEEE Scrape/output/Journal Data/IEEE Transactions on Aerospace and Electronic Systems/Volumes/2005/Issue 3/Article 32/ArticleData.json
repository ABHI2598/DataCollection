The filtering algorithm is developed by applying the basic interacting multiple model (IMM) approach and the probabilistic data association (PDA) technique to a two sensor (radar and infrared, for instance) problem for state estimation for the target. A simultaneous measurement update approach is followed where the raw sensor measurements are passed to a central processor and fed directly to the target tracker. A multisensor PDA filter is developed for parallel sensor processing for target tracking under clutter. A past approach using parallel sensor processing has ignored certain data association probabilities leading to an inaccurate implementation. Another existing approach applies only to nonmaneuvering targets. The algorithm is illustrated via a highly maneuvering target tracking simulation example where two sensors, a radar and an infrared sensor, are used. Compared with an existing IMM/PDA filtering algorithm with sequential sensor processing, the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvement in the accuracy of track estimation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1122", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "1131", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628093", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "1122 - 1131", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Soonho Jeong", "J.
