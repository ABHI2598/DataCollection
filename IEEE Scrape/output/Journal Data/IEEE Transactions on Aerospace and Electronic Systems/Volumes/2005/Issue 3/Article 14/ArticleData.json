Upon a sectorization of the coverage area, the received echoes are jointly processed in the azimuth-range-Doppler domain and in the time domain through a Viterbi-like algorithm that exploits the physically admissible target transitions between successive illuminations, in order to collect all of the energy back-scattered during the time on target (TOT). A reduced-complexity implementation is derived assuming, at the design stage, that the target does not change resolution cell during the TOT in each scan. The constant false alarm rate (CFAR) constraint is also englobed in the proposed procedures as well as the possibility of working with quantized data. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have good detection and tracking capabilities even for high target velocities and low quantization rates.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "937", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "954", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628075", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "937 - 954", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
