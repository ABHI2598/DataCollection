In this paper, a V2-based MP point tracking (MPPT) scheme is developed using a buck-boost transformation topology. Although several buck-boost transformation topologies are available we have considered here a coupled inductor SEPIC converter for experimentation. To achieve almost ripple-free array current we have used ripple steering phenomena with the help of integrated inductor. This integrated inductor not only reduces the magnetic core requirements but also improves converter performance. Mathematical models are formulated and tracking algorithm is evolved. A combined PV system simulation model is developed in the SIMULINK. For a given solar insolation, the tracking algorithm changes the duty ratio of the converter such that the solar cell array (SCA) voltage equals the voltage corresponding to the MP point. This is done by the tracking algorithm, which mainly computes the power proportional to square of terminal voltage and changes the duty ratio of the converter so that this power is maximum. The proposed algorithm is implemented in real-time with the help of Analog Device ADMC-401 DSP evaluation module. The tracking program is developed to perform experimental investigations using analog-to-digital converter (ADC) interrupt. Using this processor we are able to track the MP within 200 ms. The proposed peak power tracking effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation and experimental results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1019", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "1029", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628081", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "1019 - 1029", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
