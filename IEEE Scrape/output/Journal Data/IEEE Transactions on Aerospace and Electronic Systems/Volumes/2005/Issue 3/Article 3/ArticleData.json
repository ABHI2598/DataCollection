The two-step optimal estimator (TSE) suggests an attractive alternative to the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF). A superior performance is accomplished by dividing the estimation problem into two steps: a linear first step and a nonlinear second step. The target tracking performance of the TSE is shown to be better than an EKF implemented in either inertial or modified spherical coordinates. In the passive case, where bearing/elevation angles only are measured, the TSE yields excellent range and target acceleration estimates. In the active case, where range measurement is available as well, a homing missile employing closed-loop optimal guidance based on the TSE state estimates obtains smaller miss distances than with either versions of the EKF.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "780", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "793", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628064", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "780 - 793", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
