The errors are first simply treated as a \"white\" noise sequence: we assume no correlation between the intervisibility at two different times, and the probability of an instantaneous intervisibility event is in this case developed. This is useful; but perhaps of greater concern is whether or not a target remains visible long enough and/or often enough that its motion can be tracked? Consequently, we present a second treatment in which the errors are stochastic processes of a certain bandwidth, and both the probability density function (pdf) of an intervisibility interval and the average number of intervisibility intervals over a certain time period are developed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "840", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "852", "date_publication": "July 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8628069", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "3", "pages": "840 - 852", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["X.
