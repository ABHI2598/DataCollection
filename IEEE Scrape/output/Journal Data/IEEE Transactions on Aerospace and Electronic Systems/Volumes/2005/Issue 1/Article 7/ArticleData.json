As an example of guidance problem, a model of defense scenario against reentering ballistic missile is considered. In this scenario, a maneuverable decelerating target is to be destroyed by a hit-to-kill interceptor outfitted with an infrared (IR) array seeker and lateral impulse thrusters. The key element of the proposed approach is a description of the \"interceptor-target\" system state by means of IS. The results of Monte Carlo (MC) tests of the developed algorithm are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "65", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "74", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375641", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "65 - 74", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
