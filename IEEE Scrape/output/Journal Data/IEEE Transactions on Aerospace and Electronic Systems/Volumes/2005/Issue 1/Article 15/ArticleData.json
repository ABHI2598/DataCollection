In contrast to the conventional control techniques, the principal idea of Pulse Train technique is to regulate the output voltage using a series of high and low energy pulses generated by the current of the inductor. The applicability of the proposed technique to both the input and magnetizing inductances of BIFRED converter is investigated. Analysis of BIFRED converter operating in DCM as well as the output voltage ripple estimation is given. Experimental results on a prototype converter are also presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "181", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "189", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375649", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "181 - 189", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
