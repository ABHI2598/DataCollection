In order to avoid either a delay in the output or the need for reordering and reprocessing an entire sequence of measurements, such measurements have to be processed as out-of-sequence measurements (OOSMs). Recent work developed procedures for incorporating OOSMs into a Kalman filter (KF). Since the state of the art tracker for real (maneuvering) targets is the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator, the algorithm for incorporating OOSMs into an IMM estimator is presented here. Both data association and estimation are considered. Simulation results are presented for two realistic problems using measurements from two airborne GMTI sensors. It is shown that the proposed algorithm for incorporating OOSMs into an IMM estimator yields practically the same performance as the reordering and in-sequence reprocessing of the measurements. Also, it is shown how the range rate from a GMTI sensor can be used as a linear velocity measurement in the tracking filter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "90", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "98", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375643", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "90 - 98", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Y.
