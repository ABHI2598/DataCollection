When targets are close enough together that their measurement validation gates overlap, the measurement from one target can be confused with another. Data association algorithms such as the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm can effectively continue to track targets under these conditions, but the target estimates may become biased. A modification of the covariance control approach for sensor management can reduce this effect. Sensors are chosen based on their ability to reduce the extent of measurement gate overlap as judged by a set of heuristic parameters derived in this work. Monte Carlo simulation results show that these are effective methods of reducing target estimate bias in the JPDA algorithm when targets are close together. An analysis of the computational demands of these algorithms shows that while they are computationally demanding, they are not prohibitively so.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "153", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "173", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375647", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "153 - 173", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
