This is done for the purpose of classifying the missile so that appropriate counter-measures can be taken. Mathematical models are constructed for a pursuer with a changing velocity, i.e., a direction change and a speed change. Assuming the pursuer is launched from the ground with fixed thrust, its motion can be described by a four-dimensional parameter vector consisting of its proportional navigation constant and three parameters related to thrusting. Consequently, the problem can be solved as a parameter estimation problem, rather than state estimation and we provide an estimator based on maximum likelihood (ML) to solve it. The parameter estimates obtained can be mapped into the time-to-go until intercept estimation results are presented for different scenarios together with the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), which quantifies the best achievable estimation accuracy. The accuracy of the time-to-go estimate is also obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator is efficient by meeting the CRLB.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "190", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "204", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375650", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "190 - 204", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["L.
