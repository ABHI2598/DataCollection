Depending on the measurement set, different passive tracking procedures result: angle-only tracking (AOT), frequency-only tracking (FOT), and angle/frequency tracking (AFT). Whereas the two-dimensional passive tracking problem has been solved for a multitude of scenarios, thus giving a good insight into the parametric dependences, the three-dimensional problem has been discussed only in a few specific cases. To get a deeper insight into the parametric dependences of three-dimensional TMA, this work analyzes AOT and AFT in typical three-dimensional Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) scenarios. A Cramer Rao (CR) analysis of the problem reveals the parametric dependences of both methods and gives a clear idea of the increase in estimation accuracy by using AFT instead of AOT. The results obtained in this way are well confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations taking maximum likelihood (ML) as estimation procedure.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "284", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "301", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375656", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "284 - 301", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["K.
