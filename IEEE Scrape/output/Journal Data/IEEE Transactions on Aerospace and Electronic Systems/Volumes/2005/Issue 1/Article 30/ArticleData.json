The present work shows that both properties are maintained when a binary orthogonal overlay is replaced by its \"derivative phase\" (DP) frequency modulation (FM) equivalent. Frequency modulated overlay is more spectrum efficient and would be easier to implement when the original pulses are already frequency modulated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "372", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "382", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375664", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "372 - 382", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["N.
