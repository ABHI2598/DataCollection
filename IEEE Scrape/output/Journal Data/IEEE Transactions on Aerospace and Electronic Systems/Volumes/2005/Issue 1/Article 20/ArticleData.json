A set of particle filtering methods for tracking and manoeuvering target in clutter from angle-only measurements is presented and evaluated. The aim is to compare PFs to a well-established tracking algorithm, the IMM-PDA-EKF (interacting multiple model, probabilistic data association, extended Kalman filter), and to provide an insight into which aspects of PF design are of most importance under given conditions. Monte Carlo simulations show that the use of a resampling scheme which produces particles with distinct values offers significant improvements under almost all conditions. Interestingly, under all conditions considered here,using this resampling scheme with blind particle proposals is shown to be superior, in the sense of providing improved performance for a fixed computational expense, to measurement-directed particle proposals with the same resampling scheme. This occurs even under conditions favourable to the use of measurement-directed proposals. The IMM-PDA-EKF performs poorly compared with the PFs for large clutter densities but is more effective when the measurements are precise.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "252", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "270", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375654", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "252 - 270", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
