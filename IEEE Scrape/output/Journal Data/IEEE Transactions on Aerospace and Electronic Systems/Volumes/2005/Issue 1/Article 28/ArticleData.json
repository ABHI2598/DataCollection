For modeling purposes, we chose the real-time delivery of high resolution weather maps to the cockpit as a particularly demanding future application. Focusing on this application, we investigate the use of low and geosynchronous Earth orbit (LEO and GEO) satellite networks for efficient delivery of the data. We propose a joint uni-cast and broadcast communication technique that offers bandwidth reduction. We quantify our results through simulation and compare the techniques with other methods.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "361", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "370", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375662", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "361 - 370", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["O.
