The optimal combined sequence minimizes a tracking performance index under a set of parameter constraints. The performance index includes the probability of track loss and a function of estimation error covariances. The track loss probability and the error covariances are predicted using a hybrid conditional average algorithm. The effect of the false alarms and clutter interference is taken into account in the prediction. A measurement model in explicit form is also presented which is developed based on the resolution cell in the delay-Doppler plane for a single Gaussian pulse. Numerical experiments were performed to solve the optimization problem for several examples.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375637", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "17 - 33", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Sun-Mog Hong", "R.
