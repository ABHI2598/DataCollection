In these applications with low-voltage large-current sources, the full-bridge circuit is the most attractive topology due to the possibility of using low-voltage high-performance metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) and achieving high efficiency of the dc-dc power converter. A tapped-inductor filter including the freewheeling diode is newly implemented in the output stage of the full-bridge phase-shift PWM dc-dc converter to achieve soft-switching operation for the wide load variation range. Moreover, in the proposed converter circuit, the circulating current is effectively minimized without using additional resonant circuit and auxiliary power switching devices. The practical effectiveness of the proposed soft-switching dc-dc power converter was verified in laboratory level experiment with 1 kW 100 kHz breadboard setup using power MOSFETs. Actual efficiency of 94-97% was obtained for the wide duty cycle and load variation ranges.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "174", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "180", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8375648", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "174 - 180", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
