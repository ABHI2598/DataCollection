A variable structure controller based on sliding modes is obtained first, which guarantees global exponential stability under actuator constraints, uncertainties, and failures. The design is based on a continuous average-proportional torque selection function and a set of feasible sliding surfaces, which may be adapted to improve performance. Exponential convergence towards ultimate bounds is guaranteed when all other practical issues arise.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "584", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "598", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491385", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "584 - 598", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
