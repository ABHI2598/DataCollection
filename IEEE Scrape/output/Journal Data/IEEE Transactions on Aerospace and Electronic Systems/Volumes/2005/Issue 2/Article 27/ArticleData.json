The proposed approach is applicable when class-conditioned densities of feature/attribute measurements are known only partially, as subjective models of a potential \"betting\" behaviour. Prior class probabilities may also be unknown. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate how the proposed approach is more cautious in decision making and produces very different results from those obtained using the Bayesian classifier.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "574", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "583", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491384", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "574 - 583", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["B.
