An estimate of the performance of the OOSM particle filter (OOSM-PF) is obtained for bearings-only tracking scenarios with a single target and a small number of sensors. These performance estimates are then compared with the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the state estimate rms error and similar performance estimates obtained from the oosm extended Kalman filter (OOSM-EKF) algorithms recently introduced in the literature. For a mildly nonlinear bearings-only tracking problem the OOSM-PF and OOSM-EKF are shown to achieve broadly similar performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "693", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "702", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491393", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "693 - 702", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
