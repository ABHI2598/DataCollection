Such reduced state Kalman filters have also been used as component filters of interacting multiple model (IMM) estimators. These reduced state Kalman filters rely on white plant noise to compensate for not knowing the maneuver - they are not necessarily optimal reduced state estimators nor are they necessarily consistent. To be consistent, the state estimation and innovation covariances must include the actual errors during a maneuver. Blair and Bar-Shalom have shown an example where a linear Kalman filter used as an inconsistent reduced state estimator paradoxically yields worse errors with multisensor tracking than with single sensor tracking. We provide examples showing multiple facets of Kalman filter and IMM inconsistency when tracking maneuvering targets with single and multiple sensors. An optimal reduced state estimator derived in previous work resolves the consistency issues of linear Kalman filters and IMM estimators.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "608", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "619", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491387", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "608 - 619", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
