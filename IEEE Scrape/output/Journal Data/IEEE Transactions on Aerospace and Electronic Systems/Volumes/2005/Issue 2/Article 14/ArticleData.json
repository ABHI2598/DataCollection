Communication load is a significant concern, and the goal of this paper is to propose an architecture for low-bandwidth track fusion. The scheme involves intelligent scalar and vector quantization of the local state estimates and of the associated estimation error covariance matrices. Simulation studies indicate that the communication saving can be quite significant, with only minor degradation of track accuracy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "671", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "681", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491391", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "671 - 681", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["covariance matrices", "sensor fusion", "target tracking", "vector quantisation", "communication load", "estimation error covariance matrices", "local state estimates", "multisensor tracking systems", "quantization architecture", "scalar quantization", "track fusion", "vector quantization", "Bandwidth", "Covariance matrix", "Distortion measurement", "Intelligent sensors", "Quantization", "Random variables", "Sensor fusion", "Sensor systems", "State estimation", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "1468756"}
