The processor worked and performed successfully both under normal and under solar flare conditions in 800 km altitude polar orbit. During a solar flare, the occurrence of single events increased by a factor of more than four compared with normal conditions. The area where single events occurred during the solar flare spread to the polar region, whereas normally they are limited to the region of South-Atlantic anomalies (SAA). Our results suggest that the performance of our COTS processor is sufficient for future space applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "599", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "607", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491386", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "599 - 607", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
