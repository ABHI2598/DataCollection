To process the received signal with serious dilation, a new technique called dilation dependent matched filtering (DDMF) is proposed to combine with the two-dimensional space frequency interpolation wavefront reconstruction (SFIWR) method. The DDMF-SFIWR method can effectively eliminate the impact of dilation when the illuminated area is relatively small, as verified by simulations and acoustic experiments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "729", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "736", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491398", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "729 - 736", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yonghong Zeng", "Zhiping Lin", "Guoan Bi", "J.
