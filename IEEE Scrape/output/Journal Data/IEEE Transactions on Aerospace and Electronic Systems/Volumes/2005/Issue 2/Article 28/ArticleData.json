In the absence of a satellite maneuver, it is shown that a monitor based on the projection of previously validated ephemeris parameters is adequate to meet navigation integrity and availability requirements. After scheduled stationkeeping maneuvers, no previously validated ephemerides are available, so a measurement-based method is required. The feasibility of such a monitor is also established.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "449", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "460", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491375", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "449 - 460", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["B.
