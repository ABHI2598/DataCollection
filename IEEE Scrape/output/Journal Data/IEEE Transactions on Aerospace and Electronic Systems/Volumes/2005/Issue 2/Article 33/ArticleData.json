Further developments of the FRACTA algorithm are presented here in which the focus is on the robust, efficient implementation of the FRACTA algorithm. Enhancements to the FRACTA algorithm include a censoring stopping mechanism, an alternative data blocking approach for adaptive power residue (APR) censoring, and a fast reiterative censoring (RC) procedure. Furthermore, a coherent processing interval (CPI) segmentation scheme for computing the adaptive weights is presented as an alternative approach to computing the adaptive matched filter (AMF) weight vector that allows for lower sample support and reduced computational complexity. The enhanced FRACTA algorithm, denoted as FRACTA.E, is applied to the KASSPER I challenge datacube which possesses dense ground target clusters that are known to have a significant deleterious effect on standard adaptive matched filtering (AMF) processors. It is shown that the FRACTA.E algorithm outperforms and is considerably more computationally efficient than both the original FRACTA algorithm and the standard sliding window processing (SWP) approach. Furthermore, using the KASSPER I datacube, the FRACTA.E algorithm is shown to have the same detection performance as the clairvoyant algorithm where the exact range-dependent clutter covariance matrices are known.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "537", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "548", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491381", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "537 - 548", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
