If range resolution requirements are fixed, it is of interest to compare the detectability of equal-bandwidth/equal-energy waveforms regardless of their time duration. Relative detection ranges are predicted, via computer simulation, for two types of transmitted waveforms: a benchmark rectangular pulse and a Welti binary coded waveform. The waveforms will be detected by square-law, delay and multiply, wideband, and channelized passive receivers possessing typical bandwidth, noise-floor, and loss parameters. A comparison is given showing the relative low probability of intercept and low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) attributes of each waveform and the relative detection attributes of each receiver.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "746", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "751", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491400", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "746 - 751", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["F.
