First, an ideal feedback linearization control law is designed based on the backstepping technique. Then, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) controller is designed to be the main tracking controller of the proposed RFNN control system to mimic an ideal feedback linearization control law, and a robust controller is proposed to confront the shortcoming of the FNN controller. Moreover, to relax the requirement for the bound of uncertainty term, which comprises a minimum approximation error, optimal parameter vectors and higher order terms in Taylor series, an adaptive bound estimation is investigated where a simple adaptive algorithm is utilized to estimate the bound of uncertainty. Furthermore, the simulated and experimental results due to periodic reference trajectories demonstrate that the dynamic behaviors of the proposed control systems are robust with regard to uncertainties.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "620", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "644", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8491388", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "620 - 644", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Faa-Jeng Lin", "Po-Hung Shen", "Rong-Fong Fung"], "keywords": ["feedback", "fuzzy control", "linear motors", "machine control", "neural nets", "permanent magnet motors", "position control", "robust control", "synchronous motor drives", "PMLSM drive", "RFNN control", "Taylor series", "adaptive algorithm", "adaptive bound estimation", "approximation error", "backstepping technique", "ideal feedback linearization control law", "periodic reference trajectories", "permanent magnet linear synchronous motor", "position control", "robust controller", "robust fuzzy neural network", "tracking controller", "uncertainty bound", "Backstepping", "Control systems", "Fuzzy control", "Fuzzy neural networks", "Linear feedback control systems", "Neurofeedback", "Robust control", "Synchronous motors", "Trajectory", "Uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "1468753"}
