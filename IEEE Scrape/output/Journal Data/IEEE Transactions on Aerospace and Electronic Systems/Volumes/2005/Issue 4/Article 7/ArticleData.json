However, efficiency and reliability remain key issues and the availability of new active pixel cameras requires new approaches. Two novel algorithms for recursive mode star identification are presented here. The first approach is derived by the spherical polygon search (SP-search) algorithm, it was used to access all the cataloged stars observed by the sensor field-of-view (FOV) and recursively add/remove candidate cataloged stars according to the predicted image motion induced by camera attitude dynamics. Star identification is then accomplished by a star pattern matching technique which identifies the observed stars in the reference catalog. The second method uses star neighborhood information and a catalog neighborhood pointer matrix to access the star catalog. In the recursive star identification process, and under the assumption of \"slow\" attitude dynamics, only the stars in the neighborhood of previously identified stars are considered for star identification in the succeeding frames. Numerical tests are performed to validate the absolute and relative efficiency of the proposed methods.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1246", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "1254", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8710632", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1246 - 1254", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
