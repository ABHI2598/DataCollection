This nonBayesian approach dynamically partitions a target track into a sequence of track segments, making hard estimates of when the target's maneuvering mode transitions occur, and then estimates the parameters of the target model for each segment. STI is compared with two variable structures interacting multiple model (VS-IMM) algorithms through simulations, where it is shown to have a three fold performance advantage in median absolute turn rate estimation errors, as well as better position estimation for very highly maneuvering targets. STI is also shown to outperform a Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) fixed-interval smoother when estimates are retrospectively derived, and STI accurately characterize the temporal pattern of maneuvers.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1168", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "1177", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8710628", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1168 - 1177", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
