This subsystem constitutes a fully representative branch of the qualification-model version (QM). It includes waveguide to microstrip transition, GaAs pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (PHEMT) low noise amplifiers (LNA), bandpass filter, square-law detector and dc amplifier. The fundamentals of the design of the RF part are described and all of the components have been tested individually before integration. Using single tone and wideband noise stimuli, the output voltage has been measured for several input powers, in order to obtain the sensitivity factor of the complete BEM. The effective bandwidth and the equivalent noise temperature have been calculated from the measurements, taking into account the frequency dependence on the noise source and the BEM. Finally, the low frequency output power spectrum has been obtained and a maximum 1/f knee frequency around 200 Hz has been measured with a 3 dB output signal video bandwidth above 50 KHz.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1415", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "1430", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8710640", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1415 - 1430", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["B.
