Specifically, it has been shown that for a wide class of parameter estimation problems (e.g. for objects with deterministic dynamics) the matrix CRLB, with both measurement origin uncertainty (i.e., in the presence of false alarms or random clutter) and measurement noise, is simply that without measurement origin uncertainty times a scalar information reduction factor (IRF). Conversely, there has arisen a neat expression for the CRLB for state estimation of a stochastic dynamic nonlinear system (i.e., objects with a stochastic motion); but this is only valid without measurement origin uncertainty. The present paper can be considered a marriage of the two topics: the clever Riccati-like form from the latter is preserved, but it includes the IRF from the former. The effects of plant and observation dynamics on the CRLB are explored. Further, the CRLB is compared via simulation to two common target tracking algorithms, the probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) and the multiframe (N-D) assignment algorithm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1154", "volume": "41", "lastpage": "1167", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8710627", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1154 - 1167", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Xin Zhang", "P.
