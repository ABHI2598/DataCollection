Most of these signals, spontaneously emitted from on-board mode S transponders at a fixed carrier frequency, arrive randomly at the receiving station, as well as many mode A/C replies from legacy transponders still in use. Several SSR signals are, then, overlapped in multiple aircraft situations. Therefore, the aim of this work is the separation of overlapped SSR signals, i.e., signals superimposed in time at receiving stations. We improve the MLAT receiving station by replacing the single antenna by an array of m elements and using array signal processing techniques. In the literature, several algorithms address the general source separation problem, but a very few of them are specifically designed for a mixture of overlapping SSR replies. Unfortunately, all of them have either some shortcomings, or an expensive computational cost, or no simple practical implementation. In this paper, we use the time sparsity property of the sources to propose more reliable, simpler, and more effective algorithms based on projection techniques to separate multiple SSR signals. Real recorded signals in a live environment are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "965", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "982", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10880988", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "965 - 982", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Nicolas Petrochilos", "Gaspare Galati", "Emilio Piracci"], "keywords": ["aircraft communication", "array signal processing", "radar signal processing", "SSR signals", "array processing", "cooperating aircraft", "multilateration systems", "secondary surveillance radar", "time sparsity property", "Airborne radar", "Aircraft", "Airports", "Antenna arrays", "Array signal processing", "Frequency", "Signal processing", "Signal processing algorithms", "Surveillance", "Transponders", ""], "arnumber": "5259177"}
