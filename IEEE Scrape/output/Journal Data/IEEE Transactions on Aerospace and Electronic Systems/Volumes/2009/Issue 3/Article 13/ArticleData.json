A comparative study is conducted to assess the effectiveness in the identification process between using HRR profiles and SAR images as target signatures. The results indicate that HRR profiles are just as viable as SAR image for identification. Furthermore, a score-level multi-look fusion identification method has been investigated. It is found that a correct accurate identification rate of greater than 99 percent, a low false alarm rate, and a high level of identification confidence can be achieved, providing very robust performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1017", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1039", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10890514", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "1017 - 1039", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
