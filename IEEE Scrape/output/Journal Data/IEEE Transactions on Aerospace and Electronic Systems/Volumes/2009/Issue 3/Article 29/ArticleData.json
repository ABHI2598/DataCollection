A common feature of these new modulations is the presence of two channels, the data and pilot components, that separately carry the navigation message and the ranging information. Three different techniques, noncoherent combining, coherent combining with sign recovery and differentially coherent combining, are analyzed for the joint acquisition of data and pilot signals. For each acquisition strategy the probabilities of detection and false alarm are provided. In particular closed-form expressions for the probabilities of coherent channel combining and of the differentially coherent integration strategy are derived. To the best of our knowledge these expressions are new. Monte Carlo simulations are used to support theoretical analysis demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed models.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1227", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1240", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10890521", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "1227 - 1240", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Daniele Borio", "Cillian O'Driscoll", "Gerard Lachapelle"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "Monte Carlo methods", "Chinese Compass", "European Galileo", "GPS", "Monte Carlo simulations", "closed-form expressions", "composite GNSS signals", "data signals", "detection probabilities", "differentially coherent combining techniques", "global navigation satellite systems", "navigation message", "noncoherent combining", "pilot signals", "ranging information", "Boosting", "Closed-form solution", "Frequency estimation", "Global Positioning System", "Limiting", "Phase locked loops", "Satellite navigation systems", "Signal analysis", "Spread spectrum communication", "Time measurement", ""], "arnumber": "5259196"}
