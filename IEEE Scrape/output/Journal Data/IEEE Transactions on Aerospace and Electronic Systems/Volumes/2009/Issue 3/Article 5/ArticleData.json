To obtain an optimum utilization of radio resource, without renouncing to QoS satisfaction, a suitable call admission control scheme must be implemented. Nevertheless, transmission control protocol (TCP) behavior, mainly affected by the high latency and shadowing events, can impact call admission control (CAC) performance. Therefore, it would be desirable that the CAC scheme takes into account also the TCP congestion window real evolution. We present an innovative CAC scheme that uses TCP statistics as one of its inputs and is able to manage different classes of users. Results show that CAC performance is significantly improved by introducing TCP statistics about network congestion as an input parameter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "885", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "898", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10880986", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "885 - 898", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
