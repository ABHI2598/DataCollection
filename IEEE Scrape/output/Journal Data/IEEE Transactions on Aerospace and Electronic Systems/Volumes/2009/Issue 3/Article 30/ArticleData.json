The relationship between the LPFT and Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) is derived and theoretical analysis on the SNR achieved by using the LPFT is given. Comparisons on the SNR performances achieved by using the LPFT, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and the Fourier transform (FT) are presented to illustrate the merits of using the LPFT. Measures are also taken to minimize the required computational complexity by reducing the overlap length between adjacent segments of input data. Simulation results of processing radar data show the performance improvements achieved by using the LPFT.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1241", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1248", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10881000", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "1241 - 1248", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Xiumei Li", "Guoan Bi", "Yingtuo Ju"], "keywords": ["Fourier transforms", "radar imaging", "synthetic aperture radar", "ISAR imaging", "LPFT", "Wigner-Ville distribution", "local polynomial Fourier transform", "quantitative SNR analysis", "quantitative analysis", "short-time Fourier transform", "signal-to-noise ratio", "Computational modeling", "Fourier transforms", "Image analysis", "Image segmentation", "Interference", "Polynomials", "Radar imaging", "Signal analysis", "Signal resolution", "Signal to noise ratio", ""], "arnumber": "5259197"}
