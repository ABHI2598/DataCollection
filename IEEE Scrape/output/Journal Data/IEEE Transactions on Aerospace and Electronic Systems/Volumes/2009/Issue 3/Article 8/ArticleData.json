This algorithm is able to detect thin obstacles such as cables, power lines, and wires. The system is intended to be used during urban search and rescue operations, capable of dealing with low-quality images, robust to image clutter, bad weather, and sensor artifacts. The detection process uses motion estimation at the pixel level, combined with edge detection, followed by a windowed Hough transform. The evidence of lines is tracked over time in the resulting parameter spaces using a dynamic line movement model. The algorithm's receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) is shown, based on a multi-site dataset with 86 videos with 10160 wires spanning in 5576 frames.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "937", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "949", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10880987", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "937 - 949", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Joshua Candamo", "Rangachar Kasturi", "Dmitry Goldgof", "Sudeep Sarkar"], "keywords": ["Hough transforms", "edge detection", "motion estimation", "video signal processing", "dynamic line movement model", "edge detection", "low altitude aerial vehicles", "low altitude aircraft", "low quality video", "motion estimation", "receiver operating characteristic curve", "thin line detection algorithm", "urban search and rescue operation", "windowed Hough transform", "Aircraft", "Cables", "Detection algorithms", "Image edge detection", "Image sensors", "Robustness", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Sensor systems", "Vehicles", "Wires", ""], "arnumber": "5259175"}
