The PHD filter admits a closed-form solution for a linear Gaussian multi-target model. However, this model is not general enough to accommodate maneuvering targets that switch between several models. In this paper, we generalize the notion of linear jump Markov systems to the multiple target case to accommodate births, deaths, and switching dynamics. We then derive a closed-form solution to the PHD recursion for the proposed linear Gaussian jump Markov multi-target model. Based on this an efficient method for tracking multiple maneuvering targets that switch between a set of linear Gaussian models is developed. An analytic implementation of the PHD filter using statistical linear regression technique is also proposed for targets that switch between a set of nonlinear models. We demonstrate through simulations that the proposed PHD filters are effective in tracking multiple maneuvering targets.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "919", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "936", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10890512", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "919 - 936", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Syed Ahmed Pasha", "Ba-Ngu Vo", "Hoang Duong Tuan", "Wing-Kin Ma"], "keywords": ["Gaussian processes", "Markov processes", "filtering theory", "regression analysis", "sensor fusion", "target tracking", "Gaussian mixture PHD filter", "PHD recursion", "closed-form solution", "data association uncertainty", "detection uncertainty", "jump Markov system models", "linear Gaussian multitarget model", "maneuvering targets", "multiple maneuvering target tracking", "probability hypothesis density filter", "statistical linear regression technique", "time-varying number", "Australia Council", "Closed-form solution", "Linear regression", "Motion detection", "Nonlinear filters", "State estimation", "Switches", "Target tracking", "Time varying systems", "Uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "5259174"}
