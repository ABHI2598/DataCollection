It is shown that the same model proves useful even in the cases of higher attitude uncertainty, if it is combined with suitable adaptive techniques. In this paper, Doppler ambiguity resolution is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem over a domain of integer values that are directly related to the attitude uncertainty. A test statistic is derived from the entire SAR scene using data adaptive processing. A broad class of such adaptive algorithms is analyzed in a unified way, starting from the range-azimuth coupling in the frequency domain and multilook techniques. The analysis includes two well-known and two new multilook methods for Doppler ambiguity resolution. A suitable test statistic is proposed for each of these methods and its dependency on the scene spatial correlation is discussed. Experimental results confirm the robustness of the combined scheme.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "869", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "884", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10880985", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "869 - 884", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Marina V.
