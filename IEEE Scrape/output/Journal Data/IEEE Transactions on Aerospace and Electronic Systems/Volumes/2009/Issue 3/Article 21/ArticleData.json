An induction generator (IG) operating at high frequencies is an excellent option for obtaining high power and energy densities. Various design aspects affect the operating characteristics of the machine. The effects and consequences of specific trade-offs in the design process are explored. The methodology is helpful in evaluating specific choices for materials as well as machine configurations. Use of power semiconductor devices and other power electronic devices is avoided to provide immunity from radiation and electromagnetic interference.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1126", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1137", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10880995", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "1126 - 1137", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Sushant P.
