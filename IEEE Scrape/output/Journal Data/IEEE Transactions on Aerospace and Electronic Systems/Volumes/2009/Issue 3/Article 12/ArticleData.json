However the GM-PHD filter does not provide identities of individual target state estimates, that are needed to construct tracks of individual targets. In this paper, we propose a new multi-target tracker based on the GM-PHD filter, which gives the association amongst state estimates of targets over time and provides track labels. Various issues regarding initiating, propagating and terminating tracks are discussed. Furthermore, we also propose a technique for resolving identities of targets in close proximity, which the PHD filter is unable to do on its own.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1003", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1016", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10880990", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "1003 - 1016", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kusha Panta", "Daniel E.
