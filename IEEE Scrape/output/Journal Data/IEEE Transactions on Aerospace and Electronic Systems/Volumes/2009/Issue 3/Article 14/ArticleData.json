Spatial separation has several operational advantages, such as reduced vulnerability in military applications and increased radar cross section (RCS); which may increase the capability, reliability, and flexibility of future aerospace remote sensing missions. However, in this configuration, there is no cancellation of reference oscillator phase noise as in monostatic cases. There are additional technical problems associated with temporal synchronization of the transmit and receive systems. Therefore, highly accurate time and phase synchronization must be provided. Little work on these challenges has been reported. This paper presents a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based technique for achieving successful time and phase synchronization for DiSAR. This technique offers high-frequency stability. More importantly, residual time synchronization errors may be compensated for with a high-precision range alignment method, and residual phase synchronization errors may be compensated for with a subaperture autofocus algorithm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1040", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1051", "date_publication": "July 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10890515", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "1040 - 1051", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Wen-Qin Wang"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "radar cross-sections", "synthetic aperture radar", "GPS", "Global Positioning System", "bistatic SAR", "distributed SAR", "distributed synthetic aperture radar", "high frequency stability", "multistatic SAR", "radar cross section", "residual phase synchronization error", "residual time synchronization error", "subaperture autofocus algorithm", "Aperture antennas", "Global Positioning System", "Oscillators", "Phase noise", "Radar antennas", "Radar cross section", "Receiving antennas", "Remote sensing", "Synthetic aperture radar", "Transmitting antennas", ""], "arnumber": "5259181"}
