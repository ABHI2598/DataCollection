To produce a practical tracking filter, the growth of components must be controlled by approximating the mixture distribution. Two mixture reduction schemes (a joining algorithm and a clustering algorithm) have been derived for this purpose. If significant well spaced mixture components are present, these techniques can provide a useful improvement over the probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) approach, which reduces the mixture to a single Gaussian component at each time step. For the standard problem of tracking a point target in uniform random clutter, a Monte Carlo simulation study has been employed to identify the region of the problem parameter space where significant performance improvement is obtained over the PDAF. In the second part of this paper, the formal Bayesian filter is derived for an extended target consisting of an array of measurement sources with association uncertainty. A practical multiple hypothesis filter is implemented using mixture reduction and simulation results are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "667", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "686", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720731", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "667 - 686", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
