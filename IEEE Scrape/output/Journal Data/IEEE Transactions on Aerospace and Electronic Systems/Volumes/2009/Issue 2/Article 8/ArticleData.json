However its recognition rate decreases rapidly when the position and magnitude noise increases in the star image. In order to overcome this problem, a modified grid algorithm called the \"elastic gray grid algorithm\" is proposed. Gray pattern and elastic template matching are introduced into the grid algorithm to enhance its ability to tolerate the position and magnitude noise. Experimental results show that the modified grid algorithm performs better compared with the original one. The elastic gray grid algorithm reached up to a 100% recognition rate under random positional noise in our test bed. Furthermore it increases the original recognition rate from 69.86% to 97%, under the same condition, for both the position and the magnitude noise.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "516", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "522", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720721", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "516 - 522", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Meng Na", "Danian Zheng", "Peifa Jia"], "keywords": ["image recognition", "star trackers", "all-sky autonomous star identification", "elastic gray grid algorithm", "elastic template matching", "gray pattern", "random positional noise", "recognition rate", "star image", "Computer science", "Image recognition", "Instruments", "Intelligent systems", "Pattern matching", "Pattern recognition", "Position measurement", "Research and development", "Space technology", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "5089538"}
