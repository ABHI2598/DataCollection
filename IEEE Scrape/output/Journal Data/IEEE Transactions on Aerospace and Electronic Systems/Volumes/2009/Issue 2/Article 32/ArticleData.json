Some work has been done on the performance evaluation of SCPS-TP in comparison with TCP. However, those works have been done by testing SCPS-TP via emulation test-beds. We present the file transfer experimental work of testing the SCPS protocol stack over NASA's geostationary orbit (GEO) Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS). Considering that space communication channels in practice are frequently asymmetric in terms of channel bandwidth, our work is concentrated on the evaluation of the effectiveness of SCPS-TP in coping with channel rate asymmetry. We conclude that SCPS-TP is better suited than TCP over long-delayed, asymmetric, satellite channels with a throughput advantage of over 30 Kbyte/s for the transmission of a 10 Mbyte file. A hybrid of the channel rate control and acknowledgment frequency reduction mechanisms makes significant contributions to the performance enhancement of SCPS-TP over asymmetric space channels.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "790", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "798", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720743", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "790 - 798", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ruhai Wang", "Stephen Horan"], "keywords": ["space communication links", "transport protocols", "Advanced Communications Technology Satellite", "NASA geostationary orbit", "channel bandwidth", "channel rate asymmetry", "protocol testing", "space communication channels", "space communication protocol standard", "transmission control protocol", "transport protocol", "Artificial satellites", "Bandwidth", "Communication channels", "Communication standards", "Communication system control", "Communications technology", "Emulation", "Space technology", "Testing", "Transport protocols", ""], "arnumber": "5089562"}
