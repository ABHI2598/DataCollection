In order to avoid either a delay in the output or the need for reordering and reprocessing entire sequences of measurements, such latent measurements have to be processed by the tracking filter as out-of-sequence measurements (OOSM). Recent work developed a \"one-step\" procedure for incorporating OOSM with multiple-time-step latency into the tracking filter, which, while suboptimal, was shown to yield results very close to those obtained by reordering and reprocessing an entire sequence of measurements. The counterpart of this problem is the need to remove (revocate) measurements that have already been used to update a track state. This can happen in real-world systems when such measurements are reassigned to another track. Similarly to the problem of update with an OOSM, it is desired to carry out the removal of an earlier measurement without recomputing the track estimate (and the data association) using possibly a long sequence of subsequent measurements one at a time. A one-step algorithm is presented for this problem of removing a multistep OOSM.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "612", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "619", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720726", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "612 - 619", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yaakov Bar-Shalom", "Huimin Chen"], "keywords": ["sensor fusion", "tracking filters", "data association", "distributed information processing architecture", "multisensor tracking systems", "out-of-sequence measurements", "tracking filter", "Computer architecture", "Delay", "Distributed computing", "Electric variables measurement", "Electronic mail", "Filters", "Information processing", "Sensor systems", "Target tracking", "Time measurement", ""], "arnumber": "5089544"}
