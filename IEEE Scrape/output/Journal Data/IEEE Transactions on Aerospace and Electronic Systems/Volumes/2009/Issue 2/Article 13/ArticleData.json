In particular, azimuthal measurements are assumed to be either coarse or unavailable, so that multiple sensors are required to triangulate target tracks using range and Doppler measurements only. Increasing the number of sensors can cause data association by conventional means to become impractical due to combinatorial complexity, i.e., an exponential increase in the number of mappings between signatures and target models. When the azimuthal resolution is coarse, this problem will be exacerbated by the resulting overlap between signatures from multiple targets and clutter. In the new approach, the data association is performed probabilistically, using a variation of expectation-maximization (EM). Combinatorial complexity is avoided by performing an efficient optimization in the space of all target tracks and mappings between tracks and data. The full, multi-sensor, version of the algorithm is tested on simulated data. The results demonstrate that accurate tracks can be estimated by exploiting spatial diversity in the sensor locations. Also, as a proof-of-concept, a simplified, single-sensor range-only version of the algorithm is tested on experimental radar data acquired with a stretch radar receiver. These results are promising, and demonstrate robustness in the presence of nonhomogeneous clutter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "593", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "611", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720725", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "593 - 611", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ross Deming", "John Schindler", "Leonid Perlovsky"], "keywords": ["Doppler measurement", "expectation-maximization algorithm", "optimization", "radar receivers", "sensor fusion", "target tracking", "Doppler data", "Doppler measurements", "azimuthal measurements", "combinatorial complexity", "data association", "expectation maximization", "multiple radar platforms", "multisensor tracking", "multitarget tracking", "nonhomogeneous clutter", "optimization", "radar receiver", "spatial diversity", "Clutter", "Diversity reception", "Doppler measurements", "Doppler radar", "Particle measurements", "Radar detection", "Radar tracking", "Robustness", "Target tracking", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "5089543"}
