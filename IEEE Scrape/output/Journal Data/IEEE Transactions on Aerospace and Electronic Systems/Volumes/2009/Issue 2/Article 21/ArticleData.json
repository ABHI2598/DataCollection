This problem is exacerbated as the transmitted waveform is not under control of the radar designer and the sidelobes of the ambiguity function can mask targets including those displaced in either (or both) range and Doppler from the disturbance. A novel multistage approach is developed for disturbance cancellation and target detection based on projections of the received signal in a subspace orthogonal to both the disturbance and previously detected targets. The resulting algorithm is shown to be effective against typical simulated scenarios with a limited number of stages, and a version with computational savings is also introduced. Finally its effectiveness is demonstrated with the application to real data acquired with an experimental VHF PBR system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "698", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "722", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720733", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "698 - 722", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["F.
