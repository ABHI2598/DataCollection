The probabilistic nature of the strongest neighbor (SN) measurement in a cluttered environment is shown to be varied with respect to the number of validated measurements. Incorporating the number of validated measurements into design of the PSNF produces a consistent and cost effective data association method. Simulation studies show that the new filter is less sensitive to the unknown spatial clutter density and is more reliable for practical target tracking in nonhomogeneous clutter than the existing PSNF. It has similar performances to the probabilistic data association filter amplitude information (PDAF-AI) with much less computational complexities.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "431", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "442", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720715", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "431 - 442", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Taek Lyul Song", "Young Taek Lim", "Dong Gwan Lee"], "keywords": ["costing", "filtering theory", "probability", "sensor fusion", "computational complexities", "cost effective", "data association", "probabilistic strongest neighbor filter", "validated measurements", "Computational complexity", "Computational modeling", "Contracts", "Costs", "Current measurement", "Information filtering", "Information filters", "Probability", "Target tracking", "Tin", ""], "arnumber": "5089532"}
