We seek to minimize the total system power consumption subject to detection performance constrains by carefully choosing the thresholds and positions of the sensors. Toward this goal, we propose an iterative algorithm for the optimization problem. Numerical results are given to provide insights into the design of such networks. We show that random sensor placement can perform poorly, in contrast to what many currently believe.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "555", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "563", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10757591", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "555 - 563", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Zhenyu Tu", "Rick S.
