The methodology for measuring ship flexure using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial sensors is described. Results indicate that flexure on the aircraft carrier used for testing has a standard deviation of approximately 1-2 cm. For the ship tested, the most significant flexure effects are in the port/starboard direction and correlate best with roll or lateral acceleration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "523", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "535", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720722", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "523 - 535", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Mark.
