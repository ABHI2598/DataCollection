Data recorded during channel sounding experiments, conducted over the Pacific Ocean near Point Mugu, CA was used to model the multipath propagation. The modeling results show that a three-ray model consisting of line-of-sight propagation and two reflected propagation paths is a good fit for the measured channel frequency responses. One of the reflected propagation paths is a strong specular reflection determined by the geometry defined by the airborne transmitter, the ground-based receiver, and the sea surface. For the flight profiles used, the delay of this path is between 10 and 50 ns. The other propagation path is a more diffuse, random reflection whose amplitude is significantly smaller than the amplitude of the specular reflection and whose mean excess delay is 57 ns with an rms delay spread of 25 ns.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "735", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "742", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720735", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "735 - 742", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Qiang Lei", "Michael Rice"], "keywords": ["multipath channels", "telemetry", "channel frequency responses", "channel sounding experiments", "multipath channel model", "multipath propagation model", "over-water aeronautical telemetry", "Acoustic propagation", "Frequency measurement", "Geometry", "Line-of-sight propagation", "Multipath channels", "Oceans", "Propagation delay", "Reflection", "Sea measurements", "Telemetry", ""], "arnumber": "5089553"}
