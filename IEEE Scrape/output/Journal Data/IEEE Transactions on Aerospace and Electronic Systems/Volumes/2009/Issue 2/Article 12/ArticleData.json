However, conventional SAR systems are not capable of fulfilling the increasing demands for improved spatial resolution and wider swath coverage. To overcome these inherent limitations, several innovative techniques have been suggested which employ multiple receive-apertures to gather additional information along the synthetic aperture. These digital beamforming (DBF) on receive techniques are reviewed with particular emphasis on the multi-aperture signal processing in azimuth and a multi-aperture reconstruction algorithm is presented that allows for the unambiguous recovery of the Doppler spectrum. The impact of Doppler aliasing is investigated and an analytic expression for the residual azimuth ambiguities is derived. Further, the influence of the processing on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analyzed, resulting in a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) dependent factor describing the SNR scaling of the multi-aperture beamforming network. The focus is then turned to a complete high-resolution wide-swath SAR system design example which demonstrates the intricate connection between multi-aperture azimuth processing and the system architecture. In this regard, alternative processing approaches are compared with the multi-aperture reconstruction algorithm. In a next step, optimization strategies are discussed as pattern tapering, prebeamshaping-on-receive, and modified processing algorithms. In this context, the analytic expressions for both the residual ambiguities and the SNR scaling factor are generalized to cascaded beamforming networks. The suggested techniques can moreover be extended in many ways. Examples discussed are a combination with ScanSAR burst mode operation and the transfer to multistatic sparse array configurations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "564", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "592", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720724", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "564 - 592", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Nicolas Gebert", "Gerhard Krieger", "Alberto Moreira"], "keywords": ["array signal processing", "radar imaging", "synthetic aperture radar", "Doppler aliasing", "digital beamforming", "high-resolution wide-swath SAR imaging", "pattern tapering", "prebeamshaping-on-receive", "pulse repetition frequency", "remote sensing", "synthetic aperture radar", "Array signal processing", "Azimuth", "Earth", "High-resolution imaging", "Radar polarimetry", "Reconstruction algorithms", "Remote sensing", "Signal processing algorithms", "Spatial resolution", "Synthetic aperture radar", ""], "arnumber": "5089542"}
