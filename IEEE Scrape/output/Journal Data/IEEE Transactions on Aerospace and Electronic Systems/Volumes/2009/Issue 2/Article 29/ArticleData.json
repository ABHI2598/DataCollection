Based on a new model developed in this paper, a theoretical expression for joint probability of detection for two overlapping gates is derived and confirms the excellent accuracy of Cann's empirical expression. The general principle can be applied to calculate range gate straddling loss for arbitrary gates with arbitrary correlation coefficients.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "773", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "775", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720740", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "773 - 775", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Junhao Xie", "Yinping Luo"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "probability", "Cann empirical expression", "arbitrary correlation coefficients", "arbitrary gates", "empirical equation", "joint probability", "partial correlation", "range gate straddling loss", "Equations", "Event detection", "Frequency", "Gaussian noise", "Narrowband", "Probability density function", "Random processes", "Random variables", "Sampling methods", ""], "arnumber": "5089559"}
