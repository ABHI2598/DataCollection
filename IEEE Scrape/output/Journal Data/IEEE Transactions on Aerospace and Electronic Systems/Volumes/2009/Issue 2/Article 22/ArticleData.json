Several tracking failure modes can occur; in particular, discontinuities due to platform's motion can produce the so called ego-motion failure leading to unrecoverable errors in tracking the target. A novel ego-motion compensation technique for UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) is proposed. Data received from the autopilot can be used to predict the motion of the platform, thus allowing to identify a smaller region of the image (subframe) where the candidate target has to be searched for in the next frame of the sequence. The presented methodology is compared with a recently robust algorithm for automatic target tracking; experimental results show that the proposed motion estimation approach helps to improve performance both in terms of frames processed per second (targets are searched in smaller regions) and in terms of robustness (targets are correctly tracked for all the sequence's frames).", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "723", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "734", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720734", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "723 - 734", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Andrea Sanna", "Barbara Pralio", "Fabrizio Lamberti", "Gianluca Paravati"], "keywords": ["aircraft", "image sequences", "motion estimation", "remotely operated vehicles", "target tracking", "video signal processing", "UAV", "automatic target tracking", "ego-mego-motion compensation strategyotion compensation strategy", "forward-looking infrared video sequences", "motion estimation", "unmanned aerial vehicles", "unrecoverable errors", "Aerospace control", "Aircraft", "Cameras", "Humans", "Monitoring", "Motion estimation", "Robustness", "Target tracking", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", "Video sequences", ""], "arnumber": "5089552"}
