It can be classified as a form of continuous phase modulation (CPM), but its major distinction from other CPMs is that it has a constrained (correlated) ternary data alphabet. CPM-based detection models for SOQPSK have been developed only recently. While these detectors offer an appreciable performance gain over current detection schemes, one roadblock standing in the way of their being adopted is the lack of a CPM-based symbol timing recovery scheme that will work with SOQPSK. We show how an existing CPM-based timing error detector (TED) can be adapted to the unique characteristics of SOQPSK. The TED is formulated for a coherent detector but can be extended to the noncoherent case. We apply this timing recovery method to the versions of SOQPSK used in military (MIL-STD SOQPSK) and telemetry group (SOQPSK-TG) standards. We derive the theoretical performance limits on the accuracy of timing recovery for SOQPSK, as given by the modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB), and show that the proposed decision-directed TED (DD-TED) performs close to these bounds in computer simulations and is free of false-lock points. We also show that the proposed scheme outperforms a non-data-aided TED (NDA-TED) that was recently developed for SOQPSK. These results show that the proposed scheme has great promise in a wide range of applications due to its low complexity, strong performance, and lack of false-lock points.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "781", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "789", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10720742", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "781 - 789", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Prashanth Chandran", "Erik Perrins"], "keywords": ["phase shift keying", "synchronization", "SOQPSK", "continuous phase modulation", "decision directed symbol timing recovery", "modified Cramer-Rao bound", "shaped offset quadrature phase shift keying", "ternary data alphabet", "timing error detector", "Bandwidth", "Continuous phase modulation", "Detectors", "Military computing", "Military standards", "Performance gain", "Phase modulation", "Quadrature phase shift keying", "Telemetry", "Timing", ""], "arnumber": "5089561"}
