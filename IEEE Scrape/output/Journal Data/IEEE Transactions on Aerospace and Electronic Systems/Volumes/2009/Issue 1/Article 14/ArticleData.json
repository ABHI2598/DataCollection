Further, two self-tuning weighted measurement fusion Kalman filters are presented for the multisensor systems with identical and different measurement matrices, respectively. Based on the stability of the dynamic error system, a new convergence analysis tool is presented for a self-tuning fuser, which is called the dynamic error system analysis (DESA) method. A new concept of convergence in a realization is presented, which is weaker than the convergence with probability one. It is rigorously proved that the proposed self-tuning Kalman fusers converge to the steady-state optimal Kalman fusers in a realization or with probability one, so that they have asymptotic global optimality. A simulation example for a target tracking system with 3 sensors shows their effectiveness.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "179", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "191", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546687", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "179 - 191", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yuan Gao", "Wen-Jing Jia", "Xiao-Jun Sun", "Zi-Li Deng"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "Kalman filters", "asymptotic stability", "matrix algebra", "self-adjusting systems", "sensor fusion", "asymptotic global optimality", "convergence analysis", "correlation function", "dynamic error system analysis method", "matrix equations", "multisensor systems", "self-tuning weighted measurement fusion Kalman filters", "steady-state optimal Kalman fusers", "target tracking system", "unknown noise variances", "Convergence", "Equations", "Error analysis", "Kalman filters", "Multisensor systems", "Sensor systems", "Stability analysis", "Steady-state", "Target tracking", "Weight measurement", ""], "arnumber": "4805272"}
