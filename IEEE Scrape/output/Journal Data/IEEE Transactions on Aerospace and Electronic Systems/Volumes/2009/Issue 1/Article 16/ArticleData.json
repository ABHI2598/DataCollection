We discuss a phase-coded interrupted CW (ICW) signal which is the combination of CW signal and CPT. Phase codes used here are with perfect periodic autocorrelation. The periodic ambiguity function of ICW signals is studied including single-carrier signal and multi-carrier signal. It is interesting that the gate function has different effects on two signals and contributes to a multi-carrier ICW signal which yields nearly perfect autocorrelation. Meanwhile we also suggest an efficient receiver approach to ICW signals, which can reduce the computational burden of the processor and utilize the good properties of P3 and P4 codes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "209", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "220", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546689", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "209 - 220", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Qing-Chen Xu", "Zi-Jie Yang", "Xiong Hu"], "keywords": ["phase coding", "radar signal processing", "P3 codes", "P4 codes", "autocorrelation", "coherent pulse train", "high resolution radars", "multicarrier signal", "perfect periodic autocorrelation", "periodic ambiguity function", "phase-coded interrupted CW signals", "single-carrier signal", "Autocorrelation", "Doppler shift", "Pulse compression methods", "Radar signal processing", "Signal analysis", "Signal design", "Signal processing", "Signal resolution", "Space vector pulse width modulation", "Transmitters", ""], "arnumber": "4805274"}
