The incident sources are pure-tones at distinct, deterministic but unknown frequencies, in contrast to the case of all incident sources at one common known frequency, as has been investigated in the existing research literature on the CRB for diversely-polarized direction-finding. The derived CRBs are closed-form expressions, explicitly in terms of the signal parameters. The new CRBs presented here reveal how a constituent dipole and/or loop's presence and orientation may affect estimation precision, thereby offering guidelines to the system engineer on what dipole(s) and/or loop(s) to include or to omit in constructing the electromagnetic vector-sensor.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "94", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "109", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546681", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "94 - 109", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Chun Kin Au-Yeung", "Kainam Thomas Wong"], "keywords": ["electromagnetic devices", "electromagnetic wave polarization", "signal processing", "asymptotic Cramer-Rao lower bounds", "azimuth-elevation arrival-angles", "diversely-polarized direction-finding", "electromagnetic vector-sensor", "polarization parameters", "sinusoid-source estimation", "Amplitude estimation", "Coordinate measuring machines", "Electric variables measurement", "Electromagnetic scattering", "Electromagnetic wave polarization", "Frequency diversity", "Frequency estimation", "Navigation", "Phase estimation", "Power measurement", ""], "arnumber": "4805266"}
