We carry out a theoretical study of an indoor positioning technique based on sequential switching. It uses available global positioning System (GPS) signals and simple deployment of so-called \"GPS repeaters.\" The delay-lock loop (DLL) architecture of a GPS receiver has been modified into an open DLL to improve indoor positioning performance. A comparison study between simulation results using a standard GPS receiver and an improved one shows that the latter allows submetrical accuracy to be achieved.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "347", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "359", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546699", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "347 - 359", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Nabil Jardak", "Nel Samama"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "delay lock loops", "radio repeaters", "GPS receiver", "GPS-repeaters", "delay-lock loop architecture", "global positioning system", "indoor localization systems", "indoor positioning technique", "location-based services", "open code loop architecture", "Aerodynamics", "Computer architecture", "Delay", "Global Positioning System", "Interference", "Phase detection", "Phase measurement", "Repeaters", "Satellite navigation systems", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "4805284"}
