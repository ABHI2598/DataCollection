The Gabor filter adopts the network structure of two layers, and its input layer constitutes the adaptive nonlinear feature extraction part, whereas the weights between output layer and input layer constitute the linear classifier. From the statistic property of high-resolution range profile (HRRP), its extracted nonstationarity degree of features is tracked to extract the discriminative features of Gabor atoms. Two experimental examples show that the Gabor filter approach with simple structure has higher recognition rate in radar target recognition from HRRP as compared with several existing methods.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546677", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "17 - 30", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Feng Zhu", "Xian-Da Zhang", "Ya-Feng Hu"], "keywords": ["Gabor filters", "feature extraction", "radar signal processing", "radar target recognition", "Gabor Filter", "adaptive nonlinear feature extraction", "high-resolution range profile", "linear classifier", "radar target recognition", "Adaptive filters", "Feature extraction", "Fourier transforms", "Gabor filters", "Information science", "Pattern classification", "Radar imaging", "Target recognition", "Time frequency analysis", "Vectors", ""], "arnumber": "4805260"}
