E-logbook (electronic logbook) is a new technology designed to replace current documentation processes of space system I&T operations, such as connector mate and demate, flight hardware and flight software component installation, material mixes or electronic ground support equipment (EGSE) validation. It also includes new documentation concepts, such as the shift log, which improves project awareness and optimizes the shift hand-over process, and the configuration log, which instantly reports on the global I&T state of the space system and greatly enhances information gathering prior to major test events or project reviews. The design of E-logbook focuses not only on a reliable and efficient relational database, but also on an ergonomic human-computer interactive (HCI) system of graphical user interfaces (GUI) that can help reduce human error and improve I&T discipline and management oversight. E-Logbook has been used for the I&T of the large area telescope (LAT) of the gamma-ray large area space telescope (GLAST) scientific satellite at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). After 19 months of operation, more than 41,000 records have been created for the different documentation components or I&T logs, with no data having been corrupted or critically lost. 94% of the operators and 100% of the management exposed to E-logbook prefer it to paper logbooks and recommend its use in the aerospace industry.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "167", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "178", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546686", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "167 - 178", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Alicia T.
