As MMTs are more accurately described by a set of canonical elements than with isotropic points, we develop a new algorithm which aims at using new models, instead of the isotropic point model commonly used in SAR processors. A subspace detector matched to canonical elements is included in the SAR processing. The implementation and the optimization of subspace detector SAR (SDSAR) algorithm is described. Simple examples of MMT detection in simulations and real data with a target hidden in a forest show the power of our approach. The SDSAR algorithm is shown to be the first robust and tractable algorithm relying on realistic scattering assumptions about the target.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "221", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "236", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546690", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "221 - 236", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
