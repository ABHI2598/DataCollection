A stochastic hybrid model, validated by simulated-neutron experiments done at the NASA Langley Research Center, is used to theoretically predict the outcome of the experiment. In particular, this model predicts and the data confirms that the recoverable digital flight control system, when functioning as designed, will provide accurate output tracking performance in the presence of neutron-induced single-event upsets (SEUs) at normal atmospheric levels.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "321", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "335", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546697", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "321 - 335", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hong Zhang", "W.
