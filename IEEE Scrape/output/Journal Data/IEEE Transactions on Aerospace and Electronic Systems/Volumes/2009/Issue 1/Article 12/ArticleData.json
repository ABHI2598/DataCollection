A measurement likelihood function is derived for this situation which accounts for the effect of both positive and negative contact information. This likelihood function is approximated a? a weighted sum of Gaussian terms consisting of both positive and negative weights, accounting for the positive and negative contact information. Additionally, recent theoretical results have been reported which have derived an accurate measurement error covariance in the vicinity of the jammer when adaptive beamforming is used by the radar to null the effects of the jammer. We compare the impact of using a likelihood function that accounts for negative contact information and the corrected measurement error covariance by comparing five Kalman filter-based trackers in five different scenarios. We show that only those track filters which use both the negative contact information and the corrected measurement error covariance are effective in maintaining track on a maneuvering target as it passes through the jamming region. This approach can also be generalized to any target tracking problem where the sensor response is anisotropic.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "152", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "166", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546685", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "152 - 166", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Wayne R.
