In the light of the renewed interest in weak signal detection and considering the limitations of coherent integration, it is critical to possess a tool in order to predict and evaluate the impact of noncoherent integrations on signal detection performance. The challenge is the statistic of the noise component, preventing the computation of exact signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios when combinations of coherent and noncoherent integrations are utilized. An original approach is presented to enable this comparison through an equivalent area criterion based on the popular receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The equivalent area approach is compared with past techniques, and the performance of each method is analyzed for highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed criterion.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "360", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "375", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546700", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "360 - 375", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Daniele Borio", "Dennis Akos"], "keywords": ["satellite navigation", "signal detection", "GNSS detection", "Global Navigation Satellite System", "coherent integration", "noise component", "receiver operating characteristic curves", "signal acquisition", "signal detection", "signal-to-noise ratios", "Degradation", "Detectors", "Global Positioning System", "Performance analysis", "Satellite navigation systems", "Signal analysis", "Signal detection", "Signal processing", "Signal to noise ratio", "Statistics", ""], "arnumber": "4805285"}
