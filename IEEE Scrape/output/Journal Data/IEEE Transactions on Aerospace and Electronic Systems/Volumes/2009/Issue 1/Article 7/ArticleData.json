A simple control strategy is presented based on the idea of adjusting the SMA wire temperature as rapidly as possible. This strategy is simple, stable, and requires no hysteresis model or thermal model. The strategy is tested first on tracking displacement outputs, and effects of updating rate and input current on control accuracy are also discussed. It is then used for active shape control of a membrane structure model by adjusting its boundary tensions. Results indicate that under the developed control strategy, SMA wire actuators can offer very good accuracy in tracking displacement outputs and tension outputs. For the membrane structure shape control, the structure shape precision is improved greatly.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "85", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "93", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "10546680", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 27 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "85 - 93", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Fujun Peng", "Xin-Xiang Jiang", "Yan-Ru Hu", "Alfred Ng"], "keywords": ["actuators", "membranes", "shape control", "shape memory effects", "SMA wire actuators", "SMA wire temperature", "active shape control", "boundary tensions", "membrane structure shape control", "shape memory alloy", "strong nonlinear properties", "Active shape model", "Actuators", "Biomembranes", "Displacement control", "Hysteresis", "Shape control", "Shape memory alloys", "Temperature control", "Testing", "Wire", ""], "arnumber": "4805265"}
