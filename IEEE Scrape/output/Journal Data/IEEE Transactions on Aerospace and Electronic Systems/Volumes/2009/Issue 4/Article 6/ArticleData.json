Analytical methods are developed for evaluating the performance of complete partitioning (CP) and complete sharing (CS) with and without fixed channel reservation (FCR) for multi-class traffic in LEO-MSS. Furthermore, a novel threshold call admission (TCA) scheme which achieves better channel utilization and fair channel access is introduced and analyzed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1320", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1334", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "11071089", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "4", "pages": "1320 - 1334", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Zhipeng Wang", "P.
