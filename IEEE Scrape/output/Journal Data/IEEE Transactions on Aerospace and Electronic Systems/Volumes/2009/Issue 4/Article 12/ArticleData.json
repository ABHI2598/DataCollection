The use of measured Doppler information directly in the target trajectory estimation leads to a nonlinear filter implementation such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), particle filter etc. We investigate a method for including Doppler measurements as part of the data association process and then assess the benefits of this approach. It is well understood that data association performance can dominate the total performance of a tracker that is designed to track targets in the presence of clutter. In this case, the Doppler component of the measurements may be used in combination with the target position measurement as an additional discriminant of measurement origin. We have developed a simple but efficient Doppler data association (DDA) method which utilises both position and Doppler measurements for single and multi-target tracking. If the Doppler measurements are not used in trajectory state estimation, then the nonlinear filters for the incorporation of Doppler measurements are not required, however a significant improvement in tracking performance is still observed. The proposed DDA method is demonstrated using both the linear multi-target integrated probabilistic data association algorithm (LMIPDA) and the linear multi-target integrated track splitting algorithm (LMITS) in an active sonar underwater multi-target tracking scenario.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1400", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1417", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "11071088", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "4", "pages": "1400 - 1417", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Xuezhi Wang", "Darko Musicki", "Richard Ellem", "Fiona Fletcher"], "keywords": ["Kalman filters", "nonlinear filters", "particle filtering (numerical methods)", "probability", "radar tracking", "sensor fusion", "sonar tracking", "target tracking", "Doppler data association", "Doppler information", "Doppler measurements", "data association process", "enhanced multi-target tracking", "extended Kalman filter", "linear multi-target integrated probabilistic data association algorithm", "multi-target integrated track splitting algorithm", "nonlinear filter", "particle filter", "radar tracking systems", "sonar tracking systems", "target trajectory estimation", "time sequence", "Doppler measurements", "Doppler radar", "Nonlinear filters", "Position measurement", "Radar tracking", "Sonar measurements", "State estimation", "Target tracking", "Trajectory", "Underwater tracking", ""], "arnumber": "5310307"}
