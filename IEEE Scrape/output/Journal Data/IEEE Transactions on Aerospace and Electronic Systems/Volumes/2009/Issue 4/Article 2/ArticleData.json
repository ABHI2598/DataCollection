While the system promises to support Category I operations, significant technical challenges are encountered in supporting Category II and III operations. The primary concern has been the need to guarantee compliance with stringent requirements for navigation availability. This paper describes how a position domain method (PDM) may be used to improve system availability by reducing the inflation factor for standard deviations of pseudo-range correction errors. Used in combination with the current range domain method (RDM), a 30% reduction in the inflation factor is achieved with the same safety standard. LAAS prototype testing verifies the utility of the PDM to enhance Category II/III user availability.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1262", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1274", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "11071082", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "4", "pages": "1262 - 1274", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jiyun Lee", "Sam Pullen", "Per Enge"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "differential GPS navigation system", "inflation factor", "local area augmentation system", "position domain method", "pseudo-range correction errors", "range domain method", "sigma overbounding", "standard deviations", "Aircraft navigation", "Error correction", "FAA", "Global Positioning System", "Protection", "Prototypes", "Safety", "Satellite broadcasting", "Testing", "Uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "5310297"}
