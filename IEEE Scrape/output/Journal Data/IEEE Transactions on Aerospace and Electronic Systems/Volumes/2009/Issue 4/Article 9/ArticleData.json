An algorithm is proposed for estimating the source directions in addition to the estimation of unknown array parameters such as sensor gains and phases, as a way of performing array self-calibration. The cost function is an extension of the maximum likelihood (ML) criteria that were originally developed for DOA estimation with a perfectly calibrated array. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to explore the high-dimensional problem space and find the global minimum of the cost function. The design of the PSO is a combination of the problem-independent kernel and some newly introduced problem-specific features such as search space mapping, particle velocity control, and particle position clipping. This architecture plus properly selected parameters make the PSO highly flexible and reusable, while being sufficiently specific and effective in the current application. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique may produce more accurate estimates of the source bearings and unknown array parameters in a cheaper way as compared with other popular methods, with the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) approaching and asymptotically attaining the Cramer Rao bound (CRB) even in unfavorable conditions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1361", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1372", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "11071066", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "4", "pages": "1361 - 1372", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Minghui Li", "Yilong Lu"], "keywords": ["array signal processing", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "mean square error methods", "sensor arrays", "Cramer Rao bound", "DOA estimation", "PSO algorithm", "RMSE", "array self-calibration", "direction-of-arrival", "partially calibrated arrays", "particle position clipping", "particle swarm optimization", "particle velocity control", "problem-specific features", "root-mean-squared error", "search space mapping", "sensor array", "source bearing", "steering-vector estimation", "Cost function", "Direction of arrival estimation", "Kernel", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Particle swarm optimization", "Performance gain", "Phase estimation", "Phased arrays", "Sensor arrays", "Velocity control", ""], "arnumber": "5310304"}
