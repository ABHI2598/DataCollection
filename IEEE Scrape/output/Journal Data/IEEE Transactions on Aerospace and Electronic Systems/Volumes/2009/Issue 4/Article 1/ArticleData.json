We introduce a multiparametric generalization of a stepped-frequency train, and by exploiting a factorization of the autocorrelation function, will be able to effect a useful tradeoff between competing properties of the factors by careful choices of relevant parameters. We provide a detailed description of the method applied to a representative data set.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1251", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1261", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "11071086", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "4", "pages": "1251 - 1261", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Irina Gladkova"], "keywords": ["matrix decomposition", "radar theory", "autocorrelation function", "grating lobes", "multiparametric generalization", "stepped-frequency pulse train design", "stepped-frequency train", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Autocorrelation", "Bandwidth", "Cities and towns", "Doppler radar", "Frequency", "Gratings", "Radar scattering", "Signal design", "Uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "5310296"}
