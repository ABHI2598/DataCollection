Distributed detection macrodiversity (DDM) techniques are proposed where the quatizer thresholds of local detectors at base stations (radio access points) are optimized using a numerical global optimization algorithm called adaptive simulated annealing (ASA). The performance of such DDM schemes is studied for systems with and without channel coding, where the base stations employ multiple receive antennas over quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. It is shown that properly designed quantizers for the local detectors, with a few resolution bits can make the performance very close to optimal macrodiversity that requires a much larger bandwidth from the connection links to the fusion center.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1335", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1349", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "11071069", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "4", "pages": "1335 - 1349", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Frederic Martin", "Harry Leib"], "keywords": ["Rayleigh channels", "cellular radio", "diversity reception", "optimisation", "quantisation (signal)", "adaptive simulated annealing", "distributed detection macrodiversity", "fusion center", "macrodiversity enhanced cellular communication systems", "multiple receive antennas", "numerical global optimization algorithm", "quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels", "radio access points", "soft decision distributed detection schemes", "uplink cellular communication systems", "Bandwidth", "Base stations", "Communications technology", "Detectors", "Distributed decision making", "Fading", "Femtocell networks", "Military communication", "Receiving antennas", "Wireless communication", ""], "arnumber": "5310302"}
