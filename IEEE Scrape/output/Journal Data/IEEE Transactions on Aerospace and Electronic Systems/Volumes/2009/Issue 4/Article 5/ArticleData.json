After a brief introduction into the area of study, the article describes how a normal Shack-Hartmann wave front sensor is modified for use in detecting and tracking the focal spot. The paper details the analysis and development of the algorithms used in locating the focal spot on a thruster absorber utilizing a correlation method and an area centroid method. The article concludes with a paragraph on suitable future work.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1307", "volume": "45", "lastpage": "1319", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "11071097", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "4", "pages": "1307 - 1319", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Joseph N.
