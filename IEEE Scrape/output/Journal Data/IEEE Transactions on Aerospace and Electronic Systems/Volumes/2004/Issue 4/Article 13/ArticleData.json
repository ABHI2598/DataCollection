At present, the Japanese Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is under investigation through a cooperative effort between the government and the private sector. QZSS is considered a multi-function satellite system, as it is able to provide communication, broadcasting, and positioning services for mobile users in a specified region with a high elevation angle. The additional GPS compatible signals from QZSS can remarkably improve the availability, accuracy, and capability of GPS positioning. This work focuses on the performance of GPS augmentation using the proposed QZSS. The QZSS satellite constellation and signal structure are briefly reviewed. Positioning with pseudo-range and carrier phase are discussed. The performance of GPS augmentation using QZSS in the Asian-Pacific and Australian area is studied using software simulations. The results are presented using the number of visible satellites as a measure of availability, GDOP as a measure of accuracy, and ambiguity success rate as a measure of capability of carrier-phase-based positioning with spatial and temporal variations. The results show that the QZSS will improve not only the availability and accuracy of GPS positioning, but will also enhance the capability of the GPS carrier-phase-based positioning in Japan and neighboring regions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1249", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1260", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8258556", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1249 - 1260", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Falin Wu", "N.
