The main attribute of the novel inverter topology is the fact that it generates an ac output voltage larger or lower than the dc input one, depending on the instantaneous duty cycle. This property is not found in the classical voltage source inverter (VST), which produces an ac output instantaneous voltage always lower than the dc input voltage. The proposed inverter circuit topology provides the main switch for turn-on at zero-current-switching (ZCS) by an auxiliary resonant cell built before the output choke. A state-space averaging approach is employed to analyze the system. A design example of 500 W ac/dc inverter is examined to assess the inverter performance and it provides high power efficiency above 90.7% under the rated power.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1262", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1270", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8258557", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1262 - 1270", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Chien-Ming Wang", "Teng-Jen Chen"], "keywords": ["AC-DC power convertors", "resonant invertors", "state-space methods", "zero current switching", "500 W", "ac/dc inverter", "auxiliary resonant cell", "half-bridge series-resonant buck-boost inverter", "instantaneous duty cycle", "single-stage buck-boost inverter", "state-space averaging approach", "voltage source inverter", "zero-current-switching", "AC generators", "Circuit topology", "DC generators", "Inductors", "Inverters", "Resonance", "Switches", "Switching circuits", "Voltage", "Zero current switching", ""], "arnumber": "1386879"}
