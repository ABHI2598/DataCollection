The converter consists of an inverter and a diode-capacitor multiplier (DCM) and provides a voltage gain equal to double the number of multiplier steps. In the case of ac-dc conversion the proposed converter offers a practically unit power factor and provides a sine wave input current. The analysis of the steady state as well as the transient behavior of the DCM is given and simplified equivalent circuits are proposed. The prototype of the DCM has been built and tested to show the validity of the proposed converter. The theoretical analysis, the computer simulation results, and the experimental testing results are in good agreement.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1286", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1293", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8258559", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1286 - 1293", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
