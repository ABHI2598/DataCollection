A variety of proposals and regulations have already been established to increase the number of possible satellite positions. The optimum satellite arrangement carried out by considering the geographical distribution of service areas is an effective strategy for efficient utilization of the GSO. The genetic algorithm (GA) method is applied here to optimize the satellite arrangement. Initially, an example of the optimum arrangement of eight satellites is demonstrated by using the GA method to ensure accuracy of the newly developed program. Subsequently, a multiple beam satellite system concept is introduced to further improve the efficient utilization of the GSO. Finally, 80 satellites (40 service areas) in the ITU Region 1 example is solved using the GA method, resulting in a quasi-optimum satellite arrangement solution. By using the GA method, the quasi-optimum solution can be obtained by very short (e.g., several ten seconds) calculation times.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1217", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1227", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8258553", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1217 - 1227", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["T.
