First, the two-sensor registration problem is expressed by an averaged least-squares (LS) criterion function of the sensor measurements. The criterion function is optimized by a Newton algorithm. Then, the algorithm is extended to multiple-sensor case. The accuracy of the proposed estimation scheme achieves the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Theoretical analysis and simulations are employed to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1410", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1416", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8258571", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1410 - 1416", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Zi-Wei Zheng", "Yi-Sheng Zhu"], "keywords": ["least squares approximations", "measurement errors", "sensor fusion", "Cramer-Rao bound", "Newton algorithm", "data fusion", "least squares registration algorithm", "multiple sensor", "sensor measurements", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Analytical models", "Error correction", "Filtering", "Laboratories", "Least squares methods", "Neural networks", "Noise measurement", "Performance analysis", "Sensor systems", ""], "arnumber": "1386893"}
