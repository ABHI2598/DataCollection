This converter has the following features: natural power factor correction, soft switching, high-frequency (HF) transformer isolation with the series resonant tank operating in above resonance mode, etc. A new complementary gating control scheme is used for simultaneous control of boost converter and the SRC. Modes of operation are presented and analyzed. Based on the analysis, design curves are obtained. An optimum design is given and a design example is presented. Results obtained from SPICE simulation for the designed converter are given to verify the performance of the proposed converter for varying load as well as line voltage. Experimental results obtained from a laboratory prototype converter are presented to verify the theory.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1311", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1323", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8258561", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1311 - 1323", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["F.
