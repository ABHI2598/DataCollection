Measurement conversion is widely used such that the Kalman filter can be applied in the Cartesian coordinates. A number of improved measurement-conversion techniques have been proposed recently. However, they have fundamental limitations, resulting in performance degradation, as pointed out in a recent survey conducted by the authors. A filter is proposed here that is theoretically optimal in the sense of minimizing the mean-square error among all linear unbiased filters in the Cartesian coordinates. The proposed filter is free of the fundamental limitations of the measurement-conversion approach. Results of an approximate, recursive implementation are compared with those obtained by two state-of-the-art conversion techniques.
