Three different traffic classes are introduced, each with its particular optimisation criteria. Performance analysis of TCD routing, in terms of average packet delay and average data throughput of a particular traffic class, is evaluated for homogeneous and nonhomogeneous traffic scenarios using a specifically developed simulation model of the ISL network.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1160", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1172", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8258549", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1160 - 1172", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
