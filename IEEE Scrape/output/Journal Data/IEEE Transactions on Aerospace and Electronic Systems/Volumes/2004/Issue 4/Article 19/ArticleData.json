The one-way time transfer technique via a geostationary TV satellite standard time and frequency signal (STFS) dissemination system was considered. The differential method was also applied for mitigating errors in geostationary satellite STFS dissemination system. Analytical dynamic orbit determination with extended Kalman filter (EKF) was implemented to improve differential mode STFS (DSTFS) service accuracy by acquiring better accuracy of a geostationary satellite position. The perturbation force models applied for satellite dynamics include the geopotential perturbation up to fifth degree and order harmonics, luni-solar perturbations, and solar radiation pressure. All of the perturbation effects were analyzed by secular, short, and long period variations for equinoctial orbit elements such as semimajor axis, eccentricity vector, inclination vector, and mean right ascension of the geostationary satellite. The reference stations for orbit determination were composed of four calibrated stations. Simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of real time analytical orbit determination in Korea. The simulation results demonstrated that it is possible to determine real time position of geostationary satellite with the accuracy of 300 m rms. This performance implies that the time accuracy is better than 25 ns all over the Korean peninsula. The real time analytical orbit determination method developed in this research can provide a reliable, extremely high accurate time synchronization service through setting up domestic-only benchmarks.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1132", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1146", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8258547", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1132 - 1146", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jae-Cheol Yoon", "Kee-Hoon Lee", "Byoung-Sun Lee", "Bang-Yeop Kim", "Kyuhong Choi", "Young-Keun Chang", "Yong-Sik Chun", "Sung-Woong Ra"], "keywords": ["Kalman filters", "artificial satellites", "celestial mechanics", "satellite communication", "synchronisation", "time measurement", "Korea", "analytical dynamic models", "differential mode STFS service accuracy", "eccentricity vector", "equinoctial orbit elements", "extended Kalman filter", "frequency signal dissemination system", "geopotential perturbation", "geostationary TV satellite", "geostationary orbit determination", "geostationary satellite position", "inclination vector", "luni-solar perturbations", "mean right ascension", "national time synchronization", "one-way time transfer technique", "perturbation force models", "real time analytical orbit determination", "reference stations", "satellite dynamics", "semimajor axis", "solar radiation pressure", "standard time dissemination system", "Aerodynamics", "Aerospace electronics", "Aerospace engineering", "Analytical models", "Artificial satellites", "Frequency synchronization", "Modeling", "Radio broadcasting", "Reliability engineering", "Satellite broadcasting", ""], "arnumber": "1386869"}
