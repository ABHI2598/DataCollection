The lack of signal from the science targets precludes using the star as a feedback signal to control the science interferometer delay line. In order to solve this problem SIM uses pathlength feed forward (PFF) control of the science interferometer. In the case of controlling the science interferometer optical path, the information to position the science delay line comes from a combination of internal metrology, external metrology, and guide interferometer measurements. The accuracy of the internal and external metrology measurements and the guide interferometer measurements are important for the quality of the feed forward signal and also for the ultimate astrometric performance of the instrument. An instrument model of SIM has been built to evaluate optical performance and to emulate various observational scenarios. The effect of averaging methods to reduce metrology cyclic error and the viability of on-orbit calibration maneuvers are studied. The model consists of a real-time dynamics formulation of the spacecraft and a real-time attitude control system. Simulation results investigate the sensitivity of the feed forward signal to the various error sources and time-varying terms.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1228", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1238", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8258554", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "4", "pages": "1228 - 1238", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["I.
