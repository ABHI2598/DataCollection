The single-capacitor snubber is used to limit rising rate of drain-source voltage of the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) switch in the converters to reduce turn-off loss. In addition, the converters are operated at the boundary of continuous and discontinuous conduction modes (CCM), (DCM) to reduce turn-on loss, and in an interleaving fashion to reduce output current ripple. As compared with the counterparts of conventional converter topologies, the proposed converters have the merits of less component count, higher efficiency over a certain load range, smaller size, and they are easier to implement. Hardware measurements obtained from experimental prototypes have verified these merits.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "954", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "967", "date_publication": "July 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8147032", "date": "July 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 27 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "954 - 967", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yaow-Ming Chen", "Sheng-Yu Tseng", "Cheng-Tao Tsai", "Tsai-Fu Wu"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "current-mode circuits", "field effect transistor switches", "losses", "snubbers", "switching convertors", "MOSFET switch", "continuous conduction modes", "conventional converter topologies", "discontinuous conduction modes", "drain-source voltage", "hardware measurements", "interleaved buck converters", "single-capacitor snubber", "switch turn-off transition", "turn-off loss", "turn-on loss", "Buck converters", "FETs", "Hardware", "Interleaved codes", "MOSFET circuits", "Snubbers", "Switches", "Switching converters", "Topology", "Voltage", ""], "arnumber": "1337467"}
