The transmit waveform minimizes a scalar function penalizing weighted spectral energy in arbitrary frequency bands. Near constant power results from another penalty function for deviations from constant power, or constant power is enforced by a phase-only formulation. Next, a least squares solution for the receive waveform minimizes a weighted sum of suppressed band spectral energy and range sidelobes (for pulse and continuous wave operation), with a mainlobe response constraint. Both waveforms are calculated by iterative algorithms whose updates require only linear order in memory and computation, permitting quick calculation of long pulses with thousands of samples.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "851", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "861", "date_publication": "July 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8147024", "date": "July 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 27 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "851 - 861", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
