It provides ZCS operation for active switches and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) operation for passive switches. Besides operating at constant frequency and reducing commutation losses, the proposed ZCS-PWM switch cell has no additional current stress and conduction loss in the main switch. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed ZCS-PWM commutation cell, it was applied to a boost converter. Operating principle, theoretical analysis, design guidelines, and a design example are described and verified by experiment results obtained from a prototype rated 1 kW and operating at 40 kHz. The PWM switch model and state-space averaging approach is also used to estimate and examine the steady-state and dynamic character of ZCS-PWM boost converter system. Finally, the application of the proposed soft-switching technique in the dc-dc nonisolated converters is presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "879", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "888", "date_publication": "July 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8147026", "date": "July 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 27 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "879 - 888", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Chien-Ming Wang", "Juing-Huei Su", "Chia-Hao Yang"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "PWM power convertors", "insulated gate bipolar transistors", "state-space methods", "switching convertors", "1 KW", "40 KHz", "IGBT application", "PWM switch", "ZCS-PWM boost converter", "ZCS-PWM commutation cell", "ZCS-PWM switch cell", "active switches", "commutation losses reduction", "conduction loss", "constant frequency", "current stress", "dc-dc nonisolated converters", "design guidelines", "dynamic characteristics", "high-power applications", "insulated gate bipolar transistors", "operating principle", "passive switches", "power switches", "soft-switching technique", "state-space averaging approach", "steady-state characteristics", "theoretical analysis", "zero-current-switching pulsewidth-modulated", "zero-voltage-switching operation", "Frequency", "Guidelines", "Insulated gate bipolar transistors", "Prototypes", "Pulse width modulation", "Pulse width modulation converters", "Stress", "Switches", "Zero current switching", "Zero voltage switching", ""], "arnumber": "1337461"}
