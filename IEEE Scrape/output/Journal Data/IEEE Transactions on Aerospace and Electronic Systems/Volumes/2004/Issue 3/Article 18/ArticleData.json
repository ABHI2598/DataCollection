A monocular system must resolve the 3D ambiguity by assuming that objects rest on the ground. Thus the scene calibration gives a special status to a model of the ground (assumed planar here) and to the gravitationally vertical direction. A scene calibration procedure is described, developed for use in a fast-deployment video surveillance system. The procedure uses the video system itself as the only measuring instrument.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1105", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1110", "date_publication": "July 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8147044", "date": "July 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 27 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "1105 - 1110", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
