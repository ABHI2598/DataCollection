In the proposed approach a constrained Kalman filter based fault detection and isolation (FDI) method (Larson et al., 2002) is modified to reduce its computation load and then applied to detect and isolate a faulty actuator or sensor. Explicit algorithms are derived to estimate the effectiveness factor of a detected faulty actuator or sensor. Furthermore, a design concept of actuation reconfiguration is proposed and implemented in the derived control scheme to restrain the workload of a faulty actuator while recovering the prefault system performance. Simulation results on an aircraft dynamic model have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1110", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1117", "date_publication": "July 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8147045", "date": "July 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 27 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "1110 - 1117", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Guangjun Liu", "Dejun Wang", "Yuangchun Li"], "keywords": ["Kalman filters", "actuators", "aircraft", "control theory", "fault location", "fault tolerance", "sensors", "Kalman filter", "active control", "actuation reconfiguration", "aircraft dynamic model", "computation load reduction", "effectiveness factor estimation", "explicit algorithms", "fault detection", "fault isolation", "fault tolerant control", "faulty actuator", "faulty sensor", "prefault system performance", "workload restraining", "Actuators", "Aircraft", "Control systems", "Fault detection", "Fault tolerance", "Noise measurement", "Redundancy", "Sensor systems", "System performance", "Time measurement", ""], "arnumber": "1337485"}
