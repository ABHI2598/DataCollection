A space-time registration model is proposed to estimate the system biases and to perform time synchronization together for mobile radar and electronic support measure (ESM) systems. A space-time registration model for radar and ESM is first developed, and an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is proposed to estimate the space-time biases and target states simultaneously. The posterior Cramer-Rao bounds (PCRBs) are derived for the proposed UKF registration algorithm for ESM detection probability less than or equal to one. Theoretical analyses are performed to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. Computer simulations show that the UKF registration algorithm is indeed effective and robust for different radar and ESM tracking scenarios.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "824", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "836", "date_publication": "July 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8147022", "date": "July 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 27 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "824 - 836", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["W.
