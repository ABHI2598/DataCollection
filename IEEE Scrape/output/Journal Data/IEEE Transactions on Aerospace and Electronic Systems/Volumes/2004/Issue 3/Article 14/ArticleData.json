The magnetic field correction is based on the orbit geometry and its algorithm excludes the geomagnetic field model. The considered satellite is supposed to operate in the Earth-point mode and the Sun-point mode in accordance with the mission requirements. Particularly, the magnetic field correction is performed via static estimation based on an average method and dynamic estimation with an estimation law. Besides, the usefulness of the proposed method is investigated throughout both the simulation and the real telemetry data of KOMPSAT-1.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1020", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "1030", "date_publication": "July 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8147036", "date": "July 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 27 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "1020 - 1030", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Seon-Ho Lee", "Seung-Wu Rhee", "Hyo-Sung Ahn"], "keywords": ["artificial satellites", "magnetic fields", "magnetometers", "pointing systems", "Earth-point mode", "KOMPSAT-1", "Sun-point mode", "average method", "dynamic estimation", "estimation law", "geomagnetic field model", "induced magnetic disturbance", "magnetic field correction", "magnetometer", "orbit geometry", "satellite", "static estimation", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Filters", "Geometry", "Magnetic field measurement", "Magnetic sensors", "Magnetic separation", "Magnetometers", "Position measurement", "Satellites", "Sensor arrays", ""], "arnumber": "1337471"}
