However, all possible SFGs of a given dc-dc converter system will not yield the generalized graph. A systematic procedure and guidelines for developing unified flow graph models of the dc-dc boost converters, from which complete behavior can be determined is presented. Usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through examples. As an illustration a 2-cell cascade boost and interleaved boost converter systems are taken as examples. Derivation of large, small-signal and steady-state models from generalized flow graph is also demonstrated. Large-signal model is developed and programmed in TUTSIM simulator. Large-signal, responses against supply and load disturbances are obtained. Experimental observations are provided to validate the proposed algorithm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "259", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "271", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8004245", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "259 - 271", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
