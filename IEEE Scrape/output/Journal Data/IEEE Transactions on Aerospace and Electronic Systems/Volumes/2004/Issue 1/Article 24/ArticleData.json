Excellent approximations to the exact physical model have been developed which can rapidly predict the chaff fiber density and orientation as a function of location, time and fiber characteristics. Using this information, the time varying radar cross section (RCS) density is determined for any frequency and polarization anywhere within the chaff cloud. The results are consistent with full scale observations, and the computational speed allows the model to be integrated into existing real time radar simulations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "93", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "102", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7997669", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "93 - 102", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
