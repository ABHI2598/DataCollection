To this extent, many different and powerful algorithms have been produced to accomplish these tasks. However, unlike an optimal or adaptive method, an algebraic method for BSS and blind beamforming has the relative advantage of simplicity. This paper investigates such a technique that provides closed-form, algebraic expressions for BSS and beamforming in terms of performance and reliability. We provide these results, as well as a summary of the properties, and possible uses for this technique, in contrast to more optimal, adaptive techniques.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "221", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "235", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8004242", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "221 - 235", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
