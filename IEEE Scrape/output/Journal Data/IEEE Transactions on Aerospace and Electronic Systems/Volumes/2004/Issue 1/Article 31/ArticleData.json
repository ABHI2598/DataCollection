The data association problem is directly transformed into a 3D assignment, which is known to be NP hard. For generic passive sensors, it can be solved using conventional algorithms, while in PLAS, it becomes a formidable task due to the presence of bearing ambiguity. Thus, the central issue of the problem in PLAS is how to eliminate the bearing ambiguity without increasing tracking error. To solve this problem, the 3D assignment algorithm used the likelihood value of only those observed bearing measurements is modified by incorporating frequency information in consecutive time-aligned scans. The region of possible ghost targets is first established by the geometrical relation of PLAS with respect to target. The ghost targets are then confirmed and eliminated by generating multiple observations in consecutive scans. Representative simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "103", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "113", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7997670", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "103 - 113", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bonhwa Ku", "Jehan Yoon", "D.
