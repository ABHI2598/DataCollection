In order to solve the nonlinear filtering problem, one needs to solve the time-varying Schrodinger equation with an arbitrary initial condition. We then solve the time-varying Schrodinger equation by constructing the fundamental solution explicitly via a system of nonlinear ODES in case the potential is quadratic in state variables. This system of nonlinear ODES is solved explicitly by the power series method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "284", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "292", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8004247", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "284 - 292", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Shing-Tung Yau", "S.
