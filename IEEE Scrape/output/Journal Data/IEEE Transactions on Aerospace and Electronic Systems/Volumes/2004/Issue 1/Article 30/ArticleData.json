A three-phase two-leg switching mode rectifier with neutral-point-clamped topology is proposed to draw the sinusoidal line currents from the ac mains. The carrier-based current controller is used in the inner control loop to track the line current commands with unity power factor. The dc bus voltage controller is adopted in the outer control loop to regulate the dc-link voltage. A voltage compensator is used to balance the neutral point voltage on the dc tank. A three-phase two-leg inverter with neutral-point-clamped topology is adopted in the system to provide the clean ac output voltages to the critical or sensitive loads. The carrier-based current control scheme is adopted to improve the instantaneous output voltages. Experimental results show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "168", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "179", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7997675", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "168 - 179", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bor-Ren Lin", "Ta-Chang Wei", "Huann-Keng Chiang"], "keywords": ["invertors", "power conversion harmonics", "power factor correction", "rectifying circuits", "switched mode power supplies", "switching convertors", "AC line conditioner", "ac output voltages", "carrier-based current controller", "dc bus voltage controller", "dc tank", "dc-link voltage", "inner control loop", "line current commands", "linear loads", "neutral point voltage", "neutral-point-clamped topology", "nonlinear loads", "outer control loop", "power factor correction", "sinusoidal line currents", "three-phase two-leg inverter", "three-phase two-leg switching mode rectifier", "unity power factor", "voltage compensator", "Current control", "Low voltage", "Power factor correction", "Power harmonic filters", "Power system harmonics", "Pulse width modulation inverters", "Reactive power", "Switching converters", "Topology", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "1292151"}
