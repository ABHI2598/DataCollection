The filter has broad generality due to the minimal assumptions made in developing the theory. Track confirmation is decided on the basis of a probability measure that is fully computable from clutter properties measured from surveillance data, without needing to assume target properties such as trajectory or detectability. Experimental results on real surveillance datasets are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "336", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "345", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8004252", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "336 - 345", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
