Using the NPC topology, the voltage stress of power switches can be reduced to the half of the dc-link voltage. With the dc-link voltage controller and the phase locked loop circuit, the balanced and sinusoidal line currents can be drawn from the ac supply system under the balance and unbalance mains voltages. The hysteresis current comparators are adopted in the current control loop to track the line current commands. Three voltage levels are generated on the ac terminal to the neutral point. Simulations and experiments are provided to verify the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "180", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "189", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7997676", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "180 - 189", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bor-Ren Lin", "Yung-Chuan Lee", "Tsung-Yu Yang"], "keywords": ["current comparators", "harmonics suppression", "invertors", "phase locked loops", "power conversion harmonics", "power factor correction", "rectifying circuits", "switching convertors", "voltage control", "ac supply system", "ac terminal", "current harmonics", "dc-link voltage controller", "hysteresis current comparators", "input power factor", "line current commands", "neutral point", "neutral-point-clamped topology", "phase locked loop circuit", "power factor corrector", "power switches", "sinusoidal line currents", "three-phase high-power-factor rectifier", "voltage levels", "voltage stress", "Circuit topology", "Control systems", "Current control", "Hysteresis", "Phase locked loops", "Power system harmonics", "Reactive power", "Rectifiers", "Stress", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "1292152"}
