The ac input sides of three modules are \u0394-connected, and their dc output sides are connected in parallel. As any one module fault occurs, the remaining two modules becomes modified T-connected and continuously perform three-phase rectification with good line drawn power quality. When two constituted 1\u03c6 modules are faulted, the proposed 3\u03c6 SMR will be operated as 1\u03c6 SMR. The quantitative and robust voltage regulation controls for the developed SMR are made to consider the effects of changes of system parameters, operating condition, and number of connected modules.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "70", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "79", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7997667", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "70 - 79", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
