The interference can consist of both broadband and narrowband jammers, and is mitigated in two steps. The narrowband jammers are modelled as vector autoregressive (VAR) processes and rejected by temporal whitening. The spatial ing is implicitly achieved by estimating a sample covariance matrix and feeding its inverse into the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The EKF estimates of the code delay and the fading channel are used for a t-test for acquisition detection. Computer simulations demonstrate robust performance of the algorithm in severe jamming, and also show that the algorithm outperforms the conventional delay-locked loop (DLL).", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "132", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "144", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7997672", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "132 - 144", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Seung-Jun Kim", "R.
