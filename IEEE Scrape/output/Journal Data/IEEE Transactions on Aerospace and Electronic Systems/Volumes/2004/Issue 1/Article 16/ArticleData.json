A representative airborne early warning (AEW) system scenario, which is a challenging environment due to highly maneuvering targets, close target formations, large measurement errors, long sampling intervals, and low detection probabilities, provides the motivation for the new technique. Previously, a tracker using the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator combined with an assignment algorithm was shown to be more reliable than a conventional Kalman filter based approach in tracking similar targets but it still yielded track breakages due to the difficult environment. In order to combine the broken track segments and improve track continuity, a new track segment association algorithm using a discrete optimization approach is presented. Simulation results show that track segment association yields significant improvements in mean track life as well as in position, speed, and course rms errors. Also presented is a modified one-point initialization technique with range rate measurements, which are typically ignored by other initialization techniques, and a fine-step IMM estimator, which improves performance in the presence of long revisit intervals. Another aspect that is investigated is the benefit of \"deep\" (multiframe or N-dimensional, with N > 2) association, which is shown to yield significant benefit in reducing the number of false tracks.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "293", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "309", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8004248", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "293 - 309", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S. -W.
