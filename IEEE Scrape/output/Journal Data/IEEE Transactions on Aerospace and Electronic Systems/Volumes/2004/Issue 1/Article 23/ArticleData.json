Despite its well-known limitations, gain scheduling control appeared to be a focus of the research efforts. Scheduling of frozen-time, frozen-state controllers for fast time-varying dynamics is known to be mathematically fallacious, and practically hazardous. Therefore, recent research efforts are being directed towards applying time-varying controllers. In this paper we: 1) introduce a differential algebraic eigenvalue theory for linear time-varying systems; and 2) propose a PD-eigenstructure assignment scheme via a differential Sylvester equation and a command generator tracker (CGT) for linear time-varying systems. The PD-eigenstructure assignment is utilized as a regulator. A feedforward gain for tracking control is computed by using the command generator tracker. The whole design procedures of the proposed PD-eigenstructure assignment scheme are systematic in nature. The scheme could be used to determine the stability of linear time-varying systems easily as well as to provide a new horizon of designing controllers for the linear time-varying systems. A missile flight control application is presented to validate the proposed schemes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "145", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "157", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7997673", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "145 - 157", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ho Chul Lee", "Jae Weon Choi"], "keywords": ["aerospace control", "eigenstructure assignment", "feedforward", "linear systems", "missile control", "time-varying systems", "command generator tracker", "differential Sylvester equation", "differential algebraic eigenvalue theory", "feedforward gain", "gain scheduling control", "linear time-varying eigenstructure assignment", "missile flight control application", "time-varying dynamics", "tracking control", "Acceleration", "Aerospace control", "Aircraft", "Control systems", "Differential equations", "Dynamic scheduling", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "Missiles", "Stability", "Time varying systems", ""], "arnumber": "1292149"}
