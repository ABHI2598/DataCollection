A wideband space-time adaptive (STAP) filter architecture, based on subbanding, is developed and coupled with a one dimensional template-based minimum mean squared error (MMSE) classifier. The performance of this STAP/ATC (automatic target classification) algorithm is quantified using an extensive simulation. The level of residual clutter afforded by various filter configurations and the associated incremental improvement in ATC performance is quantified, revealing the potential for realizable hardware and software implementations to achieve acceptable ATC performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "190", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "205", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8004240", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "190 - 205", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
