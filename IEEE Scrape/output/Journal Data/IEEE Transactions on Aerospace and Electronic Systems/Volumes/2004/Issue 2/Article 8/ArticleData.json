An analysis of the error performance exhibited by the prototype LAAS, with and without the inclusion of the WBAPL in the system, is presented. The inclusion of the WBAPL is shown to not only increase the availability of the system, but also to improve its error performance. The improvement in performance is seen to be most pronounced when a reduced GPS SV set is available, a state that would otherwise result in the unavailability of LAAS. This is the first demonstration of simultaneous increase in availability and accuracy from the inclusion or a WBAPL into a prototype LAAS.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "734", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "741", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051418", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "734 - 741", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
