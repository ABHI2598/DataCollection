A simplified space vector pulsewidth modulation scheme (SVPWM) is adopted to track line current commands. Using a simplified SVPWM algorithm, the calculated time for the time duration of voltage vector is reduced. The adopted NPC converter has less power switches compared with the conventional three-level NPC converter. Only eight power switches and four clamping diodes with voltage stress of half the dc bus voltage are used in the circuit configuration. Based on the proposed control algorithm, a reference voltage vector is generated on the ac terminal for drawing the sinusoidal line currents with unity power factor. Computer simulation and experimental results based on a laboratory prototype are presented to verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "553", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "566", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051404", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "553 - 566", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bor-Ren Lin", "Ta-Chang Wei"], "keywords": ["PWM power convertors", "power factor correction", "power semiconductor switches", "switching convertors", "voltage control", "ac terminal", "adopted NPC converter", "dc bus voltage", "dc-link voltage regulation", "eight-switch NPC converter", "line current commands tracking", "neutral point clamped convertor", "power factor correction", "power switch", "reference voltage vector", "simplified SVPWM algorithm", "sinusoidal line currents", "space vector modulation strategy", "space vector pulsewidth modulation", "three-phase NPC converter", "unity power factor", "voltage stress", "AC generators", "Circuits", "Clamps", "Diodes", "Power factor correction", "Pulse modulation", "Space vector pulse width modulation", "Stress", "Switching converters", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "1310004"}
