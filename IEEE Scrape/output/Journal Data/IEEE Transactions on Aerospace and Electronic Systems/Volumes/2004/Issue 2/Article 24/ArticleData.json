The two well-known approaches, namely the maximum likelihood estimator with probabilistic data association (ML-PDA) and the multiple hypotheses tracking (MHT) via multiframe assignment, are characterized as special cases of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and their performance limits indicated. A new detection scheme based on the optimal gating is proposed and the associated parameter estimation scheme modified within the ML-PDA framework. A simplified example shows the effectiveness of the new algorithm in detection performance under heavy clutter. Extension of the results to state estimation with measurement origin uncertainty is also discussed with emphasis on joint detection and recursive state estimation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "675", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "694", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051413", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "675 - 694", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Huimin Chen", "X.
