By defining at least two corresponding points from the radar image and the electronic charts, the technique provides a rapid and accurate calibration in range and bearing, giving also estimates for the speed, heading, latitude, and longitude of the ship. The method is tested with simulated data to check convergence and later with real data obtained from a navigation console installed on a patrol boat The technique does not require GPS nor speed information from the ship log unit, however it is shown that their inclusion can improve the estimation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "725", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "734", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051417", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "725 - 734", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
