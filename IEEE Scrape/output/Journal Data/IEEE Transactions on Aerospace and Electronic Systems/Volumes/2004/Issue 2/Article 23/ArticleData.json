A technique is introduced here to mitigate error due to ground-reflected MP signals. The technique uses two orthogonal dipoles to capture the direct GPS signal and the ground-reflected GPS signal. Adjusting the amplitude and phase of the received voltage between the two dipoles can reduce the impact of MP error. Theoretical derivations of this technique are performed for a GPS signal upon reflection from dry soil, seawater, and fresh water. The theoretical results are verified with a real world experiment on the aforementioned surfaces. GPS pseudo-range (PR) and carrier-to-noise ratio (C/No) measurements for specific satellites are used to verify the predicted theoretical results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "536", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "552", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051403", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "536 - 552", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
