The search algorithm is based on the k-shortest path algorithm that maximizes the effectiveness of the search in term of searching through the maximum uncertainty region, given a constraint on the endurance time of the UAV and on the location of the base station from which the UAVs operate. These constraints set apart this class of problems from the usual search and surveillance problems. We compare the performance of this algorithm with a random search and a greedy strategy search, We also implement the algorithm for the case of multiple UAVs searching an unknown region. The cases of delayed and partial information are also considered. Simulation results that demonstrate the efficacy of the technique are also presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "491", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "509", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051400", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "491 - 509", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
