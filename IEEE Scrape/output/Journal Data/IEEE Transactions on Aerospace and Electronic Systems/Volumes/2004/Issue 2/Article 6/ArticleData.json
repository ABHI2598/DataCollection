The GPS is used as reference during the time it is available. The data from GPS and inertial navigation system (INS) are used to build a structured knowledge base consisting of behavior of the INS in some special scenarios of vehicle motion. With the same data, the proposed fuzzy system is trained to obtain the corrected navigation data. In the absence of the GPS information, the system will perform its task only with the data from INS and with the fuzzy correction algorithm. This paper shows, using Matlab simulations, that as long as the GPS unavailability time is no longer than the previous training time and for the scenarios a priori defined, the accuracy of trained ANFIS, in absence of data from a reference navigation system, is better than the accuracy of stand-alone INS. The flexibility of model is also analyzed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "591", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "600", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051407", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "591 - 600", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
