Optimal filter gains are derived for minimizing the total covariance of the estimation error due to measurement noise and parameter uncertainty. It is shown that these filter gains for a two-state system with a Gaussian parameter satisfy the Kalata relation in steady state. Equations are also derived for optimally filtering measurements in arbitrary time order. This reduced state estimator offers novelties over a traditional Kalman filter in its application to the class of problems considered. The total error covariance, which is minimized, makes no use of plant noise. Furthermore, the filter is easier to optimize in high dimensional and multiple sensor applications as well as in processing out-of-sequence measurements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "446", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "461", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051397", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "446 - 461", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
