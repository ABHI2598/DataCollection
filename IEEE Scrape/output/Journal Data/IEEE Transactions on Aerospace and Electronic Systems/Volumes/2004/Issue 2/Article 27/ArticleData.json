For applications involving stationary targets, long integration times and process averaging are easily tolerated. In situations where the target or radar platform moves at high speed, the impact of this relative motion on system design should be considered. This work addresses the statistical performance of a generic random-noise radar receiver and examines the inter-relationships between design parameters and performance tradeoffs. Complementing this examination, a random-noise monopulse system is also investigated as a possible architecture for real-time angle estimation. Simulations and numerical illustrations provide the basis of processor design and performance prediction.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "434", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "445", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051396", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "434 - 445", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yan Zhang", "R.
