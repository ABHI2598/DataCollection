In these experiments, a rendezvous laser radar (RVR) was used as the primary navigation sensor during the final approach phase (relative distances from 500 m to 2 m). The RVR functioned properly, and its characteristics, which are measurement accuracy, optical propagation, and acquisition/tracking, satisfied the requirements. The experimental results show that RVR is effective for autonomous rendezvous docking.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "617", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "626", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051409", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "617 - 626", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
