This result leverages the application of lifetime, in-situ control of MEMS in order to provide quality assurance of microsystems in safety critical applications. A position feedback signal produced by a through-wafer optical microprobe has been used for comb resonator system model identification by two independent methods to accurately determine the effective mass, damping, and spring constant values of the device. After accurate determination of system parameters, closed-loop impulse disturbance damping and proportional-integral-differential (PID) translational control were applied. Closed-loop control results presented indicate controllability of such microstructures and response times on the order of the natural frequency of the device.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "567", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "575", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051405", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "567 - 575", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["L.
