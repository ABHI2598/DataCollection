This is especially true when the system is operating in a hostile environment, such as space. This paper discusses a change made to the Space Shuttle main engines (SSMES) that affected the solid rocket booster (SRB) performance, and illustrates how databases maintained by the different subsystem contractors can be integrated, correlated, and evaluated to improve a subsystem component performance model. The enhanced model can be used not only for better prediction of component performance on the existing system, but can be used on upgrades to the system, or the next generation space shuttle solid rocket. motor.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "478", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "490", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051399", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "478 - 490", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
