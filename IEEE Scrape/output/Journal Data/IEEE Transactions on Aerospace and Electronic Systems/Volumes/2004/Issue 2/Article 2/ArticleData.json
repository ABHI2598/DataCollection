It is shown that the sensor bias estimates can be obtained dynamically using the outputs of the local (biased) state estimators. This is accomplished by manipulating the local state estimates such that they yield pseudomeasurements of the sensor biases with additive noises that are zero-mean, white, and with easily calculated covariances. These results allow evaluation of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the covariance of the sensor bias estimates, i.e., a quantification of the available information about the sensor biases in any scenario. Monte Carlo simulations show that this method has significant improvement in performance with reduced rms errors of 70% compared with commonly used decoupled Kalman filter. Furthermore, the new method is shown to be statistically efficient, i.e., it meets the CRLB. The extension of the new technique for dynamically varying sensor biases is also presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "576", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "590", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051406", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "576 - 590", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Xiangdong Lin", "Y.
