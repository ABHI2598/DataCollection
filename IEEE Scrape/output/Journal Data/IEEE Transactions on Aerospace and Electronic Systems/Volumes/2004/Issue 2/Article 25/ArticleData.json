Swerling II and IV expressions are easily generalized by simply redefining the p term in the cumulative binomial probability to represent the probability of detection associated with the noncoherent detector output. The Swerling I and III cases are somewhat more complicated. For these latter cases we have developed a numerical technique that we have named \"piecewise linear integration\". With this technique we have the means to evaluate the relevant detection probabilities, and we can compare two alternative ways of Implementing RF diversity for the cascaded detector above.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "751", "volume": "40", "lastpage": "755", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "8051420", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "751 - 755", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
