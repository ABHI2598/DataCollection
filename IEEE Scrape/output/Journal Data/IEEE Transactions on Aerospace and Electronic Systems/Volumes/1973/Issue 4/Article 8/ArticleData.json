The algorithms are obtained on the basis of the state augmentation approach, used earlier by the authors, for dealing with linear smoothing problems. Both discrete-and continuous-time forms of solutions are presented and the results are illustrated by considering a radar tracking problem. Some of the advantages of the proposed smoothing solutions compared to existing ones are also discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "529", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "534", "date_publication": "July 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "529 - 534", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["K.
