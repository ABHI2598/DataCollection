A global system with a capacity of 10 duplex voice/data channels (plus an interrogation/reply channel) per satellite is described. The capability is achieved with a 0-dB gain UHF antenna in the ship and a UHF phased array in the satellite, which produces 11 steerable beams, each with 30-dB peak gain. The links between satellite and shore are assumed to be at SHF. A dedicated satellite weighs 320 kg, which can be launched with an up-rated Thor-Delta. The prime power requirement of 730 watts is provided by an oriented solar array.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "504", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "511", "date_publication": "July 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "504 - 511", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
