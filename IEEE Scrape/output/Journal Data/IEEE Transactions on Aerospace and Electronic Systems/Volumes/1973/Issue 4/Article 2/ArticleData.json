When there is a peak power limitation, weighting the amplitudes produces a loss in signal-to-noise ratio. A general expression is derived for the loss factor under the peak power limitation, and loss factor formulas are given for the following cases: Case A: Full nominal weights upon reception. Uniform weights on transmission. Case B: Square roots of the nominal weights on both transmission and reception. Case C: Full nominal weights on both transmission and reception. These cases are listed in order of increasing loss. Numerical results are tabulated for regular spacings and for the following nominal weights: 1) Dolph-Tchebycheff, 2) Taylor, 3) Hamming, and 4) Hann.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "486", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "494", "date_publication": "July 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "486 - 494", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Harry Urkowitz", "J.
