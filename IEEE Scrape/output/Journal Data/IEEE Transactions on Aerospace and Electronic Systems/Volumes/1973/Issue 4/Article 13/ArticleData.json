When diffraction is negligible and the surface has unit quantum efficiency, this detector is equipollent with the optimum detector of the image-forming light. Its performance is compared with that of the threshold detector and that of a detector basing its decisions on the total number of photoelectrons from a finite area of the image. The illuminance of the image is postulated to have a Gaussian spatial distribution. All three detectors exhibit nearly the same reliability.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "561", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "570", "date_publication": "July 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "561 - 570", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Carl W.
