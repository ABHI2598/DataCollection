The techniques of singular-point analysis are combined with piecewise linear techniques to permit determination of solution trajectories on the phase plane. Clear insight is provided, not only into steady-state oscillation, but also into transient behavior of the circuit. Experimental results confirming the analytical model are included.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "571", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "584", "date_publication": "July 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "571 - 584", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Fred C. y.
