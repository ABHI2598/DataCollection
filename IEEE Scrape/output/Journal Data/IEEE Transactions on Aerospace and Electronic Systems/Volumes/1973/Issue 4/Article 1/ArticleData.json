Up to now, digital computers have not been used for the control of short periodic angular oscillations. This task can be solved with the capability of digital computers now available. A good vehicle for the realization of appropriate control equations is the \u00c2\u00bffrequency transformation\u00c2\u00bf. Using the simplified dynamics of a supersonic aircraft as an example, a procedure for synthesis of a digital control filter is presented. After a first evaluation in the s domain, the design is checked for validity in the frequency domain. If necessary, the original design is corrected appropriately.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "478", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "485", "date_publication": "July 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "478 - 485", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
