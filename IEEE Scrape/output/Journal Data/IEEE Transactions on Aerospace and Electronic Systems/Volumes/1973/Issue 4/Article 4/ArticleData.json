The system is shown to be applicable to a communication system in which the arrival times of signals are unknown. The decision statistics are chisquare distributed (either central or noncentral), and recursive methods of computing probabilities of error are derived. A simple digital processor for implementing the system is also described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "499", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "503", "date_publication": "July 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "499 - 503", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["George M.
