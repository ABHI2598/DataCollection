The nonlinearity may be desirable or undesirable; that is, the sidelobe level of the range response may be decreased or increased depending on the shape and amount of nonlinearity. The results of this paper may be used to predict the actual range laws of existing \u00c2\u00bflinear\u00c2\u00bf FM radars; or, alternately, to specify the desired amount of modulation nonlinearity for new FM radars so that superior sidelobe suppression can be realized.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "598", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "606", "date_publication": "July 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "598 - 606", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Leon W.
