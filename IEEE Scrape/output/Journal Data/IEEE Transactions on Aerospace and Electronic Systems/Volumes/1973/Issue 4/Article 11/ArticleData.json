Similar plots are then used to compare two practical receivers designed to combat the interference. Degradation plots are shown to allow easy identification of each receiver's range of usefulness, as well as identification of variance bounds demanded of channel parameter estimates which the receivers require.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "548", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "555", "date_publication": "July 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "July 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "548 - 555", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
