This discrepancy is taxing if the storage required for the azimuth processing is provided by cores, magnetic drums, and the like. Thus, as a practical matter, one considers presumming of the data prior to correlation in an attempt to achieve the desired performance with a minimum amount of digital storage. In this paper, the optimum (in terms of resolution) presummer is derived, along with the optimum apportionment of the available storage capacity between the presumming and correlation operations. Under the condition (or generally pessimistic approximation) that the illumination pattern of the antenna uniformly illuminates a Doppler bandwidth equal to the PRF of the radar, the optimum presumming coefficients are the first Np Fourier coefficients of a function which is one of the Doppler bandwidth to be correlated and zero on the remainder of the PRF bandwidth, where Np is the number of transmitted radar pulses over which presumming is provided. Increasing Np reduces the degradation due to presumming, but may leave inadequate storage for correlation. Hence, we optimize the apportionment between the two operations and present the obtainable resolution as a function of total storage and the number of transmitted pulses in the received Doppler history.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "166", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "176", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "166 - 176", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["William M.
