As is well known, a filter which provides heavy smoothing can not accurately track an evasive maneuver, and conversely. Consequently, one is led to the consideration of adaptive methods of filter design. This paper presents an improved self-adaptive filter algorithm for on-line solution of the above problem. Basically, this algorithm utilizes the orthogonality property of the residual time series to force the filter to automatically track the optimal gain levels in a changing environment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "197", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "207", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "197 - 207", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
