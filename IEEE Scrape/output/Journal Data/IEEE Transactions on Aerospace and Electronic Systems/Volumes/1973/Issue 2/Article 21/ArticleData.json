The described method can also be used for probability of detection calculations when the radar target cross section follows a specified probability density function. Using the computational procedure of the paper, a number of curves are generated which can be used for probability of detection calculations with exponential and Gaussian radar target cross-section distributions. The results obtained using theoretical distributions are compared with the corresponding results using actual target cross-section measurements. The results of computer runs are compared to the corresponding values in the literature where available.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "300", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "305", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "300 - 305", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
