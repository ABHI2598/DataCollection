The purpose of the monitoring equipment is to minimize the mean time to repair faults and to exercise the overall system for pre-mission alignment and calibration. In addition, it is used to periodically check for performance degradation in key areas of the system. The paper describes the design approach used to meet the above requirements. Three types of signals are monitored: analog, digital, and switch closure. A list of each type is given and the technique used to monitor each is described. The design approach for pre-mission alignment and calibration is outlined. Tests performed are: RF alignment of the boresight axis, range tracking accuracy, angle servo calibration and accuracy, and receiver figure of merit measurements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "219", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "224", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "219 - 224", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Herbert Brockman"], "keywords": ["Calibration", "Computerized monitoring", "Degradation", "Fault detection", "Performance evaluation", "Radar detection", "Radar equipment", "Radar tracking", "Switches", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "4103112"}
