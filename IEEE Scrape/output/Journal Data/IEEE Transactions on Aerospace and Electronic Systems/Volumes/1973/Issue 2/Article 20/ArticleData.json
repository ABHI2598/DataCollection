The demands thrust upon electric utilities by pressure groups and legislation provide unsatisfactory guidance for environmental considerations. Environmental considerations are necessary for transmision lines, but realistic, flexible rules must be developed to balance protection of the ecology and the need for electrical energy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "296", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "299", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "296 - 299", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Harry E.
