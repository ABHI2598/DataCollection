Optimal solutions that include state and control variable constraints are obtained for both problems. Two algorithms are given for computation of the minimum and maximum altitude loss associated with the pilot-controlled go-around maneuver. A matrix operator is obtained that can be used for in-flight computation of the altitude loss on a small general-purpose digital computer. The flare optimization presented is for a cost functional that includes both the longitudinal touchdown dispersion and the normal acceleration. A closed-loop mechanization is given that approximates the optimal trajectory. A second matrix operator which can be used for prediction of the longitudinal touchdown point is obtained. Uncertainties are also obtained for the purpose of establishing a prediction confidence level. It is proposed that these prediction techniques should be incorporated into a decision making performance monitor. This monitor could provide the pilot with a continuous assessment of the approach and could generate a preflare decision on whether or not to commit the aircraft to the flare maneuver.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "280", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "289", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "280 - 289", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Glenn Buell", "C.
