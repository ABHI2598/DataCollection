The signal fluctuations are modeled by a Gaussian process and the noise performance of both linear and nonlinear first-order tracking systems is considered. In the nonlinear case, the Ito versus Stratonovich calculus difficulty arises, but it is resolved to make sense physically. Several analytical results are obtained which are useful in analyses of tracking systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "187", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "196", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "187 - 196", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["John E.
