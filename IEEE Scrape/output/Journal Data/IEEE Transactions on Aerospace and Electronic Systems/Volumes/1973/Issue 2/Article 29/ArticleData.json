For radar applications, the mean value of the variate is useful, and this correspondence derives the effect upon the mean value of various degrees of limiting. Numerical results are presented in the form of a family of curves where the limit level is the abscissa and the resulting mean value is the ordinate.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "332", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "335", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "332 - 335", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Harry Urkowitz"], "keywords": ["Clutter", "Electromagnetic scattering", "Frequency", "Optical scattering", "Optical surface waves", "Particle scattering", "Radar scattering", "Rough surfaces", "Shape", "Surface roughness", ""], "arnumber": "4103130"}
