It is emphasized that we cannot continue to expand the use and power of the electromagnetic spectrum without adequate consideration of its possible biological effects. New research efforts must be started in this area, utilizing a strong and well-coordinated interdisciplinary approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "225", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "228", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "225 - 228", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Paul E.
