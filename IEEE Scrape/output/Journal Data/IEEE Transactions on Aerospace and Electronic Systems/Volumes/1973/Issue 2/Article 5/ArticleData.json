The sensors are based on the use of magnetically activated reed switches suitably compensated by resistors. In order to provide physical and electrical protection, the switches and resistors are encapsulated in a fuel and oil resistant electrical insulation formed of alternate layers of polyimide film and compatible fluorocarbon polymers.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "177", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "182", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "177 - 182", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["J.
