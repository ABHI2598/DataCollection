The dependence can be reduced by a general envelope normalization. This can be done without degrading the performance of the adaptive array. Special cases of the normalization are envelope limiting, considered in [4], and one-bit digitization of the real and imaginary parts of the signal from which the envelopes are formed, considered in [5]. Another important special case is one-bit digitization of the imaginary part of the signal from which the envelopes are formed while the real part is set to zero.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "328", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "329", "date_publication": "March 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "March 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "328 - 329", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
