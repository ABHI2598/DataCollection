The optimum values of the filter coefficients are found and are approximated by a simple expression. The optimum two-pole filter requires a 0.15-dB increase in signal-to-noise ratio in order to provide the same detection capability as the optimum detector, and yields azimuth estimates whose standard deviation are within 15 percent of the Cram\u00c3\u00a9r-Rao lower bound. The estimator is simple to implement, avoiding the storage requirements of the moving window detector and the bias complications of the feedback integrator.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "649", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "653", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "649 - 653", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["B.
