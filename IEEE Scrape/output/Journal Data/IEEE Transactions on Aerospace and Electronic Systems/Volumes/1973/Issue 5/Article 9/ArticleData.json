A practical constraint is introduced: the amplitude of each subpulse in the transmit waveform is taken to be fixed. The need for such a constraint is dictated in most radar applications, because the transmitter is most efficiently utilized by saturating its amplifying tube. An algorithm for generating optimal waveforms subject to this new constraint is presented, and the performance of the resulting waveforms is compared with those obtained using existing optimization techniques.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "679", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "687", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "679 - 687", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
