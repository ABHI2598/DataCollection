In addition, if the required SNR is known for any number of integrated pulses, the required SNR for any other number is easily determined. A closed-form expression is given for radar collapsing loss, expressed in terms of the equivalent integrated signal-to-noise ratio required to produce a given combination of false-alarm and detection probabilities. Alternatively, the single-sample signal-to-noise ratio of a set of samples may be used together with the closed-form expression for integration gain to get the equivalent integrated signal-to-noise ratio.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "781", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "783", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "781 - 783", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Harry Urkowitz"], "keywords": ["Closed-form solution", "Clutter", "Filters", "Frequency", "Performance gain", "Radar detection", "Rain", "Signal to noise ratio", "System performance", ""], "arnumber": "4103211"}
