The specific case at hand is the angular resolution of several broadcasting targets by a passive, standard, four-horn amplitude monopulse system. It is shown that when all broadcasting targets emit spectrally equivalent wide-sense stationary signals and the antenna and target geometry are fixed, the signals presented to the radar signal processor are equivalent to those of a canonical complex of threee broadcasting targets, one at an arbitrary angle \u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf, one at a null of the sum channel pattern, and one at a null of the difference channel pattern. In the case of broadband flat spectral transmission, two of the three targets in the canonical complex cannot be distinguished from receiver noise. A simple method for determining the angle (or angles) at which a monopulse antenna will attempt to track a broadcasting target complex is presented. Generalizations of this theory to active and/or more complicated monopulse systems are possible.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "643", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "648", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "643 - 648", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
