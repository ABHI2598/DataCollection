When tracking with noise, the technique provides angle error performance which compares quite favorably with the expected performance given in [1] Furthermore, the large bias errors usually encountered in normal monopulse systems at low elevation angles are removed. Results of typical tracks are given, both for the method of [1], and for a modified version of the method which applies primarily to shipboard radar systems. Some results on loss of lock are also presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "654", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "659", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "654 - 659", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Peyton Z.
