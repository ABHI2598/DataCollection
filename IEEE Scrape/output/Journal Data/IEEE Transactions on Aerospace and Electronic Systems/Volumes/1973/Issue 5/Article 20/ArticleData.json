This correspondence describes the procedure of selecting a set of PRF's in such a manner that the unambiguous Doppler achievable with the entire set is maximized. Based on this optimization of the set of PRF's, we determine how many PRF's the set should contain in order to minimize the required beam dwell time for a specified unambiguous Doppler.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "778", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "781", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "778 - 781", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
