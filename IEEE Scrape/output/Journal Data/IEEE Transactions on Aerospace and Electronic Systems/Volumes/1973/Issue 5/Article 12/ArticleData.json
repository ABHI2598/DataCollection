The maximization of the receiver output signal-to-interference ratio is used as a performance criterion with unit energy constraint on both signal and filter. In the filter design problem, the optimum filter function is the solution of a linear integral equation. The kernel of the integral equation is a function of the target and medium scattering functions and the reverberation distribution. In the signal design problem, a similar type of integral equation is obtained as in the filter optimization problem. In the joint signal and filter design problem, it is shown that the optimum signal and filter functions are the solutions to a pair of linear integral equations with the largest (SIR)O. Several examples are investigated for different mediums and reverberation distributions with the finite matrix approximation method. An interative technique is used to compute the joint optimization of signal and filter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "701", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "713", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "701 - 713", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
