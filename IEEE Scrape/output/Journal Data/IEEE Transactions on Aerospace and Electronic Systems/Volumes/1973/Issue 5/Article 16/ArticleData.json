In this paper the steady-state rms errors that are excited in a damped inertial navigation system are analytically determined for four gravity uncertainty models and two vehicle maneuver models. The statistical approach used in this paper is compared with an alternate scheme (\u00c2\u00bfdirect simulation\u00c2\u00bf) that does not require statistical models for gravity uncertainties.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "741", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "752", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "741 - 752", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Stanley K.
