This paper describes and analyzes, by computer- assisted mathematical techniques, a nutation damper for a dual-spin spacecraft which does not require an active \u00c2\u00bfelement\u00c2\u00bf. Damping is achieved through the inherent cross-axis torques generated by the spacecraft products of inertia and the existing motor controlling the relative spin rates of the two dynamic components comprising the spacecraft.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "688", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "693", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "688 - 693", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Kevin Phillips"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Control systems", "Damping", "Error correction", "Motion analysis", "Motion control", "Space vehicles", "Torque control", "Transfer functions", "Wheels", ""], "arnumber": "4103200"}
