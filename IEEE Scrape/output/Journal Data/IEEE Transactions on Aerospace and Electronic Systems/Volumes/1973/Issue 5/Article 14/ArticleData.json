The noise and the dynamic range of the radiation detectors used, the atmospheric inhomogeneities, and the atmospheric propagation losses of the electromagnetic radiation are considered. In addition, the best measuring path length as a function of a molecule density and atmospheric transparency and irregularity is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "725", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "731", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "725 - 731", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Lars-goran Rosengren"], "keywords": ["Air pollution", "Atmospheric measurements", "Electromagnetic interference", "Electromagnetic measurements", "Electromagnetic wave absorption", "Gas lasers", "Laser noise", "Pollution measurement", "Resonance", "Sensitivity analysis", ""], "arnumber": "4103204"}
