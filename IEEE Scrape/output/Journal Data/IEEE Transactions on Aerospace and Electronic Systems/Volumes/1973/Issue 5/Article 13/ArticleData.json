The latter are expressed in terms of the former so as to maximize clutter attenuation. Interpulse periods are optimized so as to remove blind velocities. The many local optima of the interpulse periods have improvement factors that show differences of up to 6 dB for a 5-pulse canceler. A computer program has been developed that combines random search and the gradient method to produce points that combine a high value of the improvement factor with good blind speeds performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "714", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "724", "date_publication": "Sept. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Sept. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "714 - 724", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Peter J.
