In a conventional local-level mechanization, this is generally accomplished by correcting the vertical channel integrators with the difference between the inertial system and altimeter indication of vertical position. However, in a space-stable system the procedure is not as clear since a vertical channel is not physically present. Three altitude damping mechanizations for a space-stable inertial navigation system are proposed. The equivalent local-level mechanizations are then found by comparing error propagation equations in a common coordinate frame.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "Jan. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "18 - 27", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Raymond A.
