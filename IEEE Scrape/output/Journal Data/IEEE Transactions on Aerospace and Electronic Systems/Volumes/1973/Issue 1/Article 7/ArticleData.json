This loss results because the variation in atmospheric refraction versus altitude makes the atmosphere act like a lens, causing thinning of radar signal energy to and from the target, independent of frequency. The magnitude of loss is derived and is plotted versus grazing angle and range. The maximum two-way loss, occurring at zero degrees grazing angle and a range well beyond the atmosphere, is 2.9 dB.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "51", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "54", "date_publication": "Jan. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "51 - 54", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Thomas A.
