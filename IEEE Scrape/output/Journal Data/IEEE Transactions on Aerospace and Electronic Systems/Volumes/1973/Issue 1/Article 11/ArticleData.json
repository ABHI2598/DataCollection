The data are linearly related to the state variable to be determined. By employing the Gauss-Markov theorem, the optimal recursive estimate (including the nonstationary property of the system), which is a matrix operation on the transformed data, is obtained. The efficiency of the estimator is measured by the amount of data required and the speed of convergence. Both of these have proved to be of satisfactory and acceptable quality.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "76", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "83", "date_publication": "Jan. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "76 - 83", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Louis R.
