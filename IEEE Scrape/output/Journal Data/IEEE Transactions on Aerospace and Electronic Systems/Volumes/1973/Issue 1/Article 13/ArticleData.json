The receiver is assumed to process the received waveform with a clutter-tracking oscillator and a window function is employed to obtain short-term spectra. Except for the broadening effects of the window function, it is shown that the clutter spectrum can be simply related to the antenna voltage-gain pattern. It is further shown, in the scanning antenna case, that the combined spectral broadening due to platform motion and antenna scanning cannot be assumed to be the result of the convolution of the separate effects unless the antenna gain pattern has a Gaussian shape. The approximate clutter expressions are illustrated by examples and are shown to agree well with the results of computer calculations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "93", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "103", "date_publication": "Jan. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "93 - 103", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
