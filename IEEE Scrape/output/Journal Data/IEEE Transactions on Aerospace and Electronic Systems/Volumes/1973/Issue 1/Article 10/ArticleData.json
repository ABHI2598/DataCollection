The particular case studied is a satellite air traffic control system which utilizes range measurements to two geostationary satellites and an altitude measurement. Three approximate filters are examined as suboptimal realizations of the minimum-variance filter and simulation results are presented to show that simple first-order approximation is an adequate representation. The parametric relationship between state covariance, measurement noise, vehicle maneuver structure, data rate, and system geometry is presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "65", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "75", "date_publication": "Jan. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "65 - 75", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Stephen G.
