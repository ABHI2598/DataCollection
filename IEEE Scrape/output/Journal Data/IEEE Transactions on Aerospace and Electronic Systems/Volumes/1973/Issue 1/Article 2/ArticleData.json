New instruments have been appearing steadily and will no doubt continue to do so in the near future. While this new generation of instrumentation is being field tested, refined, and applied to air quality measurement problems, development of more sensitive and versatile techniques continues. This paper gives an overview of the new generation of air quality monitoring instruments, comparing them with some more traditional methods.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Jan. 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "Jan. 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "11 - 17", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Max Loewenstein"], "keywords": ["Air pollution", "Atmospheric measurements", "Cathodes", "Chemicals", "Current measurement", "Electrodes", "Instruments", "Monitoring", "Polarization", "Pollution measurement", ""], "arnumber": "4103075"}
