The tracking system considered is a generalization of a type-II phase-lock loop where the phase detector characteristic is a general function. In order to improve the acquisition characteristics, the natural evolution of the local oscillator is modified by a command signal chosen in order to minimize the acquisition time, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to maximize the lock-in range and the capture range of the tracking system. The influence of the different parameters (input, damping, natural frequency, pha e characteristic,command signal) on the acquisition of the resulting systems has been pr\u00c3\u00a9cised by means of a theoretical study of the trajectories in the phase plane and by an analog simulation. A simple criterion adopted in order to characterize the acquisition of a system disturbed by noise permits the study of the influence of S/N ratio on acquisition time.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "369", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "375", "date_publication": "May 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "369 - 375", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Daniel Ludwig", "Michel Lecours"], "keywords": ["Damping", "Detectors", "Frequency synchronization", "Gaussian noise", "Integrated circuit noise", "Local oscillators", "Phase detection", "Signal synthesis", "Tracking loops", "Voltage-controlled oscillators", ""], "arnumber": "4103139"}
