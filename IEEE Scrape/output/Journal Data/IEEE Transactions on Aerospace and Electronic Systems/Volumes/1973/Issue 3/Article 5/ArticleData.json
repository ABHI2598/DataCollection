The design procedure assumes the logarithm of the clutter power varies as a polynomial with range. When the actual environment matches the design environment, the false-alarm rate is a constant that is independent of the polynomial coefficients. A measure of the relative target detection capability as a function of the number of normalization cells and the degree of the design-environment polynomial is given. The applicability of the processors to non-Rayleigh clutter is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "399", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "405", "date_publication": "May 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "399 - 405", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
