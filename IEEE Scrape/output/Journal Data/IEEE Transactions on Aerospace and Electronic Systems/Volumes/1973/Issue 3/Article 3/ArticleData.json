Simple analytical expressions in terms of the circuit components are derived for the characteristic transient and frequency responses of time-average(continuous) power-stage models for use in designing and understanding the behavior of corresponding switched power stages. Novel conclusions include the dependence of effective circuit component values upon switch duty ratio and the existence of a real positive zero in certain transfer functions. Responses from analog computer simulations of the switched and averaged powerstages agree well and, in turn, confirm the analytic predictions. High-order systems can be analyzed by the averaging technique without a commensurate increase in complexity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "376", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "385", "date_publication": "May 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "376 - 385", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["G.
