The aided track signals are derived in an inertial space format and are generated from a Kalman filter algorithm. Computational results are included to show the interplay between the conventional pointing system and the aided track filter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "350", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "368", "date_publication": "May 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "350 - 368", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["John Murray Fitts"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Azimuth", "Coordinate measuring machines", "Filters", "Noise measurement", "Sampling methods", "Sensor systems", "Signal generators", "Target tracking", "Tracking loops", ""], "arnumber": "4103138"}
