The performance of the DD detector is represented by probability of error PE versus input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To examine how much improvement in performance can beachieved with this technique, PE's with and without DD feedback are evaluated in parallel. Further, analytical results are compared with those found by Monte Carlo simulations. The results are shown in good agreement.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "442", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "447", "date_publication": "May 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "442 - 447", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
