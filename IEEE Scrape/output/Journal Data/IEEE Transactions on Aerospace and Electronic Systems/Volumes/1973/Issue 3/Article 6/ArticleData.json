The method utilizes multiple measurements of the tilt-table azimuth alignment error with different inertial platforms to determine a best estimate of the alignment error. Error analysis indicates that useful facility performance can be obtained with only a small number of measurements. The tilt-tablealignment accuracy can be improved as more measurements of the alignment error are made during normal facility operation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "406", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "411", "date_publication": "May 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "406 - 411", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Gordon E.
