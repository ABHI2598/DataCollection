In this paper, we treat signal interference for both an amplitude-and an angle-modulation communication system. The input to the half-wave linear detector is assumed to be composed of an amplitude-modulated wave, an angle-modulated wave, and narrow-band Gaussian noise. In particular, when strongweak relations exist in the input processes, a detailed analysis for the output component is presented to clarify some useful output properties.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "412", "volume": "AES-9", "lastpage": "420", "date_publication": "May 1973", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "date": "May 1973", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "412 - 420", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Norihiko Morinaga", "Kotaro Kawamura", "Toshihiko Namekawa"], "keywords": ["Band pass filters", "Demodulation", "Detectors", "Frequency conversion", "Gaussian noise", "Interference", "Mobile communication", "Narrowband", "Signal analysis", "Signal to noise ratio", ""], "arnumber": "4103144"}
