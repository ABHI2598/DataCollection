The device is fabricated by means of micromachining techniques and is made up of a silicon die and a borosilicate glass cover joined together by means of anodic bonding. The fabrication process of two different versions of the device is described. The gas mass flow dependence on both the inlet pressure and the absolute temperature is measured and discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "982", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "988", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416151", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "982 - 988", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
