A unique heterodyne correlation technique based on a delayed transmitted waveform using a photonic delay line has been used to inject coherence within this system. The performance of this radar in the presence of ground reflections is investigated analytically and experimentally, and the mitigating effects of UWB waveform on multipath-induced interference are analyzed. In addition, the ground clutter statistics, in a look-down mode, are theoretically established and experimentally verified. The performance of this radar in detecting clutter embedded targets with small radar cross section (RCS) is also experimentally examined.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "838", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "853", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416141", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "838 - 853", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["N.
