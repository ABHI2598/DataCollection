In multisensor tracking systems that operate in a centralized manner, there are usually different time delays in transmitting the scans or frames from the various sensors to the center. This can lead to situations where measurements from the same target arrive out of sequence. Such \"out-of-sequence\" measurement (OOSM) arrivals can occur even in the absence of scan/frame communication time delays. The resulting \"negative-time measurement update\" problem, which is quite common in real multisensor systems, was solved previously only approximately in the literature. The exact state update equation for such a problem is presented. The optimal and two suboptimal algorithms are compared on a number of realistic examples, including a GMTI (ground moving target indicator) radar case.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "769", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "777", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416136", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "769 - 777", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Y.
