Based on an analysis of the effects of Doppler mismatch on binary phase-coded waveforms, a class of codes is proposed (hereafter referred to as the component codes), its derivation and processing is described, and the performance results are analyzed. This technique solves the problem of the Doppler mismatch of binary phase-coded waveforms at the expense of about 3 dB loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This technique may be used in tracking applications, such as accurately and rapidly measuring and tracking targets of unknown speeds. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of this technique.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1068", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1072", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416161", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "1068 - 1072", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yuping Cheng", "Zheng Bao", "Fufu Zhao", "Zbeiping Lin"], "keywords": ["Doppler effect", "codes", "compensation", "filtering theory", "matched filters", "pulse compression", "radar signal processing", "radar tracking", "Doppler mismatch compensation", "SNR", "binary phase-coded waveforms", "phase-coded pulse compression waveforms", "radar", "signal-to-noise ratio", "tracking applications", "Digital filters", "Filtering", "Frequency", "Matched filters", "Performance analysis", "Pulse compression methods", "Radar tracking", "Signal to noise ratio", "Target tracking", "Velocity measurement", ""], "arnumber": "1039424"}
