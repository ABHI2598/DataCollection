A speed control scheme having two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) structure is developed here to improve the speed dynamic response of an SRM drive. In the proposed control scheme, the feedback controller is quantitatively designed to meet the desired regulation control requirements first. Then a reference model and a command feedforward controller based on an inverse plant model are employed to yield the desired tracking response at nominal case. As the variations of system parameters and operating conditions occur, the prescribed control specifications may not be satisfied any more. To improve this, the inverse model is adaptively tuned by a fuzzy control scheme so that the model-following tracking error is significantly reduced. In addition, a simple disturbance cancellation robust controller is added to improve the tracking and regulation control performances further.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "955", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "968", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416149", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "955 - 968", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["K.
