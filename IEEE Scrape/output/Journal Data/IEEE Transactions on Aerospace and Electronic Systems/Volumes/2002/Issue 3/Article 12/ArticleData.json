The tracking algorithm changes the duty ratio of the converter such that the solar cell array (SCA) voltage equals the voltage corresponding to the MP point at that solar insolation. This is done by the feedforward loop, which generates an error signal by comparing the instantaneous array voltage and reference voltage. The reference voltage for the feedforward loop, corresponding to the MP point, is obtained by an off-line trained neural network. Experimental data is used for off-line training of the neural network, which employs back-propagation algorithm. The proposed fuzzy feedforward peak power tracking effectiveness is demonstrated through the simulation and experimental results, and compared with the conventional proportional plus integral (PI) controller based system. Finally, a comparative study of interleaved boost and conventional boost converter for the PV applications is given and their suitability is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "969", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "981", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416150", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "969 - 981", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
