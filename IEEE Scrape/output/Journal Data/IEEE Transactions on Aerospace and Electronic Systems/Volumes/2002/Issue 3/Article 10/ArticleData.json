It can occur when the desired target is competing with a jammer, clutter, or multipath. Angle statistics can vary significantly for a tracking radar depending upon the nature of this interference. The angular mean and variance are presented for three different statistical two-target types for single and multiple measurements. Previously derived values are presented for completeness in conjunction with derivations not found in the open literature. The signal-to-noise ratio is assumed to be large so that the effects of receiver noise may be neglected.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1038", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1046", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416156", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "1038 - 1046", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
