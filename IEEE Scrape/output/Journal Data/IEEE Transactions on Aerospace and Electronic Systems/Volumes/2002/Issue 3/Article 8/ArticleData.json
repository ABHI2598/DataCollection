With the aid of neutral point clamped scheme, a three-level voltage pattern is generated on the AC side of the proposed rectifier. To track the tine current command derived from a voltage controller and a phase-locked loop circuit, a hysteresis current control scheme is used in the inner loop control. A capacitor voltage compensator is employed to achieve the balanced neutral point voltage. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, the simulation and experimental results based on a laboratory prototype circuit are performed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1000", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1010", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416153", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "1000 - 1010", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bor-Ren Lin", "Tsung-Liang Hung"], "keywords": ["AC-DC power convertors", "PWM power convertors", "compensation", "power factor", "PWM control schemes", "balanced neutral point voltage", "capacitor voltage compensator", "hysteresis current control scheme", "inner loop control", "pulsewidth modulation schemes", "single-phase AC/DC converter", "sinusoidal line current", "three-level voltage pattern", "unity power factor", "AC generators", "Circuits", "DC-DC power converters", "Phase locked loops", "Pulse width modulation", "Pulse width modulation converters", "Reactive power", "Rectifiers", "Tracking loops", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "1039416"}
