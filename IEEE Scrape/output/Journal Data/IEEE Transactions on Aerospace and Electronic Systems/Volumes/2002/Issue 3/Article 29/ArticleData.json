SLB employs an auxiliary antenna channel with the output being compared with that of the main antenna channel and a decision is then made as to whether or not to blank the main channel output. SLB performance determination involves the evaluation of several probability functions. Based on the classical Maisel SLB architecture, this work extends previous performance results, in which detection was limited to the case of a single radar pulse with either Marcum or Swerling I target fluctuation. Probability expressions have been generalized to include both an arbitrary number of integrated pulses and target fluctuation models based on the gamma distribution. The Swerling fluctuation models are all special cases of the gamma distribution. Results are derived in terms of two generalized probability functions, one for detection and the other for blanking. With these generalized probability functions, the SLB design and performance results can be determined. Examples are presented and discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1023", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1037", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416155", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "1023 - 1037", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
