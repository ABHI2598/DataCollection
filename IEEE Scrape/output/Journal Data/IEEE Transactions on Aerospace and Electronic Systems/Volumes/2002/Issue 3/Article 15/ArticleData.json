First, the structure and operating principle of the PMLSM are described in detail. Second, a field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive is introduced. Then, each segment of the multisegment switching surfaces is designed to match the corresponding part of the trapezoidal velocity profile, thus the motor dynamics on the specified-segment switching surface have the desired velocity or acceleration corresponding part of the trapezoidal velocity profile. In addition, the proposed control system is implemented in a PC-based computer control system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed PMLSM servo drive system is demonstrated by some simulated and experimental results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1011", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1022", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416154", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "1011 - 1022", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Faa-Jeng Lin", "Kuo-Kai Shyu", "Chih-Hong Lin"], "keywords": ["linear synchronous motors", "motion control", "permanent magnet motors", "servomotors", "variable structure systems", "field-oriented control", "incremental motion control", "linear synchronous motor", "motor dynamics", "multisegment sliding mode control", "multisegment switching surfaces", "permanent magnet motor", "servo drive system", "trapezoidal velocity profile", "Acceleration", "Aerodynamics", "Control systems", "Drives", "Machine tools", "Motion control", "Servomechanisms", "Sliding mode control", "Synchronous motors", "Velocity control", ""], "arnumber": "1039417"}
