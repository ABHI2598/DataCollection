Criteria for efficient organization of the on-board database are discussed with reference to a brightness-independent initial acquisition algorithm. Star catalog generation preprocessing is described, with emphasis on the identification of minimum star brightness for detection by a sensor based on a charge coupled device (CCD) photodetector. This is a crucial step for proper evaluation of the attainable sky coverage when selecting the stars to be included in the on-board catalog. Test results are also reported, both for reliability and accuracy, even if the former is considered to be the primary target. Probability of erroneous solution is 0.2% in the case of single runs of the procedure, while attitude determination accuracy is in the order of 0.02\u00b0 in the average for the computation of the inertial pointing of the boresight axis.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "813", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "823", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416139", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "813 - 823", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
