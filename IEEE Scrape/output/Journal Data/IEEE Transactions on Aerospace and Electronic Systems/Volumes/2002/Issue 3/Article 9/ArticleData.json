The line-following guidance is designed using an LQR (linear quadratic regulator). Then, the optimal waypoint changing points are derived by minimizing the accelerations required for changing the waypoint line segments. Also derived is a sufficient condition for the stability bound of ground speed changes based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively guide a vehicle along the sequence of waypoint line segments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1116", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1120", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416167", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "1116 - 1120", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Ick Ho Whang", "Tae Won Hwang"], "keywords": ["Lyapunov methods", "aircraft control", "linear quadratic control", "military aircraft", "missile guidance", "stability", "LQR", "Lyapunov stability theorem", "attack directions", "ground speed changes", "horizontal waypoint guidance algorithm", "line-following guidance", "linear quadratic regulator", "optimal waypoint changing points", "stability bound", "target location arrival time", "terrain masking", "threat avoidance", "unmanned flying vehicle", "waypoint line segments", "Acceleration", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Kinematics", "Lyapunov method", "Navigation", "Optimal control", "Regulators", "Stability analysis", "Sufficient conditions", "Vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "1039430"}
