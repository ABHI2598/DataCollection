In practice, its performance turns out to be at best similar to that of the probabilistic data association filter (PDAF); and since the implementation of the PDAF is less intense numerically the PMHT has been having a hard time finding acceptance. The PMHT's problems of nonadaptivity, narcissism, and over-hospitality to clutter are elicited in this work. The PMHT's main selling-point is its flexible and easily modifiable model, which we use to develop the \"homothetic\" PMHT; maneuver-based PMHTs, including those with separate and joint homothetic measurement models; a modified PMHT whose measurement/target association model is more similar to that of the PDAF; and PMHTs with eccentric and/or estimated measurement models. Ideally, \"bottom line\" would be a version of the PMHT with clear advantages over existing trackers. If the goal is of an accurate (in terms of mean square error (MSE)) track, then there are a number of versions for which this is available.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "738", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "754", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416134", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "738 - 754", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
