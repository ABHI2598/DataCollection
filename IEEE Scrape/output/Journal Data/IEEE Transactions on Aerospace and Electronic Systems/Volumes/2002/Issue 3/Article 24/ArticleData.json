The characteristics of routing algorithms are first described as well as the specificities of routing in constellations of nongeostationary (NGO) satellites equipped with intersatellite links (ISLs). Then, some of the candidate algorithms displaying the characteristics identified before are simulated and evaluated for different constellations. From the simulation results, it appears that (1) from a routing perspective, constellations are not similar to terrestrial networks, and (2) the constellation geometry has a significant impact on the routing performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "902", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "917", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7416145", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "902 - 917", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["L.
