In this paper, smart flight control surfaces are designed using multi-node microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to displace control surfaces and change the surface geometry. These MEMS augment translational motion microstructures (actuators-sensors), controlling/signal processing integrated circuits (ICs), radiating energy devices and antennas. The desired pitch, roll, and yaw moments are produced, drag can be reduced, and unsteady aerodynamic flows are controlled by smart flight control surfaces. That is, we achieve aerodynamic moment and active flow control capabilities. The major objective here is to report fundamental and applied research in design of smart flight control surfaces with MEMS-based actuator-sensor-IC arrays controlled by hierarchical distributed systems. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of smart flight control surfaces for coordinated longitudinal and lateral vehicle control", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "543", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "552", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303984", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "543 - 552", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
