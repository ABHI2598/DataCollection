The resulting \"homodyned-K\" backscatter model is a generalization of the classic Rayleigh-Rice model and has applications in radar, sonar, optics, and ultrasonic medical imaging. This paper presents exact and asymptotic equations for the probability density function, survival function, moments, and parameter estimation. The exact equations are expressed as infinite series. Also provided are proof of the series' convergence and guidance for their numerical computation. Examples illustrating the model's application to radar and sonar are presented using electromagnetic and acoustic backscatter data.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "527", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "542", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303983", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "527 - 542", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["D.
