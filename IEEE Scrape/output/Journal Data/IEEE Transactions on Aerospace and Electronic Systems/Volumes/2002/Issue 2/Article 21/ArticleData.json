Neural networks are used to approximate the optimal feedback strategy suitable for real-time implementation. The fact that the optimal trajectory in the 3D space does not deviate much from a vertical plane justifies the use of the two-dimensional (2D) neural network method previously studied. To regulate the lateral errors in the missile motion produced by the prediction error of the intercept point, the method of feedback linearization is employed. Computer simulations confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme over linear quadratic regulator guidance and proportional navigation guidance as well as its approximating capability of the optimal trajectory in the 3D space", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "404", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "414", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303974", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "404 - 414", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["Runge-Kutta methods", "boundary-value problems", "control system synthesis", "feedback", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "linearisation techniques", "missile guidance", "neurocontrollers", "performance index", "quadratic programming", "suboptimal control", "Earth-centered Earth-fixed frame", "Keplerian orbit", "Runge-Kutta approach", "atmospheric drag", "ballistic targets interception", "feedback linearization", "free-fall targets", "ground-based defense systems", "inequality constraints", "intercept point prediction error", "lateral errors", "missile motion", "neural networks", "nonlinear two-point boundary value problem", "nonmaneuvering targets", "optimal control problem", "optimal feedback strategy", "performance index", "real-time implementation", "sequential quadratic programming", "spherical Earth model", "suboptimal midcourse guidance law", "three-dimensional midcourse guidance", "three-dimensional space", "thrust profile", "time-to-go estimator", "vertical-plane guidance", "Aerospace engineering", "Artificial neural networks", "Computer errors", "Computer simulation", "Missiles", "Neural networks", "Neurofeedback", "Robustness", "Space technology", "Trajectory", ""], "arnumber": "1008975"}
