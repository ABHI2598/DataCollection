They are derived using two techniques: (1) Pade approximations to the multidimensional characteristic function (CF), and (2) discrete Rayleigh mixtures based on an exact or approximate form of the Rayleigh parameter probability density function. The Pade-based approximations are used for modeling the \"clutter-only\" case and computing detection thresholds, whereas the Rayleigh mixtures are best suited for modeling the \"target-plus-clutter\" case and computing target detection probabilities", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "621", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "632", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7324730", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "621 - 632", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["Bessel functions", "Hankel transforms", "filtering theory", "matched filters", "probability", "radar clutter", "radar detection", "radar signal processing", "Bessel function", "Hankel transform pair", "Pade approximations", "Rayleigh mixtures", "Rayleigh parameter probability density function", "clutter-only case", "detection thresholds", "echolocation systems", "fluctuation model", "line-of-sight target", "linear sums", "matched-filter amplitude probability functions", "matched-filter outputs", "multidimensional characteristic function", "multiple observations", "multivariate statistical functions", "radar clutter", "range resolution", "receiver operating characteristic curves", "search mode", "signal-to-clutter ratio", "single-observation detection problem", "statistical functions", "target detection probabilities", "target-plus-clutter case", "Computer vision", "Delay effects", "Impedance matching", "Matched filters", "Multidimensional systems", "Object detection", "Probability density function", "Random variables", "Signal processing", "Statistics", ""], "arnumber": "1008991"}
