Results obtained indicate that we can meet all the presently known spacecraft pointing requirements. A large number of derived requirements are generated from this study. Examples are specifications on attitude determination sensors, attitude control actuators, minimum settling time after a rest-to-rest spacecraft slew. Preliminary error budgets constructed in this study must be updated to reflect the changing spacecraft design and requirements", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "502", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "514", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303981", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "502 - 514", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
