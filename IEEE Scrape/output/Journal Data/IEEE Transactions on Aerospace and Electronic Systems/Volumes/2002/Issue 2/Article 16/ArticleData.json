The simulator main goal is to reproduce, in an assigned volume about its geometrical center, a magnetic field vector with assigned uniformity and time behavior. To this end, different geometrical configurations, in terms of coil shape, dimension, number and distance, are analyzed. Results show that an optimum configuration, in terms of test volume dimensions and maximum power consumption, can be found", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "488", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "501", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303980", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "488 - 501", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
