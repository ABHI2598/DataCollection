Applying geometric techniques, we obtain robustness measures which allow the computation of the approximate change in overall false alarm probability and overall detection probability as the corresponding sensor probabilities are perturbed from these nominal values. We consider both the situation where all sensors experience perturbation and the situation where only one sensor is perturbed. Our analysis is based on local (linearized) methods which are valid for only small perturbations, but we also extend these methods to the more practical nonlocal case where larger perturbations are admitted", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "675", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "681", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303994", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "675 - 681", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["binomial distribution", "distributed sensors", "sensor fusion", "signal detection", "Neyman-Pearson test", "approximate change", "binary hypothesis testing", "binomial distribution", "data fusion", "decision fusion", "distributed sensor systems", "intuitive geometric concept", "local methods", "local robustness measures", "nonlocal robustness measures", "overall detection probability", "overall false alarm probability", "small perturbations", "Bayesian methods", "Equations", "Interference", "Robustness", "Sensor fusion", "Sensor systems", "Sensor systems and applications", "Signal processing algorithms", "Statistical distributions", "System testing", ""], "arnumber": "1008996"}
