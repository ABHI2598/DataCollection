For estimation purposes we resort to range cells in spatial proximity with that under test and assume that these cells, free of signal components, can be clustered into groups of data with one and the same value of the texture. We prove that, plugging the proposed estimator of the structure of the covariance matrix into a previously derived detector, based upon the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), leads to an adaptive detector which ensures the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property with respect to the clutter covariance matrix as well as the statistics of the texture. Finally, we show that this adaptive receiver has an acceptable loss with respect to its nonadaptive counterpart in cases of relevant interest for radar applications", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "415", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "426", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303975", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "415 - 426", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["E.
