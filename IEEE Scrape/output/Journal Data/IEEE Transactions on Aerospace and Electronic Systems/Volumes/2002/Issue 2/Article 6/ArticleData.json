This framework allows comparisons to be made on an even footing while minimizing the impact of implementation details and accounts for variation in image sizes, in angular resolution, and in the sizes of orientation windows used for training. Alternate approaches to ATR are characterized in terms of the best achievable performance as a function of the complexity of the model parameter database. Several approaches to ATR from SAR images are described and the performance achievable by each for a range of database complexities is studied and compared. These approaches are based on a likelihood test under a conditionally Gaussian model, log-magnitude least squared error, and quarter power least squared error. All approaches are evaluated for a wide range of parameterizations and the dependence on these parameters of both the resulting performance and the resulting database complexity is explored. Databases for all of the approaches are trained using identical sets of images and their performance is assessed under identical testing scenarios in terms of probability of correct classification, confusion matrices, and orientation estimation error. The results indicate that the conditionally Gaussian approach outperforms the other two approaches on average for both target recognition and orientation estimation, that accounting for radar power fluctuation improves performance for all three methods, and that the conditionally Gaussian approach normalized for power delivers average performance that is equal or superior to all other considered approaches", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "632", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "648", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303990", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "632 - 648", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["Gaussian distribution", "computational complexity", "covariance matrices", "image recognition", "image segmentation", "least squares approximations", "maximum likelihood estimation", "radar clutter", "radar computing", "radar imaging", "radar target recognition", "synthetic aperture radar", "Bayesian approach", "angular resolution", "automatic target recognition", "conditionally Gaussian model", "confusion matrices", "covariance matrix", "likelihood test", "log-magnitude least squared error", "model parameter database", "optimal segmentation", "orientation windows", "performance complexity", "probability of correct classification", "quarter power least squared error", "radar power fluctuation", "synthetic aperture radar images", "Aerospace testing", "Electronic equipment testing", "Estimation error", "Fluctuations", "Image databases", "Image resolution", "Radar imaging", "Synthetic aperture radar", "System testing", "Target recognition", ""], "arnumber": "1008992"}
