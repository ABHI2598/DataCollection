The given converter utilizes component parasitic parameters, particularly for the high-voltage transformer, and employs fixed-frequency phase-shift control to implement soft-switching commutations. Detailed steady state analysis of the converter power stage is presented for the first time and the major features of the converter's power stage are discussed. Small-signal characteristics are also presented and accompanied by a discussion of the controller design and implementation. A design example is also presented based on the steady state analysis and is validated by simulation. Theoretical and simulated results are in good agreement", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "515", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "526", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303982", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "515 - 526", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C.
