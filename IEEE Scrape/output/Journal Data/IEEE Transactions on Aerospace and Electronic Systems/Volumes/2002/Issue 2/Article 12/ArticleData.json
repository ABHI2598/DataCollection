The method covers losses due to the inductor's resistance and due to the voltage drops across the switch and the diode. The method is demonstrated by considering an average model that is applicable to both current conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operations, and the switching from one to the other is automatic. The large-signal model is SPICE compatible and as such can be used to run DC (steady state), TRAN (large signal, time domain) and AC (small signal, frequency domain) analyses", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "681", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "687", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303995", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "681 - 687", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "PWM power convertors", "SPICE", "equivalent circuits", "frequency-domain analysis", "losses", "time-domain analysis", "AC analyses", "DC analyses", "SPICE compatible", "conduction losses", "current conduction mode", "discontinuous conduction mode", "filter capacitors", "frequency domain", "generalized switched inductor model", "large-signal model", "method of average modeling", "pulsewidth modulation converters", "steady state", "time domain", "topology-independent equivalent circuit", "voltage drops", "Diodes", "Frequency domain analysis", "Inductors", "Pulse width modulation", "Pulse width modulation converters", "SPICE", "Steady-state", "Switches", "Time domain analysis", "Voltage", ""], "arnumber": "1008997"}
