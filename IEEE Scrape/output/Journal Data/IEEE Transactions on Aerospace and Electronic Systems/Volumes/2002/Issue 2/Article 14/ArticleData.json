The consecutive pulses are assumed to be fluctuating according to the Swerling I model. Exact expressions are derived for the detection probability of the conventional mean-level detector (MLD) and its modified versions under Rayleigh fluctuating target model. Performance for independent sweeps can be easily obtained by setting the sweep-to-sweep correlation coefficient equal to zero. Results are obtained for both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous background environments. It is shown that for fixed M, the relative improvement over the single sweep case increases as the correlation between sweeps decreases. For the same parameter values, the minimum MLD has the best performance in the presence of extraneous target returns among the reference noise samples", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "354", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "366", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7303970", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "354 - 366", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
