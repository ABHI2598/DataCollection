An ad hoc scheme is developed. Its stages include the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), a multiresolution decomposition in the frequency domain, and a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). The computational load is light, and the performance is remarkably good. This is so not just in the original narrowband situation, but also, due to an inherent adaptivity to the data, in the detection of signals that are relatively broadband in nature. Generalizations are given to constant false alarm rate (CFAR) operation in both prewhitened and unwhitened cases, and to the detection of multiband signals. As regards the last, it is discovered that there is little loss from overestimating the number of bands", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "211", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "227", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234756", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "211 - 227", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Zhen Wang", "P.
