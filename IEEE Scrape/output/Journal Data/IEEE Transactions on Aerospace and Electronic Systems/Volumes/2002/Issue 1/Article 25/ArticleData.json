The sidelobes can be greatly reduced by a deconvolution technique called Coherent CLEAN. The Coherent CLEAN algorithm is based on the assumption that the scene consists of isolated and independent targets. However, many real-life targets are contiguous. Even if we approximate the contiguous targets by very closely spaced point sources, they can hardly be assumed to radiate independently. The sidelobes and the mainlobes of these closely spaced point sources can interact constructively and destructively causing spurious peaks and peak mislocations. These problems are studied and a variation in the existing Coherent CLEAN algorithm, called Sequence CLEAN, is proposed. Sequence CLEAN is found to work well with actual targets", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "89", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "97", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234746", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "89 - 97", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["R.
