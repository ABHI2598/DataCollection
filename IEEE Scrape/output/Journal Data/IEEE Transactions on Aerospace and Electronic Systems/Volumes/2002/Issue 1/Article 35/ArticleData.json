They are called R (ratio), S (substract) and P (plus) types. For a two-sensor network and local order statistics CFAR (OS-CFAR) algorithm, we derive their closed-form expressions for false alarm and detection probabilities of detecting a Swerling II target in Gaussian noise. The numerical results show that \u03c1, the ratio between the noise power levels in two local sensors, has very strong effects on the performances of the S and P type schemes and the centralized detection. They can't hold to be CFAR when there isn't the precise prior knowledge of \u03c1. Compared with the centralized detection, the distributed detection scheme is more robust for the effect of \u03c1. Fortunately, the R type scheme is not affected by the \u03c1 at all. It implies that the local CFAR processing can immunize the distributed detection against the \u03c1", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "278", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "288", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234762", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "278 - 288", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Jian Guan", "Ying-Ning Peng", "You He", "Xiang-Wei Meng"], "keywords": ["Gaussian noise", "radar detection", "radar theory", "Gaussian noise", "OS-CFAR algorithm", "Swerling II target", "centralized detection", "constant false-alarm rate detection", "detection probability", "distributed detection", "false alarm probability", "independent identically distributed sensors", "local test statistic", "noise power level", "plus type scheme", "radar target detection", "ratio type scheme", "substract type scheme", "two-sensor network", "Background noise", "Closed-form solution", "Computer languages", "Detectors", "Gaussian noise", "Global Positioning System", "Radar detection", "Statistical analysis", "Statistical distributions", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "993247"}
