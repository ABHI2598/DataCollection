The proposed system uses six accelerometers mounted diagonally on each surface of a cubic. The system proposed herein exploits additional information involving the gravity effect, allowing us to determine the angular velocity. It also provides an upper bound value to initiate the platform attitude. In addition, an estimation algorithm using the own-ship trajectory estimator providing a measurement likelihood is proposed. A simulation case for estimating position and velocity of the vehicle is investigated by this approach. Results confirm the effectiveness of this information infusing concept in obtaining a convergent INS state estimation", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "339", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "346", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234771", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "339 - 346", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Sou-Chen Lee", "Yu-Chao Huang"], "keywords": ["accelerometers", "aircraft navigation", "inertial navigation", "state estimation", "all-accelerometer inertial navigation system", "angular velocity", "estimation method", "gravity effect", "measurement likelihood", "own-ship trajectory estimator", "platform attitude", "position estimation", "state estimation", "upper bound value", "velocity estimation", "Acceleration", "Accelerometers", "Angular velocity", "Gravity", "Gyroscopes", "Inertial navigation", "Integral equations", "Position measurement", "State estimation", "Velocity measurement", ""], "arnumber": "993257"}
