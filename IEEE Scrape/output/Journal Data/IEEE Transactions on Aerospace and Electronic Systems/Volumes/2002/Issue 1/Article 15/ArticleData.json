It has conceptual similarities to amplitude comparison monopulse systems used in tracking radars. Tripulse differs from monopulse in that it is applicable primarily to transmitting active phased arrays aboard communication satellites. The signaling structure consists of a minimum of three separate time multiplexed coherent pulses. A statistical performance analysis and a description of the methodology for converting multiple ground station orientation data to attitude estimates are presented", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234739", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "2 - 12", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
