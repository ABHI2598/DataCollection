Spacecraft moment of inertia distribution is represented in the form of product of inertia terms in the system inertia matrix. The product of inertia between orthogonal body axes of the satellite is used to build a controller which controls the nutational motion caused by the angular momentum of the wheel. The attitude controller in the pitch axis controlling the pitch motion as well as nutational dynamics in the roll/yaw planes is analyzed in detail. Analytic expressions using linearized equations are derived providing further insight into the dynamic coupling effect among orthogonal body axes", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "243", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "250", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234758", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "243 - 250", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Yochoong Bang", "Hyung Don Choi"], "keywords": ["aerospace control", "artificial satellites", "attitude control", "angular momentum", "attitude control", "bias momentum satellite", "dynamic coupling", "inertia matrix", "moment of inertia distribution", "nutational motion", "orthogonal body axis", "pitch motion", "spacecraft", "Aerodynamics", "Aerospace control", "Attitude control", "Communication system control", "Equations", "Motion control", "Satellites", "Space technology", "Space vehicles", "Wheels", ""], "arnumber": "993243"}
