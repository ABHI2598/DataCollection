An intermediate converter can therefore increase efficiency by matching the PV system to the load and by operating the solar cell arrays (SCAs) at their maximum power point. An MP point tracking algorithm is developed using only SCA voltage information thus leading to current sensorless tracking control. The inadequacy of a boost converter for array voltage based MP point control is experimentally verified and an improved converter system is proposed. The proposed converter system results in low ripple content, which improves the array performance and hence a lower value of capacitance is sufficient on the solar array side. Simplified mathematical expressions for a PV source are derived. A signal flow graph is employed for modeling the converter system. Current sensorless peak power tracking effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation results. Experimental results are presented to validate the proposed method", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "262", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "270", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234760", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "262 - 270", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
