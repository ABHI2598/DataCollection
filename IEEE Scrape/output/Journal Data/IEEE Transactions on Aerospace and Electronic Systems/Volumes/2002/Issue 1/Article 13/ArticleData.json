Because the wavelet transform possesses the time-frequency localization characteristics, the time and frequency information of a waveform can be integrally presented. Therefore, this approach can be more efficient in monitoring time-varying disturbances when compared with those Fourier transform-based methods. Moreover, when compared with the Morlet wavelet transform, the merits of easier implementation presented by Coiflet transform method as a discrete form further solidify the practicality for electric power quality applications. This approach has been validated through various test scenarios, including oscillatory transients, voltage sag, voltage swell, momentary interruption, and flat-top. Test results demonstrated the feasibility of the method for the applications considered", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "204", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "210", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234755", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "204 - 210", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Shyh-Jier Huang", "Cheng-Tao Hsieh"], "keywords": ["power system faults", "wavelet transforms", "Coiflet wavelet transform", "electric power quality", "flat-top", "momentary interruption", "oscillatory transient", "power system disturbance", "signal generation", "time-frequency localization", "time-varying disturbance", "voltage sag", "voltage swell", "Discrete wavelet transforms", "Fourier transforms", "Monitoring", "Power systems", "Signal analysis", "Testing", "Time frequency analysis", "Voltage fluctuations", "Voltage-controlled oscillators", "Wavelet transforms", ""], "arnumber": "993240"}
