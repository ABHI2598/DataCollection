XV. New direct method for construction of universal finite-dimensional filter", "abstract": "We consider the explicit solution of Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai (DMZ) equation for the finite-dimensional filtering system. We show that under certain conditions, the nonlinear filtering system can be solved explicitly with an arbitrary initial condition by solving a system of ordinary differential equations and a Kolmogorov-type equation. Let n be the dimension of state space. We show that we need only n sufficient statistics in order to solve the DMZ equation", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "50", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "57", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234743", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "50 - 57", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Guo-Qing Hu", "S.
