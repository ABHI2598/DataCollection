The purposes of prototype development are to examine the effectiveness and problems of the electronic FPS display in comparison to the current system and to identify the controller-workstation requirements, which are necessary to decide a future planning of a production prototype development. The evaluation and additional test were conducted for a typical en route transition sector. It was found that electronic FPS was useful in the normal traffic load. Some possible improvements were identified in the heavy traffic load situations represented in the additional test", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "119", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "127", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234748", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "119 - 127", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
