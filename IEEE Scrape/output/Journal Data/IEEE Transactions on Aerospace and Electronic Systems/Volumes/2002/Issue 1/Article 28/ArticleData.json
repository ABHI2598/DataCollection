We introduce a multiscale prescreener algorithm that runs as part of the image formation processing step for ultrawideband (UWB) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. The prescreener processes intermediate radar data generated by a quadtree backprojection image former. As the quadtree algorithm iterates, it is resolving increasingly finer subpatches of the scene. After each quadtree stage, the prescreener makes an estimate of the signal-to-background ratio of each subpatch and applies a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector to decide which ones might contain a target of interest. Whenever the prescreener determines that a subpatch is not near a detection, it cues the image former to terminate further processing of that subpatch. Using a small database of UWB radar field data, we demonstrate that the prescreener is able to decrease the overall computational load of the image formation process. We also show that the new multiscale prescreener method produces fewer false alarms than the conventional two-parameter CFAR prescreener applied to the completely formed image", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "74", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "88", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234745", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "74 - 88", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["L.
