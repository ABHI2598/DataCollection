Extensive amounts (over 20 min per measurement) of vertically and horizontally polarized sea clutter data were taken with upwind (UP) and crosswind (CR) transmit geometries during the collection campaign. Specific but representative examples of the clutter were statistically and phenomenologically analyzed over time scales varying from long (200 s), to intermediate (5 s), to short (50 ms), and over range swaths varying from full (160 m), to partial (30 m), to a single range cell (0.3 m). All analyses and results presented here are noncoherent, involving only the clutter amplitudes. Each type of clutter exhibited the characteristic spiky behavior which has come to be expected from microwave sea backscatter observed at low grazing angles and high range resolutions, while showing, between themselves, marked transmit geometry and polarization dependent contrasts, with the horizontally polarized clutter, measured with an UP transmit geometry, being especially notable for its frequently occurring, significant high frequency spectral content. Within the same clutter type, differences were observed in the probability distributions of radar cross sections (RCS) of spatially and temporally extended spiking events", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "58", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "73", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234744", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "58 - 73", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["F.
