Two spectrum matching detector (SMD) structures, which are implemented by correlogram and periodogram, respectively, are examined. Theoretical calculation of their false alarm rates is derived and confirmed by simulations. It is also demonstrated that the proposed detectors outperform the standard periodogram, Bartlett method, and energy detector under constant false alarm rate (CFAR) condition for two different random signals.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "301", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "307", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234766", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon May 23 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "301 - 307", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["H.
