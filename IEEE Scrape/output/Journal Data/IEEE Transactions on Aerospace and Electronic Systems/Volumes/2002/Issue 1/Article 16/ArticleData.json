One important factor in designing a navigation system is dilution of precision (DOP). We design a regional navigation system based on the simulations of the system's DOP. The system would consist of geosynchronous orbit satellites (GSO) and stratospheric airships for the urban areas. In the beginning stage, the system would augment the existing GPS constellation, and in the later stage with sufficient satellites and airships, we could achieve an independent alternative navigation system", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "271", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "278", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234761", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "271 - 278", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["C. -H.
