Low distortion of the input currents and high power factor are obtained applying near optimal current injection. The optimal current injection is discussed, and requirements it imposes to the current injection network are derived. A class of simple current injection networks that provide near optimal current injection, consisting of a transformer, two capacitors, and a number of resistors or resistance emulators is proposed. The power processed by the resistors or resistance emulators is shown to be 8.81% of the input power. Design of the current injection network is discussed, and dependence of the input current distortion on capacitance of the applied capacitors is analyzed. Volt-ampere rating of the transformer is shown to be only 0.16% of the input power. Effects caused by the output current ripple are studied, and a method for their compensation is proposed. Analytical results are experimentally verified. Switching resistance emulation is discussed and its feasibility is experimentally demonstrated", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "163", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "173", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234752", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "163 - 173", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
