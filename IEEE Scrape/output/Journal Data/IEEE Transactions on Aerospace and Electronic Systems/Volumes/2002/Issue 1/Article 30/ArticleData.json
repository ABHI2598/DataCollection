Fly-by-wire or fly-by-light control of EMFAs is performed by flight management systems (flight, mission, propulsion, and integrated controls that manage any combination of specific flight, mission, and propulsion functions). Reported here are novel results in the analysis of EMFAs with permanent-magnet synchronous motors, with particular interest in the application of brushless high-torque density motors which have superior characteristics compared with other state-of-the-art motor technologies. It is shown that due to nonlinearities and bounds, new control algorithms must be developed and implemented to achieve a spectrum of performance and requirements for EMFAs. A number of important issues in control, analysis, model development, integration, and verification are studied. Tracking control algorithms are synthesized, stability studied, and novel analysis results are reported. Advanced computer-aided engineering software tools and emerging simulation-based design environments are used to guarantee high fidelity modeling and analysis within data intensive simulation. Proof-of-concept demonstration testbeds for the design of advanced EMFAs and their components are developed, and EMFA imitator performance thoroughly studied. Verification of the concepts reported are formed and documented. Precise tracking, disturbance attenuation, accuracy, stability, robustness, and excellent acceleration capabilities are reported. A demonstration is performed to substantiate the theoretical analyses to add credence to its applicability as an approach and method that the designer of future EMFAs can use to design a new class of actuators for aircraft flight control surfaces", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "174", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "182", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234753", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "174 - 182", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["S.
