A recursive time-to-go computation method which updates the time-to-go in a noniterative way is presented. The recursive method includes an error compensation feature which explicitly computes the time-to-go error produced by nonzero initial heading errors. The proposed method is simple and straightforward to implement for any missile velocity profiles. Various numerical examples show that the proposed method works effectively for optimal guidance laws as well as proportional navigation and augmented proportional navigation", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7234740", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "13 - 24", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Min-Jea Tahk", "Chang-Kyung Ryoo", "Hangju Cho"], "keywords": ["error analysis", "error compensation", "missile guidance", "optimal control", "proportional control", "recursive estimation", "augmented proportional navigation", "error compensation feature", "homing guidance missiles", "missile velocity profiles", "noniterative method", "nonzero initial heading errors", "optimal guidance laws", "proportional navigation", "recursive method", "recursive time-to-go computation method", "recursive time-to-go estimation", "time-to-go error", "time-to-go estimates", "time-varying velocity missiles", "Aerospace engineering", "Degradation", "Error compensation", "Missiles", "Navigation", "Nonlinear equations", "Optimal control", "Recursive estimation", "Region 1", "Terrorism", ""], "arnumber": "993225"}
