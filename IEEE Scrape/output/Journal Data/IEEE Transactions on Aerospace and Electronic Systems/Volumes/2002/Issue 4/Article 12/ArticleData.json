As the frequency range expands, today's frontiers will be in full use tomorrow; the series provides the status and main achievements of the program to date. DAVID will pioneer the use of the W-band (94 GHz channel) for telecommunications experiments that can contribute to the exploitation of that frequency range for future high-capacity operational services.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1370", "volume": "38", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497159", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["multimedia communication", "satellite communication", "telecommunication channels", "94 GHz", "ASI", "Agenzia Spaziale Italiana", "DAVID mission", "Italian Space Agency", "W-band", "communications channels", "data and video interactive distribution programme", "frequency ranges", "high-capacity operational services", "operational systems", "telecommunications experiments", "Artificial satellites", "Astrophysics", "Communication channels", "Data analysis", "Frequency", "History", "Proposals", "Resource management", "Space missions", ""], "arnumber": "1145758"}
