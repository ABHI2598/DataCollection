The main reason for this is that in a practical (surveillance) tracker system there are a lot of design parameters and a lot of competing requirements to be met. An algorithm to tune a tracker system automatically and at the same time obtain quantitative results in terms of the optimality of the solution is provided here. The theory of randomized algorithms is used to obtain probabilistic statements on the quality of the output of the tuning process. A simplified example illustrates how the developed theory is to be used.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1444", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1449", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497171", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1444 - 1449", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Y.
