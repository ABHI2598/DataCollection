As has been proved in a previous paper by Pena et al. (see ibid., vol. 36, no. 3, 2000), there exist configurations of 6 thrusters which can achieve this task, even under the failure of any one of them. Nevertheless, that previous result only presents analysis conditions and furthermore its implementation would demand also 6 valves, one for each thruster. Here we propose a design method that can solve the aforementioned problem with 6 thrusters/3 valves.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1172", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1180", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497143", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1172 - 1180", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["P.
