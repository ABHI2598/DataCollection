The voltage stress of each power semiconductor of the adopted rectifier is equal to the half dc bus voltage instead of full dc link voltage in the conventional switching mode rectifier. The control signals of the power switches are derived from the dc link voltage balance compensator, line current controller, and dc link voltage regulator. The hysteresis current control scheme is employed to draw a clean sinusoidal line current, high input power factor, regulated dc link voltage, and balance capacitor voltages. Three voltage levels are generated on the ac terminal of the adopted rectifier. To verify the proposed operation scheme, performance characteristics are given by the experimental results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1287", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1294", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497152", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1287 - 1294", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Bor-Ren Lin", "Der-Jan Chen", "Tsung-Liang Hung"], "keywords": ["bridge circuits", "power factor correction", "rectifying circuits", "voltage regulators", "balance capacitor voltages", "clean sinusoidal line current", "dc link voltage balance compensator", "dc link voltage regulator", "half-bridge clamped rectifier", "hysteresis current control scheme", "input power factor", "line current controller", "neutral point diode", "power factor correction", "power semiconductor", "regulated dc link voltage", "voltage stress", "Hysteresis", "Power factor correction", "Power semiconductor switches", "Reactive power", "Rectifiers", "Regulators", "Semiconductor diodes", "Stress", "Thyristors", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "1145750"}
