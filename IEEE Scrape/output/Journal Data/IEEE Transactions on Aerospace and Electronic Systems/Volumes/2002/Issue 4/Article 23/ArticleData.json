Various adaptive detection test statistics such as the adaptive matched filter (AMF), the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and adaptive coherence estimate (ACE), and combinations of these, have been previously analyzed with respect to their sidelobe rejection capabilities. In contrast to these methods which are based on detecting a single target with known direction and Doppler, the present method uses model order determination techniques applied to the AMF or GLRT data observed over the range of unknown angle and Doppler parameters. The determination of model order, i.e., the number of signals present in the data, is made by using least-squares model fit error residuals and applying the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Comprehensive computer simulation results are presented which demonstrate substantial improvement in sidelobe rejection performance and detections of multiple sources compared with previous methods.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1399", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1407", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497163", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1399 - 1407", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["Doppler radar", "adaptive radar", "least squares approximations", "radar detection", "radar resolution", "Akaike Information Criterion", "Doppler parameters", "adaptive coherence estimate", "adaptive detection test statistics", "adaptive matched filter", "adaptive radar system", "adaptive resolution", "computer simulation", "generalized likelihood ratio test", "least squares method", "mainlobe detection", "model order determination", "multiple source detection", "sidelobe detection", "sidelobe rejection", "Airborne radar", "Array signal processing", "Clutter", "Detection algorithms", "Matched filters", "Maximum likelihood detection", "Radar detection", "Reverberation", "Statistical analysis", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "1145763"}
