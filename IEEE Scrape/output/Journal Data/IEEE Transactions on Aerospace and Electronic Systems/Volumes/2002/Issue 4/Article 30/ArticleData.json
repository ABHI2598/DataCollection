A combined acoustic propagation and sensor (CAPS) performance prediction model specifying the conditional density of the SNR measurements is assumed given; however, mismatch may exist between the CAPS model and the real world. We present a novel \"missing data\" formulation of the augmented bearings-only TMA problem using an empirical maximum a posteriori (EMAP) method for target parameter estimation, and show that it provides a natural and straightforward technique for mitigating CAPS model mismatch. The EMAP approach leads to an iteratively reweighted, linear least-squares algorithm for solving both the augmented bearings-only TMA problem and the classical (nonaugmented) bearings-only TMA problem.
