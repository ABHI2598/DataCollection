Under this control strategy, the inductor current and the diode current of the boost converter are fed back and combined in a special way which makes the input current of the AC-to-DC converter stable and robust. The input current is solely determined by the reference current. When the reference current signal is derived from the sinusoidal input voltage, the input current is sinusoidal and in phase with the input voltage. Theoretical analysis is first provided. Small signal analysis shows that the current loop is inherently stable and has a fast dynamic response. Large signal analysis reveals that the control system is not affected by large disturbances in supply voltage or output load. Computer simulations have been carried out and experimental prototype models have been built to verify the analysis and demonstrate the feasibility of the control strategy. A power factor of 0.998 and a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 3.18% are measured.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1210", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1219", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497146", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1210 - 1219", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Zaohong Yang", "P.
