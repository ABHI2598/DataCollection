First, an adaptive observation system with an inverse rotor time-constant observer is derived on the basis of model reference adaptive system (MRAS) theory to preserve the decoupling control characteristic of an indirect field-oriented IM drive. The adaptive observation system is implemented using a digital signal processor (DSP) with a high sampling rate to make it possible to achieve good dynamics. Moreover, a robust control system is developed based on the principle of computed torque control. In the robust control system, a grey uncertainty predictor is utilized to adapt the lumped uncertainty on line to relax the requirement of the lumped uncertainty in the design of a computed torque speed controller. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed observation and control systems is verified by simulated and experimental results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1357", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1369", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497158", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1357 - 1369", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Rong-Jong Wai", "Li-Jung Chang"], "keywords": ["angular velocity control", "induction motor drives", "machine control", "model reference adaptive control systems", "observers", "robust control", "torque control", "computed torque control", "favorable decoupling control", "grey uncertainty predictor", "high-precision speed tracking property", "indirect field-oriented IM drive", "induction motor drive", "inverse rotor time-constant observer", "lumped uncertainty", "model reference adaptive system", "robust control system", "sampling rate", "tracking control", "Adaptive control", "Adaptive systems", "Control systems", "Induction motor drives", "Induction motors", "Programmable control", "Robust control", "Rotors", "Torque control", "Uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "1145756"}
