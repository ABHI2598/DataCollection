Theoretical limits are derived for the performance of classical and unbiased conversion techniques using the expected normalized error squared as a function of bearing uncertainty and the ratio of range to range uncertainty. The unbiased measurement conversion is shown to be more consistent than the classical measurement conversion with respect to range and bearing uncertainty.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1441", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1444", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497170", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1441 - 1444", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["F.
