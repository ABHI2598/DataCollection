The experiment envisages adaptively varying the robustness of signals down-transmitted, to a set (16) of Earth terminals by acting on their coding and spreading. During the DAVID satellite passes, each terminal determines autonomously its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and transmits it to a central station which, by using this information, works out the parameters for the global system optimization and indicates, in real time, to the terminals which code and despreading factor they must utilize to receive the part of the signal addressed to them.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1388", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1397", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497162", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1388 - 1397", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["A.
