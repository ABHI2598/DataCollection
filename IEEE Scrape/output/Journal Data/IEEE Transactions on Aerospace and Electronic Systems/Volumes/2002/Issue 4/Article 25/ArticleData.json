It is shown that the system A-matrix for odd order LC resonant converters (neglecting all the parasitic resistances) is always singular. As a consequence, all the third order LC resonant converters in dc-dc power supply applications can be described and solved via a second order differential equation. A simple closed-form solution can then be obtained.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1412", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1415", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497166", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1412 - 1415", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Chin Chang"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "resonant power convertors", "A-matrix", "DC-DC power supply", "circuit theory", "higher-order LC resonant converter", "second-order differential equation", "singularity", "Capacitors", "Circuit analysis", "Closed-form solution", "DC-DC power converters", "Differential equations", "Inductors", "Partial response channels", "RLC circuits", "Resonance", "Voltage", ""], "arnumber": "1145766"}
