In this correspondence, the FrFT is applied to airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) slow-moving target detection. For airborne SAR, the echo from a ground moving target can be regarded approximately as a chirp signal, and the FrFT is a way to concentrate the energy of a chirp signal. Therefore, the FrFT presents a potentially effective technique for ground moving target detection in airborne SAR. Compared with the common Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) algorithm, the FrFT is a linear operator, and will not be influenced by cross-terms even if multiple moving targets exist. Moreover, to solve the problem whereby weak targets are shadowed by the sidelobes of strong ones, a new implementation of the CLEAN technique is proposed based on filtering in the fractional Fourier domain. In this way strong moving targets and weak ones can be detected iteratively. This combined method is demonstrated by using raw clutter data combined with simulated moving targets.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1416", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1424", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497167", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1416 - 1424", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["Hong-Bo Sun", "Guo-Sui Liu", "Hong Gu", "Wei-Min Su"], "keywords": ["Fourier transforms", "airborne radar", "chirp modulation", "radar clutter", "radar detection", "radar signal processing", "synthetic aperture radar", "CLEAN technique", "Wigner-Ville distribution algorithm", "airborne synthetic aperture radar", "chirp signal", "fractional Fourier transform", "ground moving target detection", "radar clutter", "radar signal processing", "Airborne radar", "Chirp", "Clutter", "Filtering", "Fourier transforms", "Object detection", "Radar detection", "Radar signal processing", "Signal processing algorithms", "Synthetic aperture radar", ""], "arnumber": "1145767"}
