Such a requirement is practically impossible to fulfil for every resolution cell in a multiflying target multisensor environment. The true performance of the fusion center is often worse than expected due to fluctuations of the observed environment and instabilities of sensor thresholds. This work considers a nonparametric data fusion situation in which the fusion center knows only the number of the sensors, but ignores their error probabilities and cannot control their thresholds. A data adaptive approach to the problem is adopted, and combining P reports from Q independent distributed sensors through a least squares (LS) formulation to make a global decision is investigated. Such a fusion scheme does not entail strict stationarity of the noise environment nor strict invariance of the sensor error probabilities as is required in the NP formulation. The LS fusion scheme is analyzed in detail to simplify its form and determine its asymptotic behavior. Conditions of performance improvement as P increases and of quickness of such improvement are found. These conditions are usually valid in netted radar surveillance systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1158", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1171", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497142", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1158 - 1171", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["M.
