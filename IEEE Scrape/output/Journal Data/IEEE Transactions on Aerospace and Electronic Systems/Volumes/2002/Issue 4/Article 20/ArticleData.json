The evolution of the forward converter is discussed, leading naturally to the introduction of the double forward converter. Technical details for a series of radiation-hardened converters are then provided. This series was designed for space power management and distribution (PMAD) applications. The successful development of the PMAD converter demonstrated the viability of high voltage bus.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "firstpage": "1324", "volume": "38", "lastpage": "1334", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "sponsor": "Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society", "inspec": "7497155", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "1324 - 1334", "issn": "0018-9251"}, "authors": ["F.
