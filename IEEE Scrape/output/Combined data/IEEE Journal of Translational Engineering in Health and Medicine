The results of such analyses are, however, strongly related to content, and may be language- and culture-dependent. Little attention has been paid to a pure measure of the form of speech, unrelated to its content: inter-words time intervals. Method: 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy volunteers are recorded spontaneously speaking for 10-15 min. Recordings are analyzed for inter-words time intervals using the following nonlinear dynamical methods: unstable periodic orbits, correlation dimension, bi-spectral analysis, and symbolic dynamics. Results: The series of inter-word time intervals in normal speech have the characteristics of a low-dimensional chaotic attractor with a correlation dimension of 3.2 \u00b1 1.1. Deconstruction of the attractor appears in psychosis with re-establishment after anti-psychotic treatment. Shannon entropy, a measure of the complexity in the time series, calculated from symbolic dynamics, is higher for psychotic speech, which is also characterized by higher levels of phase coupling: higher bicoherence, obtained using bi-spectral analysis.

Therefore, they are not compatible with the crowded environment of the intensive care unit (ICU) or operating theatre, where patient co-operation is typically impossible. However, it is these patients that would benefit the most from accurate estimation of cardiopulmonary variables, because of their critical condition. This paper describes the results of a collaborative development between an anesthesiologists and biomedical engineers to create a compact and non-invasive system for the measurement of cardiopulmonary variables such as lung volume, airway dead space volume, and pulmonary blood flow. In contrast with conventional methods, the compact apparatus and non-invasive nature of the proposed method allow it to be used in the ICU, as well as in general clinical settings. We propose the use of a non-invasive method, in which tracer gases are injected into the patient's inspired breath, and the concentration of the tracer gases is subsequently measured. A novel breath-by-breath tidal ventilation model is then used to estimate the value of a patient's cardiopulmonary variables. Experimental results from an artificial lung demonstrate minimal error in the estimation of known parameters using the proposed method. Results from analysis of a cohort of 20 healthy volunteers (within the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust) show that the values of estimated cardiopulmonary variables from these subjects lies within the expected ranges. Advantages of this method are that it is non-invasive, compact, portable, and can perform analysis in real time with less than 1 min of acquired respiratory data.", "date_publication": "2013", "doi": "10.1109/JTEHM.2013.2268158", "issue_date": "2013", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "13631978", "firstpage": "1"}, "keywords": ["blood flow measurement", "cardiology", "lung", "pneumodynamics", "ventilation", "volume measurement", "ICU", "Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust", "airway dead space volume measurement", "anesthesiologists", "artificial lung", "biomedical engineers", "breath-by-breath injection", "cardiopulmonary variables", "gas analyzers", "intensive care unit", "lung volume measurement", "noninvasive method", "novel breath-by-breath tidal ventilation model", "operating theatre", "pulmonary blood flow measurement", "respiratory data", "tracer gases", "Cardiology", "Lungs", "Mathematical model", "Noninvasive treatment", "Temperature measurement", "Ventilation", "Volume measurement", "Non-invasive", "breath-by-breath", "cardiopulmonary variables", "model", "tidal ventilation", "tracer gas", ""], "authors": ["Lei Clifton", "David A.

Preclinical research involving laboratory animals is being conducted to study the principles, mechanisms, and therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation. A bottleneck is, however, the lack of deep brain stimulation devices that enable long term brain stimulation in freely moving laboratory animals. Most of the existing devices employ complex circuitry, and are thus bulky. These devices are usually connected to the electrode that is implanted into the animal brain using long fixed wires. In long term behavioral trials, however, laboratory animals often need to continuously receive brain stimulation for days without interruption, which is difficult with existing technology. This paper presents a low power and lightweight portable microdeep brain stimulation device for laboratory animals. Three different configurations of the device are presented as follows: 1) single piece head mountable; 2) single piece back mountable; and 3) two piece back mountable.

Accurate knowledge of cardiac quiescence is crucial to the performance of many imaging modalities, including computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). Synchronous electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography data were obtained from 10 healthy human subjects (four male, six female, 23-45 years) and the interventricular septum (IVS) was observed using the apical four-chamber echocardiographic view. The velocity of the IVS was derived from active contour tracking and verified using tissue Doppler imaging echocardiography methods. In turn, the frame-to-frame deviation methods for identifying quiescence of the IVS were verified using active contour tracking. The timing of the diastolic quiescent phase was found to exhibit both inter- and intra-subject variability, suggesting that the current method of CTCA gating based on the ECG is suboptimal and that gating based on signals derived from cardiac motion are likely more accurate in predicting quiescence for cardiac imaging. Two robust and efficient methods for identifying cardiac quiescent phases from B-mode echocardiographic data were developed and verified.

Eighteen post-stroke patients were enrolled in a six-week therapy program and divided into two groups. They were all required to perform horizontal pointing movements both in the presence of a robot-generated divergent force field (DF) that pushed their hands proportional to the trajectory error and perpendicular to the direction of motion, and according to the typical active assistive (AA) approach used in robotic therapy. We used a crossover experimental paradigm where the two groups switched from one therapy treatment to the other. The hypothesis underlying this paper was that the use of the destabilizing scenario forced the patient to keep the end-point position as close as possible to the ideal path, hence requiring a more active control of the arm with respect to the AA approach. Our findings confirmed this hypothesis. In addition, when the DF treatment was provided in the first therapy cycle, patients also showed straighter and smoother paths during the subsequent AA therapy cycle, while this was not true in the opposite case. In conclusion, the results herein reported provide evidence that the use of an unstable DF field can lead to better recovery outcomes, and therefore it potentially more effective than solely active assistance therapy alone.", "date_publication": "Wed Jul 24 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "doi": "10.1109/JTEHM.2013.2271898", "issue_date": "2013", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "13689003", "firstpage": "2100109"}, "keywords": ["biomechanics", "medical robotics", "patient rehabilitation", "patient treatment", "active arm control", "active assistive approach", "active assistive robot-mediated treatment", "chronic post stroke patients", "error-enhancing robot-mediated treatment", "horizontal pointing movements", "robot-generated divergent force field", "robotic therapy", "robotic-aided rehabilitation treatment", "six-week therapy program", "therapy treatment", "time 6 week", "trajectory error", "upper limb related capability recovery", "Analysis of variance", "Kinematics", "Medical robots", "Medical treatment", "Rehabilitation robotics", "Strokes", "Trajectory", "Rehabilitation robotics", "assisted-as-needed", "error-enhancing", "stroke", "upper arm", ""], "authors": ["Peppino Tropea", "Benedetta Cesqui", "Vito Monaco", "Sara Aliboni", "Federico Posteraro", "Silvestro Micera"], "citations": ["7281193", "6944823"], "arnumber": "6567887"}, "Article 3": {"references": ["482566", "1019511", "4580816"], "details": {"sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "title": "Novel Tool for Complete Digitization of Paper Electrocardiography Data", "volume": "1", "date": "2013", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "lastpage": "1800107", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 13 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issn": "2168-2372", "abstract": "Objective: We present a Matlab-based tool to convert electrocardiography (ECG) information from paper charts into digital ECG signals. The tool can be used for long-term retrospective studies of cardiac patients to study the evolving features with prognostic value. Methods and procedures: To perform the conversion, we: 1) detect the graphical grid on ECG charts using grayscale thresholding; 2) digitize the ECG signal based on its contour using a column-wise pixel scan; and 3) use template-based optical character recognition to extract patient demographic information from the paper ECG in order to interface the data with the patients' medical record. To validate the digitization technique: 1) correlation between the digital signals and signals digitized from paper ECG are performed and 2) clinically significant ECG parameters are measured and compared from both the paper-based ECG signals and the digitized ECG. Results: The validation demonstrates a correlation value of 0.85-0.9 between the digital ECG signal and the signal digitized from the paper ECG. There is a high correlation in the clinical parameters between the ECG information from the paper charts and digitized signal, with intra-observer and inter-observer correlations of 0.8-0.9 (p <; 0.05), and kappa statistics ranging from 0.85 (inter-observer) to 1.00 (intra-observer). Conclusion: The important features of the ECG signal, especially the QRST complex and the associated intervals, are preserved by obtaining the contour from the paper ECG. The differences between the measures of clinically important features extracted from the original signal and the reconstructed signal are insignificant, thus highlighting the accuracy of this technique. Clinical impact: Using this type of ECG digitization tool to carry out retrospective studies on large databases, which rely on paper ECG records, studies of emerging ECG features can be performed.

Current methods for monitoring waterborne pathogens are often time consuming, expensive, and labor intensive, making them not suitable for these regions. Electrochemical detection in a microfluidic platform offers many advantages such as portability, minimal use of instrumentation, and easy integration with electronics. In many parts of the world, however, the required equipment for pathogen detection through electrochemical sensors is either not available or insufficiently portable, and operators may not be trained to use these sensors and interpret results, ultimately preventing its wide adoption. Counterintuitively, these same regions often have an extensive mobile phone infrastructure, suggesting the possibility of integrating electrochemical detection of bacterial pathogens with a mobile platform. Toward a solution to water quality interventions, we demonstrate a microfluidic electrochemical sensor combined with a mobile interface that detects the sequences from bacterial pathogens, suitable for rapid, affordable, and point-of-care water monitoring. We employ the transduction of DNA hybridization into a readily detectable electric signal by means of a conformational change of DNA stem-loop structure.

This is mainly because of the failure of early detection and effective treatment. We designed a novel 3-D GBM cell culture model based on microwells that could mimic in vitro environment and help to bypass the lack of suitable animal models for preclinical toxicity tests. Microwells were fabricated from simple and inexpensive polyethylene glycol material for the control of in vitro 3-D culture.

Our preliminary results suggested that uniform GBM spheroids can be formed in 3-D, and the size of these GBM spheroids depends on the size of microwells. The viability of the spheroids generated in this manner was quantitatively evaluated using live/dead assay and shown to improve over 21 days.

Statistical evidence has revealed that the majority of deaths resulting from skin cancer are as a result of melanoma.

Clinical diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma are challenging, since the processes are prone to misdiagnosis and inaccuracies due to doctors' subjectivity. Malignant melanomas are asymmetrical, have irregular borders, notched edges, and color variations, so analyzing the shape, color, and texture of the skin lesion is important for the early detection and prevention of melanoma. This paper proposes the two major components of a noninvasive real-time automated skin lesion analysis system for the early detection and prevention of melanoma. The first component is a real-time alert to help users prevent skinburn caused by sunlight; a novel equation to compute the time for skin to burn is thereby introduced. The second component is an automated image analysis module, which contains image acquisition, hair detection and exclusion, lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The proposed system uses PH2 Dermoscopy image database from Pedro Hispano Hospital for the development and testing purposes. The image database contains a total of 200 dermoscopy images of lesions, including benign, atypical, and melanoma cases.

Surface ECG (Electrocardiogram)-based diagnosis of CAN is useful to overcome the limitation of existing cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests traditionally used for CAN identification in clinical settings. The aim of this paper is to analyze the changes in the mechanical function of the ventricles in terms of systolic-diastolic interval interaction (SDI) from a surface ECG to assess the severity of CAN progression [no CAN, early CAN (ECAN) or subclinical CAN, and definite CAN (DCAN) or clinical CAN]. ECG signals recorded in supine resting condition from 72 diabetic subjects without CAN (CAN-) and 70 diabetic subjects with CAN were analyzed in this paper. The severity of CAN was determined by Ewing's Cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests. Fifty-five subjects of the CAN group had ECAN and 15 subjects had DCAN. In this paper, we propose an improved version of the SDI parameter (i.e., TQ/RR interval ratio) measured from the electrical diastolic interval (i.e., TQ interval) and the heart rate interval (i.e., RR interval). The performance of the proposed SDI measure was compared with the performance of the existing SDI measure (i.e., QT/TQ interval ratio). The proposed SDI parameter showed significant differences among three groups (no CAN, ECAN, and DCAN). In addition, the proposed SDI parameter was found to be more sensitive in detecting CAN progression than other ECG interval-based features traditionally used for CAN diagnosis. The modified SDI parameter might be used as an alternative measure for the Ewing autonomic reflex tests to identify CAN progression for those subjects who are unable to perform the traditional tests.

Pervasive healthcare systems apply information and communication technology to enable the usage of ubiquitous clinical data by authorized medical persons.

A technological context is characterized by potential technological disruptions that affect optimal functioning of technological resources. The clinical data based on input from these technological resources can therefore have quality degradations. If these degradations are not noticed, the use of this clinical data can lead to wrong treatment decisions, which potentially puts the patient's safety at risk. This paper presents an ontology that specifies the relation among technological context, quality of clinical data, and patient treatment. The presented ontology provides a formal way to represent the knowledge to specify the effect of technological context variations in the clinical data quality and the impact of the clinical data quality on a patient's treatment.

In addition, catheter-based intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography imaging of coronary arteries provides important information about the coronary lumen, wall, and plaque characteristics. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of these cross-sectional image data will be beneficial to the evaluation and the treatment of coronary artery diseases such as atherosclerosis. In all the phases (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative) during the transcatheter intervention procedure, computer vision techniques (e.g., image segmentation and motion tracking) have been largely applied in the field to accomplish tasks like annulus measurement, valve selection, catheter placement control, and vessel centerline extraction. This provides beneficial guidance for the clinicians in surgical planning, disease diagnosis, and treatment assessment.

To this purpose, global PDMs are extracted from 1-min EEG signals of 17 AD patients and 24 control subjects at rest using Volterra models estimated via Laguerre expansions, whereby the O1 or O2 recording is viewed as the input signal and the F3 or F4 recording as the output signal. Subsequent singular value decomposition of the estimated Volterra kernels yields the global PDMs that represent an efficient basis of functions for the representation of the EEG dynamics in all subjects. The respective ANFs are computed for each subject and characterize the specific dynamics of each subject.

Methods: Functional integration of new robotic technology for research in the ED presented several obstacles that required a multidisciplinary approach, including participation from electrical and computer engineers, emergency medicine clinicians, and clinical operations staff of the hospital. Our team addressed many challenges in deployment of this advanced technology including: 1) adapting the investigational device for the unique clinical environment; 2) acquisition and maintenance of appropriate testing space for point-of-care assessment; and 3) dedicated technical support and upkeep of the device. Upon successful placement of the robotic device in the ED, the clinical study required screening of all patients presenting to the ED with complaints of head injury. Eligible patients were enrolled and tested using a robot-assisted test battery. Three weeks after the injury, patients were contacted to complete follow-up assessments. Results: Adapting the existing technology to meet anticipated physical constraints of the ED was performed by engineering a mobile platform. Due to the large footprint of the device, it was frequently moved before ultimately being fully integrated into the ED. Over 14 months, 1423 patients were screened. Twenty-eight patients could not be enrolled because the device was unavailable due to operations limitations. Technical problems with the device resulted in failure to include 20 patients. A total of 66 mTBI patients were enrolled and 42 of them completed both robot-assisted testing and follow-up assessment. Successful completion of screening and enrollment demonstrated that the challenges associated with integration of investigational devices into the ED can be effectively addressed through a collaborative pat- ent-oriented research model. Conclusion: Effective deployment and use of new robotic technology for research in an urban academic ED required significant planning, coordination, and collaboration with key personnel from multiple disciplines.

Aspiration due to dysphagia is a major health risk that could cause pneumonia and even death. The videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS), which is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of dysphagia, is not widely available, expensive and causes exposure to radiation. The screening tests used for dysphagia need to be carried out by trained staff, and the evaluations are usually non-quantifiable. This paper investigates the development of the Swallowscope, a smartphone-based device and a feasible real-time swallowing sound-processing algorithm for the automatic screening, quantitative evaluation, and the visualisation of swallowing ability. The device can be used during activities of daily life with minimal intervention, making it potentially more capable of capturing aspirations and risky swallow patterns through the continuous monitoring. It also consists of a cloud-based system for the server-side analyzing and automatic sharing of the swallowing sound. The real-time algorithm we developed for the detection of dry and water swallows is based on a template matching approach. We analyzed the wavelet transformation-based spectral characteristics and the temporal characteristics of simultaneous synchronised VFSS and swallowing sound recordings of 25% barium mixed 3-ml water swallows of 70 subjects and the dry or saliva swallowing sound of 15 healthy subjects to establish the parameters of the template. With this algorithm, we achieved an overall detection accuracy of 79.3% (standard error: 4.2%) for the 92 water swallows; and a precision of 83.7% (range: 66.6%-100%) and a recall of 93.9% (range: 72.7%-100%) for the 71 episodes of dry swallows.", "date_publication": "Fri Nov 13 00:00:00 EST 2015", "doi": "10.1109/JTEHM.2015.2500562", "issue_date": "2015", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "15623153", "firstpage": "1"}, "keywords": ["biomedical equipment", "biomedical optical imaging", "medical disorders", "medical image processing", "smart phones", "automatic sharing", "cloud-based system", "continuous monitoring", "dry swallowing", "dry swallows", "dysphagia diagnosis", "gold standard", "health risk", "mental health", "overall detection accuracy", "pneumonia", "real-time algorithm", "risky swallow patterns", "saliva swallowing sound", "screening testing", "server-side analyzing", "simultaneous synchronised VFSS", "smartphone-based device", "smartphone-based real-time assessment", "swallowing ability", "swallowing sound recordings", "transformation-based spectral characteristics", "videofluoroscopic swallow study", "water swallows", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Diseases", "Hospitals", "Liquids", "Medical diagnostic imaging", "Monitoring", "Bedside monitoring", "Cervical auscultation", "Dysphagia", "Realtime monitoring", "Screening", "Swallowing sound", "Videofluoroscopy", "bedside monitoring", "cervical auscultation", "mHealth", "realtime monitoring", "screening", "videofluoroscopy", ""], "authors": ["Dushyantha Jayatilake", "Tomoyuki Ueno", "Yohei Teramoto", "Kei Nakai", "Kikue Hidaka", "Satoshi Ayuzawa", "Kiyoshi Eguchi", "Akira Matsumura", "Kenji Suzuki"], "citations": [], "arnumber": "7328724"}, "Article 2": {"references": ["4770110", "6656866", "5415599", "5597935", "4359993", "1634345", "5272431", "4457504", "6777305", "6755923"], "details": {"sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "title": "An Optokinetic Nystagmus Detection Method for Use With Young Children", "volume": "3", "date": "2015", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "lastpage": "10", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 24 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issn": "2168-2372", "abstract": "The detection of vision problems in early childhood can prevent neurodevelopmental disorders such as amblyopia.

Hence, there is a need to find ways to address the presence of unwanted conduction gaps at the time of lesion creation. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to examine conduction gaps, by using a proof of concept device to examine local electrical activation within the cardiac areas of an applied lesion, i.e., to locate gaps in the lesion set. To accomplish this, both epicardial and endocardial linear ablation lines composed of spot lesions with conduction gaps were created in a porcine model. The forces necessary to elicit monophasic action potentials (MAP) were collected from >200 measurements on the epicardium of the right ventricle. Ablations were then performed on the ventricular epicardium and left atrial mitral isthmus endocardially, while recording MAPs. We were able to successfully demonstrate the use of a proof of concept device to identify conduction gaps in linear lesion sets; furthermore, we were able to determine required contact forces to appropriately determine focal electrical changes of the underlying tissues.

Fluoride is toxic to humans in high concentrations, such as can occur in persons working in fluoride-containing mineral industries like aluminum industries. When workers are exposed to fluoride-containing minerals, they can suffer from a variety of health problems, such as dental disease. This paper presents the relationship of different clinical conditions correlated against the fluoride level. Contributing clinical aspects, such as morbidity, dysentery, overcrowding, and skin disease, are also studied to assess the consequences of fluoride upon consistent exposure. The relationship between pH and hardness of water with fluoride was measured, and then spatial maps were generated. The investigations resulted in a conclusion that hardness of water had a more pronounced impact on the level of fluoride concentration as compared with pH. Water with more hardness contains more fluoride concentration (25 mg/ml) as compared with soft water (4 mg/ml). This paper also revealed the concentration of fluoride content in the bodies of aluminum plant workers, which varied from 0.06 to 0.17 mg/L of blood serum in the case of pot room workers and 0.01 to 0.04 mg/L in the case of non-pot room workers. In fingernails, it varied from 0.09 to 3.77 mg/L and 0.39 to 1.15 mg/L in the case of pot room and non-pot room workers, respectively. In urine, it varied from 0.53 to 9.50 mg/L in pot room workers and 0.29 to 1.80 mg/L in non-pot room workers.

There have been reports about the difference between the left and the right sides of the CCA IMT and their relation with CVD. In this paper, we propose an automated system based on image normalization, speckle reduction filtering, and snakes segmentation, for segmenting the CCA, perform IMT measurements, and provide the differences between the left and the right sides. The study was performed on 1104 longitudinal-section ultrasound images acquired from 568 men and 536 women out of which 125 had cardiovascular symptoms (CVD). A cardiovascular expert manually delineated the IMT for the normal and the CVD groups. The corresponding (normal versus CVD) IMT mean \u00b1 standard deviation values for the left and the right sides were 0.74 \u00b1 0.24 versus 0.87 \u00b1 0.24 mm and 0.70 \u00b1 0.17 versus 0.80 \u00b1 0.18 mm, respectively. The main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) there was no significant difference between the CCA left side IMT and the right side IMT. These findings suggest that the measurement of the CCA IMT on one side only is needed for the normal group (and this is in agreement with other studies); 2) there were statistical significant differences for the IMT measurements between the normal group and the CVD group for both the left and the right sides; 3) there was an increasing linear relationship of the left and the right IMT measurements with age for the normal group; and to a lesser extend for the CVD group; 4) no statistical significant differences were found between the manual and the automated IMT measurements for both sides; and 5) the best result for classification disease modeling, using support vector machines, to discriminate between the normal and the CVD groups was a 64%\u00b13.5% correct classifications score when using both the left and the right IMT automated measurements. F- rther research is required for estimating differences and similarities between left and right intima media complex structure and morphology and their variability with texture features for differentiating between the normal and the CVD group.", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "doi": "10.1109/JTEHM.2015.2450735", "issue_date": "2015", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "15314153", "firstpage": "1"}, "keywords": ["biomedical ultrasonics", "blood vessels", "cardiovascular system", "diseases", "feature extraction", "image classification", "image filtering", "image segmentation", "image texture", "medical image processing", "speckle", "support vector machines", "thickness measurement", "ultrasonic measurement", "IMT measurements", "automated system", "cardiovascular disease", "cardiovascular symptoms", "classification disease modeling", "image normalization", "left common carotid artery", "longitudinal-section ultrasound images", "morphology", "right common carotid artery", "snakes segmentation", "speckle reduction filtering", "support vector machines", "texture features", "ultrasound intima-media thickness measurements", "Arteries", "Cardiovascular diseases", "Image segmentation", "Manuals", "Ultrasonic imaging", "Ultrasonic variables measurement", "B-mode", "Common carotid artery", "IMT", "Ultrasound imaging", "cardiovascular disease", "common carotid artery", "intima media thickness", "ultrasound imaging", ""], "authors": ["Christos P.

Unfortunately, PW incidents and accidents are not uncommon and their consequences can be serious. The objective of this paper is to develop technological tools that can be used to characterize a wheelchair user's driving behavior under various settings. In the experiments conducted, PWs are outfitted with a datalogging platform that records, in real-time, the 3-D acceleration of the PW. Data collection was conducted over 35 different activities, designed to capture a spectrum of PW driving events performed at different speeds (collisions with fixed or moving objects, rolling on incline plane, and rolling across multiple types obstacles). The data was processed using time-series analysis and data mining techniques, to automatically detect and identify the different events. We compared the classification accuracy using four different types of time-series features: 1) time-delay embeddings; 2) time-domain characterization; 3) frequency-domain features; and 4) wavelet transforms. In the analysis, we compared the classification accuracy obtained when distinguishing between safe and unsafe events during each of the 35 different activities. For the purposes of this study, unsafe events were defined as activities containing collisions against objects at different speed, and the remainder were defined as safe events. We were able to accurately detect 98% of unsafe events, with a low (12%) false positive rate, using only five examples of each activity.

Written self-report anxiety measures are available; however, these indices tend to be time consuming to acquire. For medical patients, completing written reports can be burdensome if they are weak, in pain, or in acute anxiety states. Consequently, simple and fast non-invasive methods for assessing stress response from neurophysiological data are essential. In this paper, we report on a study that makes predictions of the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) index from oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentration changes of the prefrontal cortex using a two-channel portable near-infrared spectroscopy device. Predictions are achieved by constructing machine learning algorithms within a Bayesian framework with nonlinear basis function together with Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation. In this paper, prediction experiments were performed against four different data sets, i.e., two comprising young subjects, and the remaining two comprising elderly subjects. The number of subjects in each data set varied between 17 and 20 and each subject participated only once. They were not asked to perform any task; instead, they were at rest. The root mean square errors for the four groups were 6.20, 6.62, 4.50, and 6.38, respectively. There appeared to be no significant distinctions of prediction accuracies between age groups and since the STAI are defined between 20 and 80, the predictions appeared reasonably accurate.

The aim of this paper was to develop a system to investigate the relationship between voiding dysfunction and alteration of the shape of the prostatic urethra by processing endoscopic video images of the urethra and analyzing the fluid dynamics of the urine stream. A panoramic image of the prostatic urethra was generated from cystourethroscopic video images. A virtual 3-D model of the urethra was constructed using the luminance values in the image. Fluid dynamics using the constructed model was then calculated assuming a static urethra and maximum urine flow rate. Cystourethroscopic videos from 11 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were recorded around administration of an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist. The calculated pressure loss through the prostatic urethra in each model corresponded to the prostatic volume, and the improvements of the pressure loss after treatment correlated to the conventional clinical indices. As shown by the proposed method, the shape of the prostatic urethra affects the transporting urine fluid energy, and this paper implies a possible method for detecting critical lesions responsible for voiding dysfunction.

However, these images are no longer accurate once the skull has been opened and brain shift occurs. To account for changes in the shape of the brain caused by mechanical (e.g., gravity-induced deformations) and physiological effects (e.g., hyperosmotic drug-induced shrinking, or edema-induced swelling), updated images of the brain must be provided to the neuronavigation system in a timely manner for practical use in the operating room. In this paper, a novel preoperative and intraoperative computational processing pipeline for near real-time brain shift correction in the operating room was developed to automate and simplify the processing steps. Preoperatively, a computer model of the patient's brain with a subsequent atlas of potential deformations due to surgery is generated from diagnostic image volumes. In the case of interim gross changes between diagnosis, and surgery when reimaging is necessary, our preoperative pipeline can be generated within one day of surgery. Intraoperatively, sparse data measuring the cortical brain surface is collected using an optically tracked portable laser range scanner. These data are then used to guide an inverse modeling framework whereby full volumetric brain deformations are reconstructed from precomputed atlas solutions to rapidly match intraoperative cortical surface shift measurements. Once complete, the volumetric displacement field is used to update, i.e., deform, preoperative brain images to their intraoperative shifted state. In this paper, five surgical cases were analyzed with respect to the computational pipeline and workflow timing. With respect to postcortical surface data acquisition, the approximate execution time was 4.5 min. The total update process which included positioning the scanner, data acquisition, inverse model processing, and image deforming was ~ 11-13 min.

With lower light intensity, the light spectra >600 nm still showed better performance. The change in pulse amplitude (ac) and dc amplitude was also investigated with the different light intensity and light spectra. With increasing light intensity, the dc amplitude increased, whereas ac component showed an initial increase followed by a decrease. Most of the subjects achieved their maximum averaging ac output when averaging dc output was in the range from 180 to 220 pixel values (8 b, 255 maximum pixel value).

There is a clinical need for a system that can accurately monitor inhaler adherence as currently no method exists to evaluate how patients use their inhalers between clinic visits. This paper presents a method of automatically evaluating inhaler adherence through acoustic analysis of inhaler sounds. An acoustic monitoring device was employed to record the sounds patients produce while using a Diskus dry powder inhaler, in addition to the time and date patients use the inhaler. An algorithm was designed and developed to automatically detect inhaler events from the audio signals and provide feedback regarding patient adherence. The algorithm was evaluated on 407 audio files obtained from 12 community dwelling asthmatic patients. Results of the automatic classification were compared against two expert human raters. For patient data for whom the human raters Cohen's kappa agreement score was , results indicated that the algorithm's accuracy was 83% in determining the correct inhaler technique score compared with the raters.

The benefit of TABWS in functional recovery of walking in spinal cord injury and stroke patients has been demonstrated and reported. However, shortage of therapists, labor-intensiveness, and short duration of training are some limitations of this approach. To overcome these deficiencies, robotic-assisted gait rehabilitation systems have been suggested. These systems have gained attentions from researchers and clinical practitioner in recent years. To achieve the same objective, an over-ground gait rehabilitation system, NaTUre-gaits, was developed at the Nanyang Technological University. The design was based on a clinical approach to provide four main features, which are pelvic motion, body weight support, over-ground walking experience, and lower limb assistance. These features can be achieved by three main modules of NaTUre-gaits: 1) pelvic assistance mechanism, mobile platform, and robotic orthosis. Predefined gait patterns are required for a robotic assisted system to follow. In this paper, the gait pattern planning for NaTUre-gaits was accomplished by an individual-specific gait pattern prediction model. The model generates gait patterns that resemble natural gait patterns of the targeted subjects. The features of NaTUre-gaits have been demonstrated by walking trials with several subjects.

Gastrointestinal diseases are mainly based on morphological abnormalities. However, gastrointestinal symptoms are sometimes apparent without visible abnormalities. One of the major factors for these diseases is abnormal gastrointestinal motility. For assessment of gastric motility, a gastric motility imaging system is needed. To assess the dynamic motility of the stomach, the proposed system measures 3-D gastric contractions derived from a 3-D profile of the stomach wall obtained with a developed 3-D endoscope. After obtaining contraction waves, their frequency, amplitude, and speed of propagation can be calculated using a Gaussian function. The proposed system was evaluated for 3-D measurements of several objects with known geometries. The results showed that the surface profiles could be obtained with an error of <;10% of the distance between two different points on images. Subsequently, we evaluated the validity of a prototype system using a wave simulated model. In the experiment, the amplitude and position of waves could be measured with 1-mm accuracy. The present results suggest that the proposed system can measure the speed and amplitude of contractions.

This paper presents an evaluation in the of use of microwave Doppler radar for capturing different dynamics of breathing patterns in addition to the respiration rate. Although finding the respiration rate is essential, identifying abnormal breathing patterns in real-time could be used to gain further insights into respiratory disorders and refine diagnostic procedures. Several known breathing disorders were professionally role played and captured in a real-time laboratory environment using a noncontact Doppler radar to evaluate the feasibility of this noncontact form of measurement in capturing breathing patterns under different conditions associated with certain breathing disorders. In addition to that, inhalation and exhalation flow patterns under different breathing scenarios were investigated to further support the feasibility of Doppler radar to accurately estimate the tidal volume. The results obtained for both experiments were compared with the gold standard measurement schemes, such as respiration belt and spirometry readings, yielding significant correlations with the Doppler radar-based information.

In this paper, we present a novel device with remote monitoring capabilities expressly conceived for the needs of rheumatic patients.

Their evaluation has been performed not only with traditional methods, but also with the proposed device. Subjective (hand algofunctional Dreiser's index) and objective (ROM, strength, and dexterity) parameters showed a sustained improvement throughout the follow-up.

The complex permittivity measurements were performed on cells suspended in culture medium using an open-ended coaxial probe. Maxwell's mixture equation then allows the calculation of the permittivity profiles of the cells from the difference in permittivity between the cell suspensions and pure culture medium. The open-ended coaxial probe turned out to be very sensitive to disturbances affecting the measurements, resulting in poor precision. Permittivity differences were not large in relation to the spread of the measurements and repeated measurements were performed to improve statistics. The 95% confidence intervals were computed for the arithmetic means of the measured permittivity differences in order to test the statistical significance. The results showed that for bone cells at the lowest tested concentration (33 500/ml), there were significance in the real part of the permittivity at frequencies above 30 GHz, and no significance in the imaginary part. For the second lowest concentration (67 000/ml) there was no significance at all. For a medium concentration of bone cells (135 000/ml) there was no significance in the real part, but there was significance in the imaginary part at frequencies below about 25 GHz. The cell suspension with a concentration of 1 350 000/ml had significance in the real part for both high (above 30 GHz) and low (below 15 GHz) frequencies. The imaginary part showed significance for frequencies below 25 GHz. In the case of an osteosarcoma cell line with a concentration of 2 700 000/ml, only the imaginary part showed significance, and only for frequencies below 15 GHz. For muscle cells at a concentration of 743 450/ml, there was only significance in the imaginary part for frequencies below 5 GHz.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce an impedance-based control strategy (consisting of four novel algorithms) for an active knee and ankle prosthesis and test its generalizability across multiple walking speeds, walking surfaces, and users. The four algorithms increased ankle stiffness throughout stance, decreased knee stiffness during terminal stance, as well as provided powered ankle plantarflexion and knee swing initiation through modifications of equilibrium positions of the ankle and knee, respectively. Seven amputees (knee disarticulation and transfemoral levels) walked at slow, comfortable, and hurried speeds on level and inclined (10\u00b0) surfaces. The prosthesis was tuned at their comfortable level ground walking speed. We further quantified trends in prosthetic knee and ankle kinematics, and kinetics across conditions. Subjects modulated their walking speed by \u00b125% (average) from their comfortable speeds. As speed increased, increasing ankle angles and velocities as well as stance phase ankle power and plantarflexion torque were observed. At slow and comfortable speeds, plantarflexion torque was increased on the incline. At slow and comfortable speeds, stance phase positive knee power was increased and knee torque more flexor on the incline. As speed increased, knee torque became less flexor on the incline. These algorithms were shown to generalize well across speed, produce gait mechanics that compare favorably with non-amputee data, and display evidence of scalable device function.

This paper presents an innovative 3-D fully automatic method to be used on top of the multiatlas concept for the HC segmentation. The method is based on a subject-specific set of 3-D optimal local maps (OLMs) that locally control the influence of each energy term of a hybrid active contour model (ACM). The complete set of the OLMs for a set of training images is defined simultaneously via an optimization scheme. At the same time, the optimal ACM parameters are also calculated. Therefore, heuristic parameter fine-tuning is not required. Training OLMs are subsequently combined, by applying an extended multiatlas concept, to produce the OLMs that are anatomically more suitable to the test image. The proposed algorithm was tested on three different and publicly available data sets.

Visual features ranging from simple intensity or oriented edges to more complex information identified automatically about objects in the environment may be translated in this manner into haptic stimulation of the finger.

However, the literature reports statistically significant differences between 1-D MRS measurements from control groups and subjects with disease states but frequently provides little information on the algorithms and parameters used to process the data. The sensitivity of in vivo brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy biomarkers is investigated with respect to parameter values for two key stages of post-acquisitional processing. Our effort is specifically motivated by the lack of consensus on approaches and parameter values for the two critical operations, water resonance removal, and baseline correction. The different stages of data processing also introduce varying levels of uncertainty and arbitrary selection of parameter values can significantly underutilize the intrinsic differences between two classes of signals. The sensitivity of biomarkers points to the need for a better understanding of how all stages of post-acquisitional processing affect biomarker discovery and ultimately, clinical translation. Our results also highlight the possibility of optimizing biomarker discovery by the careful selection of parameters that best reveal class differences. Using previously reported data and biomarkers, our results demonstrate that small changes in parameter values affect the statistical significance and corresponding effect size of biomarkers. Consequently, it is possible to increase the strength of biomarkers by selecting optimal parameter values in different spectral intervals. Our analyses with a previously reported data set demonstrate an increase in effect sizes for wavelet-based biomarkers of up to 36%, with increases in classification performance of up to 12%.", "date_publication": "2014", "doi": "10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2309333", "issue_date": "2014", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "14178631", "firstpage": "1"}, "keywords": ["biomedical MRI", "brain", "diseases", "image classification", "magnetic resonance spectroscopy", "medical image processing", "statistical analysis", "1-D MRS measurements", "baseline correction", "biomarker sensitivity measurement", "clinical translation", "data processing", "disease states", "in vivo brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy biomarkers", "post-acquisitional processing", "post-processing algorithms", "statistical significance", "water resonance removal", "wavelet-based biomarkers", "Biomarkers", "Classification algorithms", "Clinical diagnosis", "In vivo", "Magnetic resonance", "Pain management", "Spectroscopy", "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy", "biomarkers", "neuroimaging", "sensitivity", "statistical significance", ""], "authors": ["Daniel Cocuzzo", "Alexander Lin", "Peter Stanwell", "Carolyn Mountford", "Nirmal Keshava"], "citations": [], "arnumber": "6754141"}, "Article 1": {"references": [], "details": {"sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "title": "Some Consequences of Refusing to Participate in Peer Review", "volume": "2", "date": "2014", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "lastpage": "3", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 28 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issn": "2168-2372", "abstract": "The proliferation of journals has had an unexpected side effect: it is now difficult to find qualified reviewers willing to devote the time necessary for assessing journal contributions.
