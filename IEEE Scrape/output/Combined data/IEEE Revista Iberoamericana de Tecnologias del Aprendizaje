The aim of the videogame is to motivate young people to go to classical theater plays and to familiarize students with the plot and the characters before they go to the theater. This goal is achieved by making avatars interesting to players, by incorporating different theater techniques to generate characters' personalities and by including the elements that can be used as audiovisual content such as music, scenery, and costume design. In this paper, we also present the results of an initial evaluation of the game with master's students from the E-learning group. In order to improve the game, we have studied its effects in terms of improvement of knowledge, learning outcomes, and student motivation.", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 17 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "doi": "10.1109/RITA.2013.2285023", "issue_date": "Nov. 2013", "issue": "4", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "13934245", "firstpage": "197"}, "keywords": ["avatars", "computer aided instruction", "humanities", "serious games (computing)", "La Dama Boba", "audiovisual content", "avatars", "character personality", "classical drama", "classical theater plays", "costume design", "e-learning group", "educational games", "master students", "serious game", "student motivation", "theater techniques", "videogame", "young people", "Avatars", "Educational institutions", "Electronic learning", "Games", "Serious games", "Spain", "Educational technology", "computer aided instruction", "computer games for drama learning", "drama", "game-based learning", "serious games", "virtual learning environments", ""], "authors": ["Borja Manero Iglesias", "Clara Fern\u00e1ndez-Vara", "Baltasar Fern\u00e1ndez-Manj\u00f3n"], "citations": [], "arnumber": "6636074"}, "Article 2": {"references": [], "details": {"sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "title": "Innovative Approaches to Serious Games", "volume": "8", "date": "Nov. 2013", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "lastpage": "165", "pages": "163 - 165", "date_current_version": "Tue Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issn": "1932-8540", "abstract": "The field of serious games (SGs) focuses on the design, development, application, and use of games for other purposes beyond entertainment.

However, despite the evidence of their effectiveness, displayed also in this IEEE RITA issue, there is still limited use of SG. There could be many reasons behind this (e.g., cost), but we think it has mainly to do with social issues and preconceptions about using games for serious purposes.

Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy oriented to the elimination of activities that do not create any type of value and are thus considered a waste. One of the main differences from other management philosophies is the shop-floor focus and the operators' involvement. Therefore, the training of all organization levels is crucial for the success of lean manufacturing. Universities should also participate actively in this process by developing students' lean management skills and promoting a better and faster integration of students into their future organizations. This paper proposes a single realistic manufacturing platform, involving production and assembly operations, to learn by playing many of the lean tools such as VSM, 5S, SMED, poke-yoke, line balance, TPM, Mizusumashi, plant layout, and JIT/kanban. This simulation game was built in tight cooperation with experienced lean companies under the international program \u201cLean Learning Academy,\u201dhttp://www.leanlearningacademy.eu/ and its main aim is to make bachelor and master courses in applied sciences more attractive by integrating classic lectures with a simulated production environment that could result in more motivated students and higher study yields.

This robot competition can play an important role in education due to its inherent multidisciplinary approach, which can motivate students to bridge different technological areas. It can also play an important role in research and development, because it is expected that its outcomes will later be transferred to real-world problems in manufacturing or service robots. By presenting a scaled-down factory shop floor, this competition creates a benchmark that can be used to compare different approaches to the challenges that arise in this kind of environment. The ability to alter the environment, in some restricted areas, can usually promote the test and evaluation of different localization mechanisms, which is not possible in other competitions.

Many of these studies have focused on specific sets of skills that specific video games can promote. Nevertheless, there is evidence that any type of video game, regardless of its learning or recreational nature, can help students develop certain knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) that could be useful for engineering courses and projects. This evidence also suggests that digital game-based learning contributes to 21st-century skills that are necessary for competitive engineering professionals. This literature review will describe the KSAs that could be promoted in constructivist-oriented classrooms when learners engage in any type of video game.

The sector of the population looking for instruction on these subjects has increased and diversified. We need new tools that appeal to this wider audience, and game-based learning is one of the most promising approaches at the moment. There is a need for more scalable game-based instruction paradigms that can be easily adapted to different levels of complexity and content related to CS (different programming languages, different programming paradigms, and so on). Throughout this paper, we present a flexible and scalable architecture to create videogames for learning CS languages. The architecture is based on the idea that students control the game using small pieces of text written in some CS language. The keys of the scalability of our approach are: 1) it separates the CS language used to write the programs from the game design and 2) the game model provides a system of levels that allows incremental learning of CS language structures. As validation and implementation of our approach, we developed Lost in Space, an educational videogame to teach the XML markup language. In this game, the player travels through several levels, guiding a spaceship by introducing small pieces of XML in a text console. Players can move and rotate the ship among other power-ups that get unblocked as they advances in the game. The game was tested with undergraduate students from CS and social sciences, by comparing it with traditional instruction (i.e., a teacher with a slides presentation). Students who played the game were much more engaged than those who attended the lecture, showing a more active attitude throughout the whole experience and also spent more time practicing after class. Findings also suggest that the game was effective for instruction, regardless of the background of the students. However, the educational gain ob- erved with the game-based instructional approach, although effective, was not significantly higher than traditional instruction. We think that our approach is adequate to introduce CS languages in general, as well as new programming languages, and seems to be more appealing to new comers than traditional instruction.", "date_publication": "Tue Oct 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "doi": "10.1109/RITA.2015.2486386", "issue_date": "Nov. 2015", "issue": "4", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "15587232", "firstpage": "253"}, "keywords": ["XML", "computer aided instruction", "computer games", "computer science education", "programming languages", "teaching", "CS language structures", "Lost in Space", "XML markup language", "computer science languages", "educational gain", "educational videogame", "flexible architecture", "game design", "game model", "game-based instruction paradigms", "game-based learning", "incremental learning", "programming languages", "programming paradigms", "scalable architecture", "scalable game engine", "teaching", "Engines", "Games", "Programming profession", "Syntactics", "XML", "Application software", "computer programming", "educational technology", "educational videogames", "software architecture", ""], "authors": ["\u00c1ngel Serrano-Laguna", "Javier Torrente", "Borja Manero Iglesias", "Baltasar Fern\u00e1ndez-Manj\u00f3n"], "citations": [], "arnumber": "7293133"}, "Article 17": {"references": ["5280206", "4358722", "5413209", "6719187"], "details": {"sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "title": "Remote Experimentation Using a Didactical Elevator", "volume": "10", "date": "Nov. 2015", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "lastpage": "323", "pages": "319 - 323", "date_current_version": "Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issn": "1932-8540", "abstract": "The use of didactic models in industrial engineering provides students with an enhanced experimental environment to design in accordance with industrial requirements.

In particular, we study the improvement of teamwork attitude, the predominant types of motivation in different contexts, and some correlations among these three components of the learning process. The above-mentioned aspects are of great importance. Currently, the professional profile of engineers has a strong teamwork component, and the motivational profile of students determines both their tendencies when they come to work as part of a team and their performance at work. Taking these issues into consideration, we suggest four hypotheses: (H1) students improve their teamwork capacity through specific training and by carrying out a set of activities integrated into an active learning process; (H2) students with higher mastery motivation have a better attitude toward teamwork; (H3) students with different types of motivations reach different levels of academic performance; and (H4) students show different motivation profiles in different circumstances, such as types of courses, teaching methodologies, and different times of the learning process. This study was carried out with Computer Science Engineering students from two Spanish universities. The first results point to an improvement in teamwork competence of students if they have previously received specific training in facets of that competence. Other results indicate that there is a correlation between the motivational profiles of students and their perception of teamwork competence. Finally, the results point to a clear relationship between some kind of motivation and academic performance. In particular, four kinds of motivation are analyzed, and students are classified into two groups according to them. After analyzing several marks obtained in compulsory courses, we perceive that the students who show higher motivation for avoiding failure obtain, in general, worse aca- emic performance.", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "doi": "10.1109/RITA.2015.2418012", "issue_date": "May 2015", "issue": "2", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "15222083", "firstpage": "77"}, "keywords": ["computer science education", "educational courses", "educational institutions", "engineering education", "human factors", "Spanish universities", "academic performance", "active learning process", "computer science engineering students", "educational courses", "engineer professional profile", "learning process", "mastery motivation", "motivational profiles", "student attitude", "student training", "teaching methodologies", "teamwork attitude improvement", "teamwork competence improvement", "teamwork competence perception", "teamwork generic competence", "Context", "Correlation", "Data analysis", "Gaussian distribution", "Teamwork", "Training", "Engineering education", "academic performance", "generic competences", "motivation", "teamwork", ""], "authors": ["Javier Garc\u00eda-Mart\u00edn", "Jorge Enrique P\u00e9rez-Mart\u00ednez", "Almudena Sierra-Alonso"], "citations": [], "arnumber": "7086318"}, "Article 7": {"references": ["6299275", "5280206", "538754", "5492454", "4720536", "6784235", "4527087", "5210092", "6826155", "6826158", "6201105", "7044175", "6547615"], "details": {"sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "title": "Creation of Customized Remote Laboratories Using Deconstruction", "volume": "10", "date": "May 2015", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "lastpage": "76", "pages": "69 - 76", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issn": "1932-8540", "abstract": "The employment of customized remote laboratories becomes very relevant for the teaching community in distance education, since lecturers have the necessity to use real equipment through the Internet, which is adapted to the students' skills.

This paper describes several issues encountered on laboratorial classes, on higher education courses, when using remote laboratories based on PXI systems, either using the VISIR system or an alternate in-house solution. Three main issues are presented and explained, all reported by teachers, that gave support to students' use of remote laboratories. The first issue deals with the need to allow students to select the actual place where an ammeter is to be inserted on electric circuits, even incorrectly, therefore emulating real-world difficulties. The second one deals with problems with timing when several measurements are required at short intervals, as in the discharge cycle of a capacitor. In addition, the last issue deals with the use of a multimeter in dc mode when reading ac values, a use that collides with the lab settings. All scenarios are presented and discussed, including the solution found for each case. The conclusion derived from the described work is that the remote laboratories area is an expanding field, where practical use leads to improvement and evolution of the available solutions, requiring a strict cooperation and information-sharing between all actors, i.e., developers, teachers, and students.", "date_publication": "Tue Feb 04 00:00:00 EST 2014", "doi": "10.1109/RITA.2014.2302071", "issue_date": "Feb. 2014", "issue": "1", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "14115647", "firstpage": "33"}, "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "educational courses", "further education", "laboratories", "PXI systems", "RemotElectLab", "VISIR system", "ammeter", "capacitor discharge cycle", "electric circuits", "higher education courses", "information sharing", "laboratorial classes", "learning scenario", "pedagogical tool", "remote laboratories", "technological tool", "Ammeters", "Current measurement", "Education", "Electronic learning", "Laboratories", "Remote laboratories", "Learning goals", "real-world scenarios", "remote labs", ""], "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 V.

The benefits obtained are highlighted and analyzed.", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "doi": "10.1109/RITA.2014.2317531", "issue_date": "May 2014", "issue": "2", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "14318547", "firstpage": "64"}, "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "data mining", "SPL engineering", "e-learning Web miner", "e-learning application", "e-learning platforms", "manual adaptation process", "refactoring", "software product line", "software products", "software systems", "teaching-learning process", "Computer architecture", "Data mining", "Education courses", "Electronic learning", "HTML", "Software development", "Software systems", "Software product line", "data mining", "e-learning", "refactoring", ""], "authors": ["Pablo S\u00e1nchez Barreiro", "Diego Garc\u00eda-Saiz", "Marta Elena Zorrilla Pantale\u00f3n"], "citations": [], "arnumber": "6799220"}, "Article 1": {"references": ["5153123", "5238629", "5673355", "1296777", "4696067"], "details": {"sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "title": "Digital Learning Object Production in Engineering Courses", "volume": "9", "date": "May 2014", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "lastpage": "48", "pages": "43 - 48", "date_current_version": "Fri May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issn": "1932-8540", "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative-project research on promoting self-learning in engineering university courses. This paper is focused on students' homework, which consists in producing learning objects. The digital objects are self-contained and reusable within the course framework according to a suitable work plan and supported by digital tools. Additionally, in order to help the student on the achievement of curricula competences by producing these objects, they are also available to the whole group in the form of a digital collection of self-study material adapted to the group's characteristics. This paper describes a case of study, analyses students' perception of the activity, and quantifies the success of the experience.", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "doi": "10.1109/RITA.2014.2317524", "issue_date": "May 2014", "issue": "2", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "14318544", "firstpage": "43"}, "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "computer science education", "educational courses", "educational institutions", "engineering education", "further education", "computer science education", "curricula competences", "digital collection", "digital learning object production", "digital tools", "engineering courses", "engineering university courses", "group characteristics", "innovative-project research", "self-contained reusable digital objects", "self-learning promoting", "self-study material", "student experience success quantification", "student homework", "student perception analysis", "work planning", "Computer languages", "Computer networks", "Education courses", "Electronic learning", "Feedback", "Programming", "Research and development", "Software development", "Engineering", "digital learning objects", "self-centered learning", "student activities", ""], "authors": ["Sara Blanc", "Jos\u00e9 Vicente Benlloch-Dualde"], "citations": [], "arnumber": "6799250"}}}}
