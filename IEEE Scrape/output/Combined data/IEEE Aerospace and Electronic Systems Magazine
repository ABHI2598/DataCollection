The crash of a USAir DC-9 at Charlotte, NC on July 2,1994 has caused an increased focus on windshear and microburst activity. FAA, NASA, the airline industry and equipment manufacturers have been working with the problem since the 1980's, to define, design and test predictive sensor systems that would provide adequate and dependable advance warning to pilots that would allow safely executed evasive actions during take off's and landings. Three sensor systems were investigated: radar, laser radar (lidar), and infrared imaging, with the pulsed Doppler radar consistently detecting both wet and dry microbursts indicative of hazardous windshear conditions at longer ranges than the other two. Numerous documents were reviewed, including the NASA Airborne Doppler Radar together with meetings held with AlliedSignal, Rockwell Collins and Westinghouse to verify radar parameters needed to analyze and present the tester concept described herein. The weather and windshear models defined use the identical criteria established for the Doppler radar in terms of F-factor. The basic concept of the tester is to transmit coherent simulated radar returns in response to the airborne radar's transmission while mounted on a tripod in the far field of the radar when parked on the ramp. The varying amplitude of the received radar pulses are analyzed and put into memory as the tester antenna is illuminated by the scanning main beam and side lobes of the radar's antenna patterns. The tester controls the power of its outputted simulated radar returns in inverse relation to the power of the received radar pulses. These simulated radar returns, outputted into the main beam and/or side lobes of the scanning radar antenna, are interpreted by the radar system as received in the main lobe. The tester transmissi ons, incorporating microburst, storm and gust front models, previously defined, can thereby test the aircraft radar system performance in various hazard environments. The tester is designed to: verify operational performance of the radar; demonstrate installed radar performance; verify crew reports and minimize radar or LRU's removal for maintenance; test before and after a repair; and verify radome effects on radar performance.", "date_publication": "Dec. 1995", "doi": "10.1109/62.480827", "issue_date": "Dec. 1995", "issue": "12", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "5149553", "firstpage": "25"}, "keywords": ["Airborne radar", "Brain modeling", "Doppler radar", "Pattern analysis", "Power system modeling", "Radar antennas", "Random access memory", "Receiving antennas", "Storms", "System testing", ""], "authors": ["J.

The standard hardware acquisition and reliability program is working with the Aircraft Battery Group at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, Naval Air Systems Command (AIR 536), Wright Laboratory, Battelle Memorial Institute, and Concorde Battery Corporation to produce a standard INS battery. This paper discusses the approach taken to determine whether the battery should be replaced and to select the replacement chemistry. The paper also discusses the battery requirements, aircraft that the battery is compatible with, and status of Navy flight evaluation. Projected savings in avoided maintenance in Navy and Air Force INS systems is projected to be $14.7 million per year with a manpower reduction of 153 maintenance personnel.

Heretofore the listed ECCM effects have generally been to counteract the effects of ECM. This approach is one of attempting to cure an illness, rather than preventing it. Modem ECM systems usually include an ESM receiver to detect the radar signal, identify it by its emission characteristics, assess its importance, select the proper ECM, and signal to initiate ECM. If the ESM receiver detection of the radar signal can be delayed/denied, or the identification be confused, either the wrong ECM may be applied, or delayed. The radar may thus not be confronted with timely, proper ECM. Radar operation may therefore be possible. This paper introduces and defines CESM, a new category of radar ECCM. There are two principles of CESM-those which delay/deny ESM receiver detection, and those which confuse/impede signal identification. Illustrative examples of CESM techniques/operating techniques are given. It is shown that many CESM techniques may have multiple roles by impeding detection, impeding identification, and also diluting effects of ECM", "date_publication": "Feb 1995", "doi": "10.1109/62.350735", "issue_date": "Feb 1995", "issue": "2", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "4900392", "firstpage": "36"}, "keywords": ["electronic countermeasures", "radar detection", "radar receivers", "CESM", "ESM receiver", "ESM receiver detection", "antiradiation missiles", "emission characteristics", "radar ECCM", "signal identification", "Delay", "Electronic countermeasures", "Employment", "Frequency", "Impedance", "Polarization", "Radar detection", "Robustness", "Signal detection", "Signal processing", ""], "authors": ["S.

General Motors in their prototype Impact, for example, used starting-lighting-ignition batteries, which deliver lots of power for demonstrations, but have a life of less than 100 deep discharges.

In fact, some instruments are becoming closely integrated with the mobility systems that carry them to their science targets. This higher level of integration has been motivated by both resource limitations and by an increased focus in science investigations. The reduced size and budget available for individual space science missions combined with the increased complexity of these missions, has encouraged instrument developers to greater integration to reduce mass, volume, and power needs. In parallel, NASA has shifted focus from flyby and planetary orbiting missions, which primarily included remote-sensing instruments, to various types of landed vehicles, which include primarily; in-situ instruments. Initial studies of the planets on planetary scales have moved to more detailed ground truth studies on planetary surfaces. The science goals have shifted to focus on specific questions, in the case of Mars, understanding the history of water and the possibilities for life on the planet. This increased science focus has, in turn, created the need for integrated science suites that can address these questions in ways that stand-alone instruments cannot. This paper discusses a number of NASA instrument suites, ranging from those currently operating in space to those that are in early study phases. The focus of the discussion is on the trends, including the shift to greater integration, the concomitant challenges that must be overcome to achieve this integration and the benefits that can ensue.

High resolution displays of semi-transparent intervisibility overlaid on sharp clear digital maps are very convincing but can they be believed? Not completely. Intervisibility displays serve a valuable function. But to build and use these systems wisely, it is good to understand the errors and limitations involved.

The need for this proposal results from the shortcomings in the current avionics architecture, video distribution network, and in the MIL-STD-1553 data communication system. The separately wired video and data communication systems can be combined to save weight, which is especially critical for rotorcraft. Aircraft, once fielded, have limited capacity for modification and improvement due to fixed computer throughput and processing performance, network bandwidth, and space available in the avionics equipment bays. The changes proposed by this paper are to be made in conjunction with the replacement of the redundant computer boxes with open system avionics functions on industry standard circuit cards. This open architecture approach was developed over the last ten years and is now being implemented in many aircraft applications including the F-22 and the RAH-66 programs. The V-22 rotorcraft, which although just entering production, is being modified for joint service customers where modern computer performance and expanded data network bandwidth is needed. The changes of this proposal will fill this need, reduce the weight of upcoming production models, and provide growth or spare capability so that additional video and data components can be added with minimal effect on existing components.

Such use has resulted in significant cost and schedule savings in the development of production test equipment for radar and infrared systems. With open systems architectures, a test system can be assembled using COTS products. This brings economies of scale to test equipment, which is normally built in very low quantities. Therefore, the potential cost savings due to COTS usage is proportionately greater in STE than in the higher volume avionics systems that are tested. A second major benefit of using COTS products is that test system development schedule cycle time is greatly reduced. This paper describes the application of Open Systems Architectures (OSA) to avionics testing. The following major architectures are surveyed: VME bus, VXI bus, IEEE GPIB, IEEE 1149.1 JTAG test bus, 1553 Military Bus, Fibre Channel, and COTS Test Applications Software. We describe how the benefits of OSA have been extended at Raytheon into achieving vertical test commonalities. The flexibility of OSA can be exploited to provide an overall optimum test solution, taking all levels of test into account. For example, test systems can be tailored with COTS products to provide integrated methods for avionics tests at the module, unit, and system levels. Test systems can be configured to maximize the reuse of COTS hardware over all test levels. Test software can also be programmed to optimize such reuse over levels of test. Additional test verticality synergies derived from such OSA usage are described, including: test false alarm avoidance; test cones of tolerance optimization; and efficient test of field returns", "date_publication": "Aug 2001", "doi": "10.1109/62.942212", "issue_date": "Aug 2001", "issue": "8", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "7051502", "firstpage": "4"}, "keywords": ["automatic test equipment", "automatic test software", "boundary scan testing", "military avionics", "military standards", "open systems", "peripheral interfaces", "system buses", "1553 Military Bus", "COTS Test Applications Software", "COTS products", "Fibre Channel", "IEEE 1149.1 JTAG test bus", "IEEE GPIB", "VME bus", "VXI bus", "cost and schedule savings", "military avionics testing", "open systems architecture", "production test equipment", "special test equipment", "system development schedule cycle time", "Aerospace electronics", "Application software", "Computer architecture", "Costs", "Military equipment", "Open systems", "Production systems", "Software testing", "System testing", "Test equipment", ""], "authors": ["S.

These new technological capabilities alone are insufficient to reinvent the business models. Management must, through vision and solid commitment at all hierarchical levels, migrate values, reinvent precepts, coalesce processes, and redefine workforce models to remain financially viable in the emerging compressed timelines. The tools are at hand; economic realities make corporate change a financial requirement, and the changing values, goals, and social composition of the workforce apply pressure to create a new network centric workforce model. These converging pressures make rethinking the corporation viable and necessary. How rapidly these changes occur will be determined now by old-fashioned rates of human/corporate acceptance of change.

Even today when many integrated computer aided design environments are in use for electronic systems design, we still seem to accept that the design process really has to follow this path of four individual design stages. It is common that we are dealing with data transfer problems between different types of CAE-applications. However, there is a possibility to avoid the disadvantages due to integration problems between the design stages if we decide to develop the design methodology itself instead of developing those independent software applications. One effective way to improve the productivity of complex electronic systems design is to tune the so-called systematic design approach by adding special aspects of electronic systems design into the questionnaires used for collecting the requirement lists for further mechanical design and DFM. Another important tool is the carefully made manufacturability analysis. The deep interaction of mechanical and electronic design, extended by manufacturability analysis can also lead to innovative solutions as presented previously by the author. In the article entitled \u201cManufacturability Analysis-A Useful Subset of Systems Engineering\u201d we were able to show that the number of iteration cycles during the different design and manufacturing stages could be reduced by 50% compared to the conventional design methodology.

Roll decoupling of the warhead and motor section was required to allow roll control of the guidance section to enable accurate inertial navigation and was accomplished by joining the two sections with a roll bearing.

It is noteworthy that this vertical component-to be most useful and safe-must desirably provide the pilot with no more than several feet of uncertainty. Unfortunately, with GPS the vertical portion of the position information supplied the pilot by GPS signals is the least precise because of geometries involved. Augmentation for enhancement of accuracy is quite important and the assertion is that it is necessary for totally safe vertical guidance. Evidence from approximately 60 years of experience with electronic landing systems serving the public is that there has been no aircraft accident due to a defective vertical guidance signal. Visibilities as low as 600 feet horizontally can exist at certain airports and landings can still be accomplished. These landings, while not common, are being accomplished flawlessly by contemporary aircraft and equipment. Many aspects of the contemporary UHF glide slope have been studied during its half-century of use. This paper reports on advances, some of them quite recent, that make it realistic to claim that a glide slope can be sited for Category I operation at any runway that meets the physical requirements for this type of operation. For the UHF glide slope, siting imperfections are accommodated by using one of five available types of contemporary glide slope systems or derivatives thereof. This paper reviews how accommodations are achieved in practical cases.

DP is one solution method used in other industries for the problem of path planning to avoid collisions with fixed obstacles. The solution proposed here for the aircraft case uses DP applied to the moving obstacle case. The problem is first simplified by assuming fixed obstacles for the cost minimisation algorithms. These fixed obstacles are then moved with time and the minimisation process is started again. Although this method works well in most cases, situations can be constructed where this method fails, allowing a collision. A modified approach is proposed, where the movement of obstacles is included more explicitly in the cost minimisation algorithm.

The operation of simultaneous waveforms through an integrated avionics rack of shared resources becomes a test in moving data rapidly from one signal processing stage to the next. The IEEE 1394, or Firewire, is a commercial high bandwidth bus whose 64-bit addressing and maximum 400 Mbits/second throughput satisfies this demanding military avionics interconnect need. The challenge in applying this commercial product to integrated avionics is the requirement to seamlessly add message priority encoding. By having message priorities, the slower strategic communications links will not impair the performance of higher data rate tactical communications, thereby avoiding potentially life-threatening bottlenecks. The flight environment imposes additional challenges to ruggedize the cabling between integrated avionics racks and to utilize the full capabilities of the Firewire bus. A discussion of the physical, data link, network, and transport layers, as used in avionics applications will be done. Additionally, the versatility of 1394 in military avionics with its variable channel sizes, bandwidth on demand, hierarchical addressing, and upgrade to 800 and 1600 Mbps with a 64-bit wide data path, is emphasized.

Constraints on cost, size, weight, and power consumption for all communications equipment make optimization of these systems very important. These information and communication systems connect people and systems together into coherent teams performing the difficult and hazardous tasks inherent in planetary exploration. The communication network supporting vehicle telemetry data, mission operations, and scientific collaboration must have excellent reliability and flexibility. We propose hybrid communication architectures consisting of space-based links, a surface-based deployable mid-range communications network and a cluster of short-range links to solve the problems of connectivity and bandwidth, while meeting the other constraints of weight and power. A network of orbiting satellites could cover much of the planet surface, but this space-based capability may not be optimal for cost or performance. Specifically, a minimal space-based capability can be augmented using mobile cellular repeaters deployable by robots and human EVA. This method results in an increase in the number of radio nodes, but the distances separating them is decreased. This results in a significant increase in bandwidth and decrease in radio power, and therefore, node size, complexity, and power consumption.

The result was that, already in 1984, a complete new peripheral hardware design, with a very high electrical and capacitive stability, was created by Siemens AG which remains state-of-the-art. Nevertheless, even if this high-grade material is installed, it can happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences are the cause of important electrical effects.

We typically create virtual worlds that allow the user to interact with 3D real-time graphics. We refer to the virtual worlds enabling this interaction as synthetic environments. A synthetic environment produces sufficient sensory cues to make users believe they are in a different geographic location with a different velocity and orientation than they have in the real world. Classical flight simulators are a subset of synthetic environments. Although they do not usually use stereoscopic displays, they do use large FOV visual systems, digital audio, force feedback via the flight controls, and force feedback on the simulator as a whole via a motion base. We believe the addition of stereoscopic 3D graphics will be particularly valuable in hovering, formation flying, and landing. VRAC uses two surround screen environments, the C2 and the C6. The C2 came on line in 1995. It is a room with four projected surfaces, three walls and the floor. The C6, which came on line in June 2000, is a cube-shaped room, the first of its kind in the US, with 3D graphics projected on all four walls, the floor, and the ceiling. The C2 and C6 are linked by a dedicated fiber network. This will enable collaboration between geographically separated virtual worlds. Many researchers believe that collaboration between geographically separate synthetic environments is the key to future breakthroughs in the use of SE technology. The C2/C6 combination will be an ideal testbed to support this kind of collaboration. In addition, the C2 and C6 are connected to a 250-person auditorium that has dual screens capable of simultaneously displaying real-time images from two sources. Our vision is simultaneous display of real-time graphics from the C2 and the C6 in the auditorium, enabling up to 250 people to study and, perhaps, participate in the real-time interactions. As quality of service, bandwidth, and latency challenges are met by emerging technology, we also look forward to interconnecting the C2, the C6, and the auditorium with off campus simulators", "date_publication": "Sep 2001", "doi": "10.1109/62.949532", "issue_date": "Sep 2001", "issue": "9", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "7064542", "firstpage": "19"}, "keywords": ["aerospace simulation", "computer based training", "force feedback", "three-dimensional displays", "virtual reality", "3D real-time graphics", "C2/C6 combination", "aircrew training", "collaboration", "cube-shaped room", "digital audio", "dual screens", "flight controls", "flight simulation", "force feedback", "formation flying", "geographically separated worlds", "hovering", "landing", "large field of view visual systems", "sensory cues", "stereoscopic 3D graphics", "synthetic environments", "virtual reality technology", "virtual worlds", "Aerospace control", "Aerospace engineering", "Aerospace simulation", "Auditory displays", "Collaboration", "Floors", "Force feedback", "Graphics", "Virtual reality", "Visual system", ""], "authors": ["R.

However, the compact antenna test range (CATR) makes such far-field tests possible within an indoor chamber having a controlled atmosphere.

Intrepid Digital Transceiver alternately transmits pulses at two discrete frequencies within K-Band. When an intruder enters the detection zone, the Doppler response at each frequency is digitally recorded. The difference between the two frequencies is controlled so that the phase angle between the two Doppler responses can be used to determine the unambiguous range to the target. As a byproduct of the process targets approaching the transceiver can be distinguished from those moving away from the transceiver. Range information is used to enhance the signal processing.

Therefore, they can be smaller, tighter and still dissipate the waste heat that, unavoidably, goes along with the production of high output power. It is no accident that a one-megawatt cw microwave tube (1340 horsepower) is about the same size as a 1250 horsepower internal combustion engine. An assemblage of transistors or integrated circuits would be a much larger maze of circuit boards, power busses, cables, combiners, fuses, heat sinks, and, probably, water pipes. Unlike the situation that pertains for signal and data processing in which Moore's law applies, and complexity and performance increase while size and cost decrease in secular fashion, the transmitter built one hundred years from now will be no smaller and no lighter than the one you build today, unless the active elements are more efficient or run hotter than present-day microwave tubes. At ultra-high frequencies and above, solid-state technology has little hope of providing either advantage. The laws of thermodynamics are not man-made and cannot be broken. Many signals, including both analog and digital TV, digital communications, and EW, have high ratios of peak to average power. The poor efficiency of some microwave solid-state devices in class-A or class-AB operation when compared to that of class-AB gridded electron tubes and TWTs with multistage depressed collectors has interfered with their acceptance as amplifiers of such signals in both commercial and military service at UHF and higher frequencies. In this paper, new data on the new kinds of microwave tubes will be presented with emphasis on their suitability for application in economical, high-reliability, high-performance satellites, and communications, electronic warfare, and radar systems", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "doi": "10.1109/62.978360", "issue_date": "Jan 2002", "issue": "1", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "7156909", "firstpage": "19"}, "keywords": ["klystrons", "microwave tubes", "military equipment", "travelling wave tubes", "COTS device", "affordable military electronics", "constant efficiency amplifier", "convergent electron guns", "electronic warfare", "high-performance satellites", "klystron", "microwave power sources", "microwave tubes", "multistage-depressed-collector", "power conditioner", "power module", "radar systems", "solid-state devices", "travelling wave tubes", "vacuum tubes", "vacuum-electronic devices", "water-cooled aircraft engine", "Accidents", "Electromagnetic heating", "Electron tubes", "Frequency", "Microwave devices", "Power generation", "Production", "Solid state circuits", "Temperature", "Waste heat", ""], "authors": ["R.

Semiconductor devices embedded in these applications become more sensitive to space radiation as the features shrink in size. One of the adverse effects of space radiation on avionics is a transient error known as single event upset (SEU). Given that it is caused by bit-flips in computer memory, SEU does not result in a damaged device. However, the SEU induced data error propagates through the run-time operational flight program, causing erroneous outputs from a flight-critical computer system. This study was motivated by a need for a cost-effective solution to keep flight-critical computers functioning after SEU occurs. The result of the study presents an approach to recover flight-critical computer systems from SEU induced error by using an identity observer array. The identity observers replicate the state data of the controller in distinct data partitions. The faulty controller can be recovered by replacing data image of the faulty data partition with that of the healthy data partition. The methodology of applying such an approach from the fault tolerant control perspective is presented.

This technique, quite well known in the industry and deeply studied for the last century, has improved its electronic sensors, pulling down prices and, therefore, enabling its use in many more applications. The first step, as in every biometric system, is to obtain an image of the user's fingerprint. After this, a pre-processing algorithm is applied, which enables feature extraction to obtain the location and type of all minutiae, i.e., the discontinuities in the ridges and valleys of the fingerprint. Due to the fact that it is not possible to always catch the same number of minutiae, a special matching algorithm should be applied to compare the feature vector with the corresponding user's template.

Safer Practices emphasizes an integrated systematic approach to safety risk management through implementation of formalized Safety Management Systems (SMS) that incorporate safety data analysis processes, and the enhancement of methods for ensuring safety an inherent characteristic of NextGen. Safer Systems emphasizes implementation of safety-enhancing technologies, which will improve safety for human-centered interfaces and enhance the safety of airborne and ground-based systems. Safer Worldwide encourages coordinating the adoption of the safer practices and safer systems technologies, policies, and procedures worldwide, such that the maximum level of safety is achieved across air transportation system boundaries.

The real-time surveillance information from the airport control center of low attitude flights can be wirelessly transmitted in real-time to the RDS receiver in the aircrafts.

They decided to base the workshop on six detailed ease studies, each approximately 15 pages in length. The topics of the six ease studies were selected to cover a range of types of flight projects - orbiters, landers and rovers, planetary and earth missions, development and operations, spacecraft and instruments, recent past and current. By including this range of projects, they hoped to touch on a broad spectrum of systems engineering situations, issues, and challenges, and to use these to accomplish specific learning objectives. They developed a template for the case studies to ensure that specific areas were addressed in each case study, and to ensure that a ?big picture? view of the mission itself would be presented before getting into the ?meat? of the case, Then questions were designed to ensure that the workshop participants would wrestle with the systems engineering challenges presented, and would understand and absorb the systems engineering skills needed to address them. The workshop also included sessions of ?story-telling? by key Project Systems Engineers and short lecture sessions addressing key topics and concepts. This describes the approach and methodology for designing detailed case studies for use as learning tools for systems engineering training.

Wideband systems emphasize high capacity, protected systems prioritize anti-jam features and covertness, and narrowband systems emphasize support to the disadvantaged user by providing low data rate communications to small/mobile users. This focuses on the existing wideband MILSATCOM infrastructure (namely the Defense Satellite Communications System and Global Broadcast Service), because the architecture that exists is aging technology that lacks the ability to provide the required bandwidth to the warfighters without relying on commercial satellites. Bandwidth is limited and expensive to purchase, resulting in the DoD leasing transponders on commercial communications satellites - a solution that may not always be an option. This also illustrates various technologies and future programs currently being investigated by the Department of Defense (DoD) in order to augment and/or replace existing systems, and the resulting capability and benefits provided to the warfighter. These programs include the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) (previously known as Wideband Gapflller Satellite System), and the Advanced Wideband System (AWS)/Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT). Both WGS and AWSITSAT will significantly increase the bandwidth capacity of the wideband MILSATCOM architecture. These military initiatives take advantage of nascent technology such as IP router technology and laser cross-links to maximize performance. Finally, thia describes several techniques to augment these MILSATCOM programs and increase their capacity and effectiveness, including: use of a network-style approach (vice point-to-point), combining space and terrestrial systems, use of near-space communication platforms (e.g., high-altitude. UAVs or balloons), operating at higher frequencies, use of multiple satellites and re-use frequencies, and us- - e of IP accelerators.

On-line supervision of the motor drive, by means of electrical signature and harmonics analysis, can detect motor faults in its most preliminary state, thus allowing increasing the EMA reliability.

The current air-ground voice communications systems are using the more than 50-year-old analog voice transmission technology in the licensed air traffic management VHF spectrum band. The limited spectrum is allocated statically based on air traffic control organization and geographic locations. With the increasing use of data applications for air-ground communications, the demand to effectively use the limited spectrum has increased. There are several proposed approaches to solve the projected saturated spectrum in the future. However, these approaches do not address the current practice of static spectrum allocation, which this author anticipates will be a major bottleneck for effective use of the limited spectrum. The current static channel assignment creates inefficient use of the limited spectrum. Regardless of whether a channel is used, it is permanently assigned to the particular geographical areas and organizations. This prevents other users from using the channels when the channels are idle. Also, this static allocation of the spectrum constrains the reassignment of channels and creates a long transition period for moving the existing analog system to a new digital system. The emerging Cognitive Radio (CR) technology provides the opportunity to address the static allocation of spectrum issue and offer a more flexible transition approach for updating the legacy air-ground radio system. The emerging CR technology provides the sensing of surrounding environment, allowing the radio to adapt to the environment accordingly. Built on software-defined radio (SDR) technology, CR is able to employ these features with the cognitive engine and the aid of several sensors. The cognitive engine carries out these tasks by obtaining all available information from sources such as sensors, protocol layers, a policy engine, and its own ha- - rdware, and then interprets, reasons, and makes the optimum decision to adapt. Integrated with ground radio stations and centralized management systems, the CR can dynamically use the available channels based on its actual location, environment condition, and, therefore, maximize the use of the limited spectrum.", "date_publication": "May 2010", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2010.5486537", "issue_date": "May 2010", "issue": "5", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "11373442", "firstpage": "18"}, "keywords": ["air traffic", "aircraft communication", "cognitive radio", "software radio", "National Airspace System", "VHF spectrum band", "aeronautical air-ground communications", "air traffic management", "analog voice transmission technology", "centralized management systems", "cognitive engine", "cognitive radio technology", "radio stations", "software-defined radio technology", "static spectrum allocation", "Air traffic control", "Chromium", "Cognitive radio", "Communication system traffic control", "Digital systems", "Engines", "Environmental management", "Protocols", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Technology management", ""], "authors": ["Yang Wang"], "citations": ["6933791", "6913495", "7181995", "7255163", "7121239", "6712555", "7486377", "6865990", "6504195", "6398754"], "arnumber": "5486537"}}, "Issue 8": {"Article 2": {"references": ["4250283", "1256995", "1203431"], "details": {"title": "M3R AESA technology for extended air defence", "volume": "25", "date": "Aug. 2010", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "lastpage": "16", "pages": "11 - 16", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 19 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issn": "0885-8985", "abstract": "This focuses on the M3R Active Electronically Steered Antenna (AESA) System and will describe how this AESA is a step toward a fully digitized antenna with a receiver and an A/D-converter behind every antenna element and a full digital beam forming without using analogue sub arrays.

Only a few of these factors have already been studied, using specific approaches and only for certain biometric modalities, such us fingerprint and face. However, there is no general and independent methodology implemented to assess how these factors affect biometric system performance and to produce intercomparable results. Based on previous works and following procedures and requirements addressed in the International Standard ISO/IEC 19795-2 for scenario evaluations, these authors have developed a general methodology to analyze end-to-end system performance when some usability factors are modified.

Then, the methodology has been particularized defining specific protocols, methods, and considerations for each parameter to assess. Furthermore, details for analysing these parameters through different modalities have been defined.

A broad variety of candidate sensor technologies has the potential to fulfill the surveillance portion of the system. This explores the capabilities and limitations of these technologies, and suggests deploying combinations of technologies to capitalize upon their respective strengths. A discussion of algorithmic requirements draws upon the experience of the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) in the airspace. Differences and challenges in implementing an algorithm for a UAS are discussed. The broad range of UAS aerodynamic characteristics complicate the process of standardizing an algorithm for Sense & Avoid. In order to build a safety case supporting the certification of a UAS, its performance must be thoroughly evaluated. In the case of Sense & Avoid, flight testing cannot be sufficiently thorough, and instead, the simulation of the system for large numbers of aircraft encounters is recommended. This discusses the considerations in performing such simulations, and in modeling various components of the system and of the potential encounter geometries.

This tutorial serves two purposes: to survey the part of the theory that is most important for applications and to survey a number of illustrative positioning applications from which conclusions relevant for the theory can be drawn. The theory part first surveys the nonlinear filtering problem and then describes the general PF algorithm in relation to classical solutions based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the point mass filter (PMF). Tuning options, design alternatives, and user guidelines are described, and potential computational bottlenecks are identified and remedies suggested. Finally, the marginalized (or Rao-Blackwellized) PF is overviewed as a general framework for applying the PF to complex systems. The application part is more or less a stand-alone tutorial without equations that does not require any background knowledge in statistics or nonlinear filtering.

These methods are not only more suitable for a tutorial publication, but also an essential to a study of anomaly detection. Previous surveys on this subject have focused mainly on anomaly detectors developed in a statistical framework and have been based on well-known background statistical models.

The engineers who perform this work well are able to work across multiple engineering and managerial disciplines. They require outstanding technical, personal, management, and communications skills and an ability, based on experience, to work in areas where clean decisions are not possible. Furthermore, within the Space Department (SD) at the Johns Hopkins University - Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), lead system engineers are delegated responsibility for leading the development of the technical baselines and ensuring their performance robustly meets requirements. Success in these areas requires a level of capability and maturity that can only be developed through time and experience. With such a high bar being set, the question: \u201cHow does one develop high-caliber system engineers?\u201d becomes difficult to answer. Within the JHU/APL SD, prior to 2006, the primary means of attaining system engineers were through hiring experienced staff from external organizations or moving interested and capable staff from other areas of the department. This situation creates two problems within a growing organization. First, potential staff with the credentials stated above is extremely difficult to find, making it difficult for a system engineering organization to grow in the face of attrition. Second, the demographics of a system engineering organization become skewed toward older staff, limiting the organization's access to new methodologies, alternative means of collaboration, linkages to the university system and (frankly) youthful energy, to name a few. To address this need, management within the department developed a program for developing newly minted Masters Graduates. Key to this program is the recognition that system engineering is a process for communicating and organizing the work associated with the- - development and production of a specific product which is not an end to itself. As such, providing experience in both system engineering and the product-focused disciplines necessary for developing, integrating or operating space systems is critical. This describes the impetus for developing the Young Space Systems Engineers Program, key program features, problems encountered during development, and the program's successes. A strong case is made for the necessity for system engineers to understand the system engineering process and the product they produce, as well as the human element that goes into making it.", "date_publication": "June 2011", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2011.5936180", "issue_date": "June 2011", "issue": "6", "publisher": "IEEE", "firstpage": "4"}, "keywords": ["Engineering education", "Engineering profession", "Systems engineering and theory", "Systems engineering education", ""], "authors": ["Andrew S.

Any future substantial reductions in mishap rates will require extending the collision avoidance technology to systems that not only warn the pilot but also take control and fly the aircraft out of danger before returning control to the pilot. An Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto GCAS) will provide this extension of collision avoidance technology. Much work has been accomplished over the past 20 years in the developing and testing of an Auto GCAS. In the past three years, a Fighter Risk Reduction Program (FRRP) has been undertaken by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Wright Patterson Air Froce Base. This program is a joint effort between AFRL, NASA Dryden, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, and the Air Force Flight Test Center. The FRRP has advanced Auto GCAS technology to a level now capable of production transition. Results of this effort will be discussed herein. The F-16 test aircraft is shown in Figure 1. Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) is defined as collision with terrain, water, trees, or a man-made obstacle during flight prior to planned touchdown. CFIT includes mishaps where the aircraft is controllable and the pilot is actively controlling the aircraft or the pilot's ability to control the aircraft is reduced due to spatial disorientation. CFIT also includes mishaps where the aircraft is flown in controlled flight to a point where it is no longer possible to avoid unintended ground impact (attempted maneuver with insufficient altitude or airspeed, low altitude over bank, or flight into a box canyon), regardless of subsequent pilot reaction (add power, maneuver to avoid terrain, etc.). Prevention of CFIT mishaps utilizing Auto GCAS will be presented. The requirements for Auto GCAS and the order of importance of those requirements are discussed herein. This will show why pre- - vention of a nuisance warning has a higher priority than the aircraft recovery and how an automatic system can be designed to basically eliminate nuisances. Discussions will include techniques to develop nuisance criteria by utilizing a Pilot Activated Recovery System (PARS). Discussions will include how the PARS are used to improve flight safety. In 2005, a goal of reducing CFIT mishaps by 75% was established. To accomplish this goal, the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness established a Defense Safety Oversight Council (DSOC). The DSOC further chartered nine Task Force teams targeting multiple areas where mishap reduction could occur. One task force, the Aviation Safety Improvement Task Force (ASITF) was chartered with reducing aviation mishaps. The ASI TF formed integrated product teams and working groups to assess aviation mishaps and recommend feasible and effective mitigation strategies. The Safety Technology Working Group (STWG) was the ASI TF working group charged with identifying technological mitigation strategies for aviation mishap reduction. The STWG recommended Auto GCAS as the means to achieve the goal of reducing CFIT mishaps.", "date_publication": "May 2011", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2011.5871385", "issue_date": "May 2011", "issue": "5", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "12047297", "firstpage": "4"}, "keywords": ["aerospace robotics", "aircraft control", "collision avoidance", "Air Force Research Laboratory", "Fighter Risk Reduction Program", "Lockheed Martin aeronautics", "NASA Dryden", "Wright Patterson Air Froce Base", "air force flight test center", "auto GCAS", "automatic ground collision avoidance system", "controlled flight into terrain", "fighter aircraft", "flight test", "nuisance warning prevention", "Aerosapce control", "Aerospace safety", "Aerospace testing", "Collision avoidance", "Level measurement", "Navigation", "Terrain mapping", ""], "authors": ["Donald E.

For known areas of risk where faults could potentially occur, component redundancy and/or autonomous Fault Protection (FP) routines were implemented to ensure that the integrity of the mission was maintained. The goal of Cassini's FP strategy is to ensure that no credible Single Point Failure (SPF) prevents attainment of mission objectives or results in a significantly degraded mission, with the exception of the class of faults which are exempted due to low probability of occurrence. In the case of Cassini's Propulsion Module Subsystem (PMS) design, a waiver was approved prior to launch for failure of the prime regulator to properly close; a potentially mission catastrophic single point failure. However, one month after Cassini's launch when the fuel and oxidizer tanks were pressurized for the first time, the prime regulator was determined to be leaking at a rate significant enough to require a considerable change in Main Engine (ME) burn strategy for the remainder of the mission. Crucial mission events such as the Saturn Orbit Insertion (SOI) bum task which required a characterization exercise for the PMS system 30 days before the maneuver were now impossible to achieve. This details the steps necessary to support the unexpected malfunction of the prime regulator, the introduction of new failure modes which required new FP design changes consisting of new/modified under-pressure and over-pressure algorithms; all which must be accomplished during the operation phase of the spacecraft, as a result of a presumed low probability waived failure which occurred after launch.", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2011.5980604", "issue_date": "Aug. 2011", "issue": "8", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "12205766", "firstpage": "4"}, "keywords": ["aerospace engines", "aerospace propulsion", "aerospace testing", "fault diagnosis", "redundancy", "space vehicles", "Cassini mission-to-Saturn spacecraft", "Cassini spacecraft post-launch malfunction", "Saturn orbit insertion", "autonomous fault protection routines", "component redundancy", "flight hardware", "flight software", "main engine burn strategy", "mission design", "propulsion module subsystem design", "single point failure", "Aerospace safety", "Artificial intelligence", "Failure analysis", "Formal verification", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Magnetometers", "Saturn", "Space missions", "Space vehicles", ""], "authors": ["Paula S.

The pioneering Boeing and Lange/DLR fuel-cell prototype airplanes are an encouraging sign up to a point, but it seems more than bold to suggest that these models can be scaled up to commercial adequacy. The USAF/DARPA high-altitude Intel blimp provides ample carrying capacity and a ceiling of 65,000 feet, but again, not much of a useful turn of speed. Popular Science has reported on multiple-gas vehicles like the Sanswire STS-111 Stratellite and airship concepts such as Igor Pasternak's Aeroscraft. Of these, only the last seems to be well-targeted toward the goal, according to some accounts. This undertakes to apply some of the perennial concerns participants to a global fleet of dirigibles featuring fuel-cell-powered propulsion. That is, it adopts a global-system view taking the development of suitable vehicles for granted, rather than focusing on the vehicle innovations as their developers must primarily do.

The Eagle has landed.\u201d Two obscure errors almost prevented these words from being spoken. The errors were not made by the crew of Apollo 11 or by the controllers in Houston, nor were they made during the mission. Rather, they were made by engineers and managers years before the flight. How they happened, and how they went substantially undetected and effectively ignored, is a pair of lessons in system integration that avionics engineers must never forget. The Apollo Program is justly famed as a giant leap for the techniques of management of complex system design and implementation. Nonetheless, these tools were used by human beings and so, necessarily, imperfectly. One of the most challenging tasks in any complex system is controlling and testing the interfaces between major components that are developed by different organizations. Among the management tools deployed by NASA were Interface Control Documents (ICDs). This author has not been able to determine whether this phrase was first coined for the Apollo program or the Mercury and Gemini programs that preceded it, but it was certainly a major tool in Apollo. One of the errors under discussion herein was caused by a blatant failure to update an ICD in response to an engineering change, which can be classed as a management error of omission. The other is much subtler, involving a question of how previously unsuspected vulnerabilities (to crew procedures, in this case) should be communicated when they fall outside the scope of an ICD, yet turn out to have relevance to the way the interface is used. This becomes a problem because an ICD is a top-level document limited to specifying the design parameters of one sub-system insofar as they are of concern to one other sub-system. It's not surprising that the symptoms caused by the latter problem have been totally misunderstood by almost everyone from President Nixon on down, and only partially understood even by Buzz Ald- - rin, who along with Neil Armstrong, had to deal with them at the time. This misunderstanding is so widespread that almost everyone with any acquaintance with the Program Alarms during the Apollo 11 landing believes that the LM's Primary Guidance Navigation System (PGNS) \"failed\" in some way and had to be rescued by human intervention. That is the exact opposite of the truth, which is that performance margins built into this very robust system quarantined the effects of the errors so that the landing could proceed with the designed level of human involvement, specifically dodging the \"field of boulders\" that the PGNS could know nothing about. This is largely a retelling of the higher-level parts of a paper, Tales from the Lunar Module Guidance Computer by this author's colleague Don Eyles [1], but with the orientation changed from a historical narrative to a cautionary tale with recommendations for modern avionics development management.

Failures of the control systems in the process of long-time flights considerably reduce their reliability and, consequently, raise expenses in this field. In particular, this requires an additional backup of satellites-retransmitters, which results in an increase of the number of SFV launches. At present, experts are actively elaborating the hypothesis that one of the most probable causes of the SFV electronic system failures are the flows of the space dust particles, moving in the near-Earth and interplanetary space, and possessing velocities from 7.8 km/sec to 16 km/sec. The flows of the high energy (Galactic) ions, for a number of cases, are considered to be the basic cause of the destruction of electronic control systems. This, in particular, makes it possible to explain the failures in flights to Mars of the autonomous space modules performed by the European and American space agencies. The optimum flight route to Mars passes through agglomerations of dust clouds, which necessitates a high probability of collision for the flying vehicles with dust clots. Therefore, the success of the American research module is quite logical, which was done with the highest deviation from the optimum route.", "date_publication": "April 2009", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2009.4839276", "issue_date": "April 2009", "issue": "4", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "10588838", "firstpage": "44"}, "keywords": ["cosmic dust", "reliability", "space vehicle electronics", "autonomous space modules", "control systems failures", "dust clouds", "electronic control systems", "electronic equipment", "long-time flights", "navigation electronic elements", "space dust high-velocity particle", "space flying vehicles", "Aerospace electronics", "Clouds", "Control systems", "Electronic equipment", "Mars", "Remotely operated vehicles", "Satellite navigation systems", "Space shuttles", "Space stations", "Space vehicles", ""], "authors": ["A.

A \"university-class\" spacecraft is defined as one whose mission includes the training of university students in spacecraft engineering. The success of these 100 missions has varied widely; one-fifth were lost to launch failures, one-fifth were deployed but failed almost immediately, while one-quarter of these student-built satellites were operational for at least three years. While none can deny the established fact of student-built spacecraft, there is little discussion in either the education or engineering literature about the merits of this fact. Should universities be in the practice of building and launching their own spacecraft? Given the tremendous costs of building and operating student-built spacecraft as measured in student/faculty hours, dollars, donations, and, especially, the 5-7 year process from concept to launch - are such spacecraft worth the cost? If so, what kinds of missions are best suited for university-class satellites? To answer these questions, this survey draws upon launch records, published reports, and project communications to create a statistical examination of these hundred student-built spacecraft, identifying correlations between reliability, size, and the types of schools building space hardware. In particular, there is a strong distinction between government-sponsored \"flagship\" universities and \"independent\" schools lacking strong external support - both in terms of mission relevance and on-orbit performance. Given that distinction, we offer suggestions for independent schools to improve their missions and their orbital success.

A typical airplane system could be made up of one or more black boxes each having its own enclosure and providing for its own power conditioning and cooling needs. I/O signal conditioning and computational processing necessary to provide the intended function is also provided on a box-by-box basis. With each new generation of airplanes, the number of systems increased. Driven by market forces the need grew to reduce weight and electrical power to keep the airplane fuel efficient, cost-effective, and competitive. To address this contradiction, the Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) concept was born. Within IMA architectures, avionics functions share common resources. Multiple black boxes are optimized to the minimum IMA resources necessary. This optimization provides the sought-after weight and power savings, and also provides for a much reduced number of parts to be maintained and controlled. These are all beneficial for the airplane manufacturer and airplane operator. However, MIMA architectures present some unique challenges during their development and integration. This will explore some of the more significant of these integration challenges associated with IMA architectures, including: What is the system? For the supplier whose system has been selected to be hosted on the IMA platform, the boundaries can be unclear. What was once a box with circuit cards and substance has been abstracted to a software application. Connection to other systems or to sensorsteffectors was via airplane wiring. Now, complex in-line electronics modules exist that the supplier knows little or nothing about. For the provider of the IMA platform, the system may be defined as a set of available resources (processing, communication, 1/0, etc.) to be shared by the systems to be hosted. To the airplane manufacturer the system is a working suite of avionics. - With the LMA approach: \"Who is responsible for ensuring that boundaries and expectations are clearly defined and understood so that nothing gets overlooked?\" Who is the system integrator? Within the IMA environment the answer changes depending on your perspective. The supplier of a hosted function may be considered responsible for the integration of their system components. The IMA platform provider may believe they are responsible for the platform elements. The airplane manufacturer wants an integrated solution. With the IMA approach: \"Who is responsible for ensuring that the whole is equal to the sum of its parts?\" How is the integration of an IMA architecture handled? As more and more of the hosted systems are brought together, IMA architectures can present challenges not seen with federated systems. The nature of IMA architectures requires more of the components to be available and working to allow seemingly simple tasks to take place.

Linear sequences work fairly well, but they are difficult and expensive to generate, and are usually not capable of responding to contingencies. Any anomalous behavior while executing a linear sequence generally results in the spacecraft entering a safe mode. Critical sequences like orbit insertions which must be able to respond to faults without going into safe mode are particularly difficult to design and verify. The effort needed to generate command sequences can be reduced by extending the vocabulary of sequences to include more sophisticated control constructs. The simplest extensions are conditionals and loops. Adding these constructs would make a sequencing language look more or less like a traditional programming language or scripting language, and would come with all the difficulties associated with such a language. In particular, verifying the correctness of a sequence would be tantamount to verifying the correctness of a program, which is undecidable in general. We describe an extended vocabulary for non-linear sequencing based on the architectural notion of cognizant failure. A cognizant failure architecture is divided into components whose contract is to either achieve (or maintain) a certain condition, or report that they have failed to do so. Cognizant failure is an easier condition to verify than correctness, and it can provide high confidence in the safety of the spacecraft. Because cognizant failure inherently implies some kind of representation of the intent of an action, the system can respond to contingencies in more robust and general ways.

A back-propagation neural network (BPNN)-aided K*F algorithm and a fuzzy inference-based KF algorithm are presented in order to overcome the time delay of RDSS positioning provided by a double-star positioning system in China. Traditional KF causes biased solutions, and indeed, leads to filter instability easily since the time delay of RDSS positioning, in an active mode, is hard to be modeled and sometimes suffers from RDSS outages. Therefore, a fuzzy inference is used to correct the variance matrix of KE measurement noises adaptively; and a trained BPNN corrects the outputs of the Kalman filter. The algorithms proposed herein have been verified on real SINSIRDSS data. collected in land vehicle tests and are compared with other approaches. The results demonstrate that fuzzy inference-based KF algorithms improve the positioning accuracy to over 40 % better than KF algorithms, and BPNN-aided KF algorithms have the same precision as GPS which is the reference station In dynamic experiments without RDSS outages.

As communication technology improves, organizations can operate over wider distances and can even assemble operational components on an ad-hoc basis to meet requirements of a specific objective. Future air traffic communication studies are already discussing whether to operate IP networks that are combining voice and data transport. The problem is that although voice and data are using a common infrastructure, they remain separate at the application level. Probably, some service providers have already enjoyed reduced network infrastructure and operational costs by merging voice and data transport, but the majority may have failed to realize the significant cost, productivity, and service differentiation capabilities that converged, collaborative applications could bring. This elaborates mechanisms needed for a robust and globally interconnected network environment (including infrastructure, systems, processes, and people) in which data is shared timely and seamlessly among users, applications, and platforms. Such an environment enables substantially improved situational awareness and shortened decision-making cycles.

Herein, we describe preliminary results from an ATI GMTI experiment. The SAR data described were collected by the dual-frequency NASA/JPL airborne radar in its standard dual-baseline ATI mode. The radar system imaged a variety of control targets including a pick-up truck, sport utility vehicles, passenger cars, a bicycle, and pedestrians over multiple flight passes. The control targets had horizontal velocities of less than 5 m/s. The cross-sections of the targets were not purposely enhanced, although the targets' reflectivities may have been affected by the existence of the GPS equipment used to record the targets' positions. Single-look and multiple-look interferograms processed to the full azimuth resolution were analyzed. In the data processed to date, all of the targets were observed by visual inspection in at least one of the four combinations of dual-frequency, dual-baseline interferometric data.

The Narrow-Band Zone model is developed for that purpose. The spectral transmission and absorption factors are introduced, and the equations between radiative heat flux and the temperature of waill surfaces and gas are developed. The radiative heat transfer in one axisymmetric cylindrical enclosure filled with homogeneous radiative participating medium is computed with the Narrow-Band Zone model and compared with those in the reference documents. The comparison shows good agreement. The radiative heat transfer to the nozzle of one rocket engine is also calculated with the Narrow-Band Zone model, and the outgoing radiative energy flux and energy rate integrated in a mid-wave infrared band 2-6 pm, a long-wave infrared band 8-14 pm and the full wave band are analyzed. The following conclusions can be derived: the spectral radiation from the inlet and outlet of the nozzle show apparent spectral discontinuity, which appears greater in the 2.7-2.95 pm than in the neighboring wave band. The spectral outgoing radiative energy flux of nozzle wail is similar to that of gray body, which decreases with wavelength in 2-14 pm. The outgoing radiative energy flux on the nozzle wall is greater in the cylindrical and contracting section of nozzle, but smaller in the divergent section, which is determined by temperature. The nozzle of the rocket engine radiates most energy in the mid-wave surfaces by absorption.

However, the system boundaries are different when systems are hosted in an Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) platform. The boundaries lie within shared resources, and thus lead to greater dependencies between systems. This drives new design considerations for system architects. The natural tendency is to leverage traditional federated design concepts when building systems for IM1A environments, but this can lead to inefficient use of system resources, and a lack of preparedness for the inevitable change that will occur within the integrated set of systems. NMA has become a standard in the civil and military aviation industries, so it is important to understand these new design considerations. The question addressed by this paper is \"What unique design considerations are there for systems hosted on an IMA platform ?\" All of the considerations can be attributed to three main drivers present in the IMA environment: * 1) optimization of system resources across the integrated set of hosted systems, * 2) change containment when hosted systems change, and * 3) change containment when the NMA platform elements change (technology insertion). These three factors impact the traditional developmental independence between systems since it requires the architect to consider their system's role within the integrated set of systems. They must now consider how they will tolerate changes that are out of their control, such as changes to other hosted systems or the IMA platform that affect the shared resource performance. They must now consider how they contribute to the efficient use of system resources as part of the greater system-wide optimization strategy. If these factors are not addressed, then it can lead to wasted system resources, increased development costs, and high costs-of-change. Therefore the incentive to ensure that these new design consi- derations are addressed lies with both the system integrator who owns the integrated set of systems and the architect of each hosted system. This is based upon the authors' experience in developing 11%A systems at GE Aviation.

This interactive method is especially useful for space systems education and instruction involving hands-on tool usage and team projects. The objectives, procedures, design and development, and application experiences for this concept are documented herein. The E-class concept is part of a larger Aerospace Institute plan to make available synchronous and asynchronous learning materials via electronic media. The broader scope of this effort includes the recording and broadcast of live classes, the creation of a course content repository for anytime, anywhere corporate Web access, and the E-class concept discussed. Students benefit by being exposed to hands-on usage of principal system engineering tools and processes in a team-project environment. The integration of this interactive approach within the context of space system engineering instruction provides immediate demonstration and reinforcement of principal concepts, procedures, and tool usage benefits and issues. These benefits are exemplified by application of E-class methods to a Space Systems Concept Development course. There are other factors that play into the corporation's consideration of changing the current instructor lecture via course-hook-based instruction, using a single computer/projector system, to a classroom populated by student laptop computers. Besides the interactive advantages mentioned above, the E-class concept permits students to view and annotate course materials on their individual laptops, browse in real-time to research resources online, and work on single or group exercises. The institute's Training and Development Representatives and instructors also benefit by allowing students to take test- s and complete evaluation forms online. These capabilities provide significant advantages over the current classroom instructional format. There are, of course, trade-offs realized by applying the E-class concept in terms of the workload on the administrative and technical staffs. On the one hand, less time is spent on document creation, editing, and reproduction. The E-class concept, however, requires computer skills, software, and keyboard time in excess of the traditional course delivery method. The E-class concept, as implemented by the Aerospace Corporation, consists of a dedicated server, individual student laptop computers, and power and network connectivity via distributed classroom floor-wired hubs. This hub arrangement allows pod-configuration seating of the students that facilitates a team working-group environment. The concept is mobile between several candidate classrooms.

Simulations here of synthetic remote sensing pixels comprised of observed high-resolution fire data together with ash or vegetation background demonstrate that fire properties including flame temperature, fractional area, and radiant-energy flux can best be estimated from concurrent radiance measurements at wavelengths near 1.6, 3.9, and 12 pm. Successful observations at night may be made at scales to at least 1 kmn for the cluster of fire data simulated herein. During the daytime, uncertainty in the composition of the background and its reflection of solar radiation would limit successful observations to a scale of approximately 100 mn or less. Measurements at three wavelengths in the long-wave infrared would be unaffected by reflected solar radiation and could be applied to separate flame properties in a binary system of flame and background. However, likely variation in the composition of the background and its temperature limit the approach to measurements that are of high resolution in relation to the scale of the flaming front.

Simply using guidelines from the DO-178B and the ARINC 653 standards does not guarantee that one will be able to have multiple applications running at different safety criticality levels. One needs to be able to merge applications written by different vendors, reuse applications from previous projects, and integrate different safety requirements while constructing a safety case for the overall IMA system. This, of course, must be done within a constrained budget that includes potential costs associated with changing program requirements. In order to achieve these goals, the design life cycle must be constructed in a way that allows for configuration and build partitioning of these applications, in parallel with the IMA platform itself and the overall systems integration.

The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5 % of the maritime containers, that arrive in, or transition through, North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites, and are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically-unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 times as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than $10 per container. This presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are currently being conducted) of such a low-cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called \"FM Tag\") that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VBF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.", "date_publication": "Sept. 2009", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2009.5282284", "issue_date": "Sept. 2009", "issue": "9", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "10917655", "firstpage": "10"}, "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "VHF antennas", "containers", "Canada", "FM broadcast signal", "GPS", "North America", "US", "VHP antenna", "container tracking technologies", "frequency spectrum", "maritime containers tracking", "market globalization", "metal enclosure", "Containers", "Frequency", "Global Positioning System", "Globalization", "Inspection", "North America", "Power generation economics", "Road transportation", "Satellite broadcasting", "Security", ""], "authors": ["Reni Schmidt", "Andre Gagnon", "Dave Allcock"], "citations": ["6170896", "6187192"], "arnumber": "5282284"}, "Article 4": {"references": ["1008988", "387971", "4107998", "686810", "1035396", "1039401", "570743", "1035394"], "details": {"title": "Rapid Star Tracking Algorithm for Star Sensor", "volume": "24", "date": "Sept. 2009", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "lastpage": "33", "pages": "23 - 33", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 09 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issn": "0885-8985", "abstract": "A rapid star tracking algorithm is proposed.

The ATS consists of the automatic test equipment (ATE), the test program sets (TPSs), and associated software. The associated software includes the architecture the TPSs run on, known as the control software or test station test executive. In some cases, to sustain the legacy ATS, it is more practical to develop a replacement ATE with the latest instrumentation, often in the form of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software. The existing TPSs, including their hardware and test programs, then need to be transported, or translated, to the new test station. In order to understand how to sustain a legacy ATS by translating TPSs, one must realize the full architecture of the legacy ATS to be replaced. It must be understood that TPS transportability does not only include translating the original TPS from an existing language (such as ATLAS) to a new language (such as \"C\") to run on a new test station, but includes transporting the run-time environment created by the legacy ATS.

This solution uses commercially available products including National Instruments\u2122 TestStand\u2122 and LabVIEW\u2122 and Microsoft\u00ae Visual Basic\u00ae. The system is a four-tiered architecture to drive all test execution. The user interface is written in Visual Basic and allows the user to interact with the test execution when needed. This user interface in turn calls tests that are written in TestStand, and finally the individual tests call driver functions written in LabVIEW.

The use of this database allows for easy querying of measurement data to analyze trends in failures that help diagnose specific problems. By using this database, all test limits and test displays are contained in one central location that enables engineers to change these displays and limits on the fly without needing to change or even understand any test code.

Basically, a barometric altimeter is a pressure sensor. It measures the atmospheric static pressure and translates it to the vertical height using a predetermined formula. However, as long as all aircraft are equipped with the same kinds of instruments, the vertical separation in any controlled air space is assured. Until recent years, all flight levels (FL) above 290 must be separated by 2000 feet. It was accomplished this way primarily because of the unknown performance of barometric altimeters. By reason of increasing congestion in the air traffic routes near the North Atlantic, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the US = conducted a series of flight tests near Cardiff Wales, UK, to determine whether the separation above FL 290 can be safely reduced to 1000 feet, which would result in doubling the available routes. During these flight tests, a Boeing 727 (tail number N40) was equipped with many recording devices as well as Global Positioning System (GPS). The GPS receiver had capabilities of measuring carrier phase of the received signals so that 3D positions with respect to WGS-84 during the entire flights can be determined down to centimeter accuracy. Among the four (4) takeoff-landing tests, the aircraft conducted these tests using two flying patterns alternatively: Figure-8 with flight level gradually increased from FL 290 to 410 and Racetrack with constant flight level. We observed that the barometric altimeter measurements resemble the kinematic GPS altitude closely except an apparent low frequency difference. In other words, the barometric altimeter had short term accuracy, which would be as good as the kinematic GPS. The objective of this paper is to document these findings. Based on the actual data, we conclude that barometric altimeters are extremely accurate sensors for altitude in the sense of short-term accuracy.", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2005.1576100", "issue_date": "Dec. 2005", "issue": "12", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8709641", "firstpage": "24"}, "keywords": ["aerospace testing", "aircraft instrumentation", "altimeters", "pressure sensors", "Global Positioning System", "atmospheric static pressure", "barometric altimeter", "flight test", "recording device", "short-term accuracy analysis", "Aerospace control", "Air traffic control", "Aircraft", "Atmospheric measurements", "FAA", "Global Positioning System", "Instruments", "Kinematics", "Pressure measurement", "Testing", ""], "authors": ["Wang Tang", "G.

Advances in the use of color and image fusion techniques have been developed to maximize the information available in the initial view shown on the monitor. Different techniques are appropriate depending upon the size of the inspection item. Inspection of checked and carry-on baggage requires imaging methods that would not be appropriate for use on larger, more complex objects such as cargo containers or whole trucks. Color-coded presentation of CT images of baggage imposes yet other demands. Comparative images and analyses are presented to support choices for imaging on L-3 Communications systems in terms of the conflicting requirements of cost, sensitivity, resolution, and penetration. A number of enhancements are available to the operator and their influence on system performance is explored. Some experimental enhancements are demonstrated and their trade-offs discussed. The imaging system is ultimately based on hardware, and the choice of detectors, amplifiers, and sampling methods plays an important role in overall performance. Image degradation can be caused by deficiencies in the imaging hardware. Effects such as detector cross-talk and afterglow will negatively impact system performance. Recognition of these factors and steps to mitigate them are discussed. The effect of X-ray source choices such as beam voltage, milliamps, and sampling rate has a direct influence on the image quality and bag dose.

In general, INS/GPS integration provides reliable navigation solutions by overcoming each of their shortcomings, including signal blockage for GPS and growth of position errors with time for INS. Present Kalman filtering INS/GPS integration techniques have some inadequacies related to the stochastic error models of inertial sensors, immunity to noise, and observability. This paper aims to introduce a multi-sensor system integration approach for fusing data from INS and GPS utilizing artificial neural networks (ANN). A multi-layer perceptron ANN has been recently suggested to fuse data from INS and differential GPS (DGPS). Although being able to improve the positioning accuracy, the complexity associated with both the architecture of multi-layer perceptron networks and its online training algorithms limit the real-time capabilities of this technique. This article, therefore, suggests the use of an alternative ANN architecture. This architecture is based on radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, which generally have simpler architecture and faster training procedures than multi-layer perceptron networks. The INS and GPS data are first processed using wavelet multi-resolution analysis (WRMA) before being applied to the RBF network. The WMRA is used to compare the INS and GPS position outputs at different resolution levels. The RBF-ANN module is then trained to predict the INS position errors and provide accurate positioning of the moving platform. Field-test results have demonstrated that substantial improvement in INS/GPS positioning accuracy could be obtained by applying the combined WRMA and RBF-ANN modules.", "date_publication": "March 2005", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2005.1412121", "issue_date": "March 2005", "issue": "3", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8440670", "firstpage": "8"}, "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "Kalman filters", "computerised instrumentation", "computerised navigation", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "multilayer perceptrons", "neural nets", "radial basis function networks", "sensor fusion", "Kalman filtering INS/GPS integration", "RBF neural networks", "artificial neural networks", "differential GPS", "global positioning system", "inertial navigation system", "multilayer perceptron ANN", "multilayer perceptron network", "multisensor system integration", "online INS/GPS integration", "online training algorithm", "radial basis function neural network", "wavelet multiresolution analysis", "Artificial neural networks", "Filtering", "Fuses", "Global Positioning System", "Inertial navigation", "Kalman filters", "Multilayer perceptrons", "Observability", "Radial basis function networks", "Stochastic resonance", ""], "authors": ["R.

While there are few degrees of freedom or alternative methods when using fingerprint or iris identification techniques, speech offers much more flexibility and different levels to perform recognition: the system can force the user to speak in a particular manner, different for each attempt to enter. Also, with voice input, the system has other degrees of freedom, such as the use of knowledge/codes that only the user knows, or dialectical/semantical traits that are difficult to forge. This paper offers an overview of the state-of-the-art in speaker recognition, with special emphasis on the pros and cons, and the current research lines. The current research lines include improved classification systems, and the use of high level information by means of probabilistic grammars. In conclusion, speaker recognition is far away from being a technology where all the possibilities have already been explored.", "date_publication": "May 2005", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2005.1432568", "issue_date": "May 2005", "issue": "5", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8448832", "firstpage": "7"}, "keywords": ["biometrics (access control)", "speaker recognition", "classification systems", "dialectical trait", "high level information", "probabilistic grammars", "semantical traits", "speaker recognition", "speech technologies", "Biometrics", "Fingerprint recognition", "Humans", "Information security", "Internet", "Iris", "Natural languages", "Speaker recognition", "Speech processing", "Speech recognition", ""], "authors": ["M.

Just as spread spectrum technology has revolutionized the communications industry UWB is dramatically changing radar signal processing. These advanced signal processing techniques are adapted to leaky coaxial cable technology in the next generation GUIDAR to provide new features and enhanced performance. At the core of the new technology is an ultra high-speed digital correlator implemented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Complementary orthogonal codes based on Golay codes are used to produce thumbtack correlation functions simultaneously in multiple range bins. The net result is \"near continuous wave (CW)\" performance (97% duty cycle) in forty to eighty 11.6-meter long-range bins with targets located within one meter along the length of cable. This is a dramatic improvement over the 3% duty cycle of the original GUIDAR and the typical 100 to 200 meter long zones of current CW leaky cable sensors. Orthogonal complementary codes are transmitted on each of two leaky coaxial cables. The responses from the parallel receive cables are fed to a direct digital receiver. The orthogonal nature of the code allows the composite coded pulse response to be de-multiplexed into the independent response for each of the two cables. This ultra-high speed correlation process involves the addition and subtraction of the sampled in-phase and quadrature-phase responses to the multiple range bin accumulators at 10 million samples per second. Synchronous sampling at twice the chip rate ensures that each target is observed in three adjacent sample bins. The phase and amplitude response in the three adjacent samples are combined to precisely pinpoint (within 1 meter) the locations of targets along the length of each of the two cables. The ability to precisely locate and track multiple simultaneous targets on each of two cables leads to numerous new features and performance benef- - its relative to existing leaky cable sensors. With a separate calibrated threshold for every meter of cable the sensor sensitivity is much more uniform and installation restrictions on burial depth, cable spacing, and medium homogeneity can be relaxed. Potential sources of nuisance alarms can easily be located and overcome. The pinpoint location can be used to provide better CCTV assessment, target capture for video motion sensors and more effective response to intrusions. Through the use of parallel cables the sensor can be used to detect the direction of crossing and to classify targets such as small animals, people, and vehicles. This patented next generation of GUIDAR technology represents a dramatic step forward from that which was introduced at the 1976 Carnahan Conference in Lexington, Kentucky, and the numerous CW leaky coaxial cable sensors that evolved from that work. This technology effectively addresses residential, commercial, industrial, and governmental requirements including those relating to homeland security, military operations, and prisons.", "date_publication": "May 2005", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2005.1432570", "issue_date": "May 2005", "issue": "5", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8440675", "firstpage": "16"}, "keywords": ["Golay codes", "coaxial cables", "field programmable gate arrays", "radar signal processing", "sensors", "ultra wideband radar", "CCTV assessment", "CW leaky cable sensors", "GUIDAR technology", "Golay codes", "amplitude response", "burial depth", "cable spacing", "complementary orthogonal codes", "composite coded pulse response", "direct digital receiver", "field programmable gate array", "guided radar", "leaky coaxial cable technology", "medium homogeneity", "nuisance alarms", "parallel receive cables", "phase response", "pinpoint location", "sensor sensitivity", "spread spectrum technology", "synchronous sampling", "target capture", "target location", "thumbtack correlation functions", "ultra high-speed digital correlator", "ultra wide band radar signal processing", "video motion sensors", "Array signal processing", "Coaxial cables", "Communication industry", "Correlators", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Radar signal processing", "Sampling methods", "Spread spectrum radar", "Target tracking", "Ultra wideband radar", ""], "authors": ["K.

The major problem Is that this undertaking is both time-consuming and expensive. With budgets decreasing, program managers have to find innovative ways to do more with less. To find those innovative ways, we must look at non-traditional methods of TPS development. We must be willing to consider that there are alternate solutions, and we must take them Into consideration when making a decision on which ATS to re-host our TPSs. This paper will discuss one of the alternative solutions to re-hosting TPSs that will realize significant savings in both time and money over the use of traditional ATS. Specifically we will talk about using an in circuit test system (PinPoint II from DiagaoSYS Systems, Inc.) to re-host digital circuit boards from a legacy ATS and the techniques used to accomplish this task. This approach is not intended to fit all situations, but in the right situation, it can be very effective. To get the most out of this approach, it is important to identify exactly which TPSs: are good candidates, and which are not. To illustrate how this can be done, the process used by the AWACS program to find a cost-effective way of re-hosting TPSs from their obsolete depot tester (AN/GSM-285) will be outlined. The outline will describe the criteria used to determine which circuit cards are good candidates, and the differences in techniques used with this approach compared to traditional TPS development. It will also describe the limitations as well as the benefits obtained by using this approach. Examples will be given that illustrate the cost savings that can be realized over the use of traditional ATS.", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2005.1499289", "issue_date": "Aug. 2005", "issue": "8", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8601181", "firstpage": "16"}, "keywords": ["automatic test equipment", "military equipment", "printed circuits", "ATS", "AWACS program", "DiagaoSYS Systems, Inc.", "PinPoint II", "TPS re-host", "TPSs", "automatic test systems", "circuit cards", "digital circuit boards", "test program sets", "Aging", "Automatic testing", "Circuit testing", "Costs", "Digital circuits", "Financial management", "Innovation management", "Modems", "System testing", "Weapons", ""], "authors": ["P.

For government and industry planners concerned with future security improvements, being able to predict the overall Impact of new technologies and/or procedures is an important issue, especially in the deployment of advanced airport security equipment. Recognized as part of the issue Is that new security systems must be installed In and function as part of operating airports, which, throughout the entire process, must continue to handle ongoing operational requirements in a competitive and cost-efficient manner to the satisfaction and safety of their customers - the airlines and traveling public. One approach to gaining a better understanding of this issue, as well as any new technologies and their impact in an airport's operational environment, is by using modeling and simulation tools. Modeling and simulation has become an effective way to target new technology advancements and operational concepts and to evaluate the behavior of complex systems, offering the opportunity to examine the complexities of the airport environment In a non-intrusive and cost-effective way, while also offering the means to evaluate, assess, and fine-tune equipment selections, configurations, and other operational factors without actually deploying or installing expensive security equipment or reconfiguring secure areas of the airport environment, unnecessarily interrupting passenger and baggage flow through an airport. in the long run, this will result In the implementation of more effective and efficient airport security solutions.", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2005.1499286", "issue_date": "Aug. 2005", "issue": "8", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8601178", "firstpage": "3"}, "keywords": ["aerospace simulation", "airports", "security", "airlines", "airport security", "civil aviation security", "modeling tools", "operational environment", "safety", "simulation tools", "traveling public", "Air safety", "Air transportation", "Airports", "Cities and towns", "FAA", "National security", "Terrorism", "US Government", ""], "authors": ["D.

GPS signals are among these \"restricted\" bands. Several groups in the GPS community have conducted experimental studies concerning the impact of UWB interference on the performance of various grades of commercial and aviation GPS receivers. In this paper, we present a software approach to simulate and evaluate UWB interference on GPS receivers. The software approach provides greater flexibility in the design of testing scenarios, such as the inclusion of a large number of aggregated UWB devices, the generation of new UWB signals and modulation schemes, and the possibility of extending the study to new GPS signals. The paper discusses a general framework for developing algorithms to evaluate UWB and GPS interference under a wide variety of hardware and software conditions. This framework consists of three classes of components: input, processing, and analysis. The input components are responsible for the generation of UWB signal waveforms and modulation schemes, and GPS signals. The processing components include a simulated model of GPS RF front end and software implementation of GPS processing blocks, such as acquisition, tracking, and post-processing. The analysis components focus on the study of specific receiver processing component outputs. Both real and simulated UWB signals can be used in the study. The real UWB signals are primarily used to validate the simulation procedure, whereas the simulated UWB signals are used to allow the immediate incorporation of new UWB waveforms and modulations in the evaluations.

One of the limiting factors in testing mixed signal or analog devices using standard bus based instruments is the transfer speed from the instrument to the controlling computer of large amounts of waveform data. This is important as these types of tests use non-deterministic, quantized signals that must be mathematically processed to extract test information. This processing can either be done at the instrument or at the central controller. If the processing is done at the instrument then only the results are transferred to the controller. If the controller does the processing then the raw data must be transferred to and from the instrument. Using two instruments, one in VXI and one in PXI, this paper measures the effects of typical tests contesting the measurements as done in the central processor as opposed to a distributed DSP processor in each instrument For each acquisition instrument, tests were implemented by capturing the data and moving it to the controlling computer where it was processed to extract test results, or by using the instruments on-board DSP so only the final test results were set to the controlling computer.

The sensor with the trademarked name \"MICROTRACK\" is similar to the \"MICROPOINT\" fence sensor with precise detection location, sensitivity leveling, and free format zoning. Intruder location is accomplished with low-power ultra wideband frequency stepped radar driving the sensor cables. Target range resolution also allows the use of sensitivity leveling for each individual range bin. This will compensate for differences in soil conductivity along the length of the cable and for metal objects, which may be located in the near field radiation. The design of the MICROTRACK sensor was presented at the 2002 Carnahan Conference in Atlantic City. It has been described as FM-CW radar, however it differs from the generic form in that the frequency is stepped rather than continuously swept and phase code modulation is added to discriminate against interference. The wide bandwidth of the MICROTRACK sensor fills in the s typical of a single frequency radar and provides a more uniform field profile along the entire length of the sensor cables. This describes the testing that has been performed to characterize the system for different environmental conditions. Southwest Microwave, Inc. has procured an open field site of 31 acres of flat desert land for testing the buried cable. Another site in Canada is used for testing with an additional set of weather and soil conditions. Detection patterns, proximity to stationary objects, and various environmental factors will be discussed. Extensive measurements of both electric and magnetic fields along the length and perpendicular to the sensor cables show a detailed map of the multiple frequency surface wave. When the cables are buried, the uniformity of the field is degraded slightly but no deep s are observed. Site testing has confirmed major benefits of the MICROTRACK sensor: - Uniform Detection Zone - Elimination of Deep Nulls - Precise Target Location - Sensitivity Leveling.", "date_publication": "July 2005", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2005.1499245", "issue_date": "July 2005", "issue": "7", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8591862", "firstpage": "11"}, "keywords": ["CW radar", "FM radar", "radar detection", "security", "ultra wideband radar", "FM-CW radar", "MICROTRACK", "Southwest Microwave Inc", "buried cable sensor", "detection location", "detection patterns", "environmental conditions", "free format zoning", "interference", "intruder location", "low-power ultra wideband frequency stepped radar", "near field", "outdoor perimeter intrusion sensors", "phase code modulation", "sensitivity leveling", "target range resolution", "Cables", "Frequency", "Magnetic field measurement", "Magnetic sensors", "Radar detection", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Soil", "Testing", "Ultra wideband radar", "Ultra wideband technology", ""], "authors": ["J.

The gyro is based on a patented, planar magnetic actuator and position sensor configuration with a gyro wheel that is rotated by a multi-phase electromagnetic spin motor. The motor and actuator/sensor configurations, in addition to providing the necessary forces to suspend the spinning wheel, are amenable to fabrication using some of the developing MEMS fabrication technologies, making batch fabrication of the gyro possible. This provide the capability for high production yield in high volume through the use of batch processing, without the need for skilled hand labor, resulting in high yields, high reliability, and low cost of ownership. The gyro concept is described in detail. The high-speed rotation of the wheel, somewhat smaller than a dime, can produce an angular momentum much larger than that of the Coriolis force based MEMS gyros now receiving intensive development, and is expected to provide considerably higher performance than currently available from this class of instrument. Two axes of angular rate information and three axes of acceleration information are provided by the control loops that center the wheel within the case.

The findings of the Volpe report suggest, among other things, that systems and procedures to monitor, report, and locate unintentional interference should be implemented or utilized in any application for which loss of GPS is not tolerable. This paper discussed the use of the GPS anomaly monitoring equipment suite (GAMES) to detect and report anomalies in GPS. The paper also discussed systems performance via test results and demonstrated how GAMES could be used for critical infrastructure protection. Data is presented to show the different anomalies that could occur as well as demonstrating how GAMES would handle such anomalies. GAMES give the user a real-time report on how accurate GPS is, and by using the GPS interference and navigation tool (GIANT) the user can predict the accuracy and effectiveness of GPS in the near future. The combination of these tools creates a \"system\" that can be used to monitor and evaluate the GPS environment and determine impacts on GPS-aided applications. Taking the application one step further, General Dynamics has developed the GPS interference location system (GELS) that ties directly to GAMES. When GAMES detects an anomaly, GILS begins to search for the interference(s) source and passes the collected data to the Web server where the location is computed and reported. This sensor will be described and test results will be presented to demonstrate the applicability and use for commercial as well as military use. By implementing GAMES, GILS, and GIANT, the question behind GPS reliability is a thing of the past, which will allow for increased use and reliance upon GPS. The knowledge gained from the development and application of these tools is one of the fundamental building blocks for this effort. This project developed a proof-of-conce- pt that quantified the capability realized from being able to both detect and locate sources of interference during a GPS anomaly or interference event. This includes determining the benefits of interference identification for a variety of critical civil applications, and providing insights to help mitigate potential adverse impacts.

In fact, data communications support the pilot in all phases of the flight: flight planning, pre-flight, departure, en route, transition, approach, landing, and rollout as well as for a missed approach. The Internet is being used to perform flight planning activities, and the mobile communications available today support Internet access en route to the departure airfield.

The location of other aircraft is available to the pilot and ATC system through automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and traffic information service-broadcast (TIS-B) applications that transmit the location of other aircraft in the vicinity. Other aircraft locations are used to forecast potential conflicts and, thus, enhance flight safety.

RTCA SC-200 is presently considering the guidance document for IMA. All of the functionality that IMA offers can be achieved through a conventional federated architecture; however, the cost, size, and weight penalties of the federated solution make it economically infeasible. IMA is seen as the way forward. It is assuming greater importance as the aircraft industry transitions to commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology with its attendant obsolescence and reliability concerns. IMA may be one of the most cost-effective ways by which rapid obsolescence can be managed. Ironically, this move to COTS is also the greatest threat to IMA systems. IMA achieves reductions in size, cost, and weight by providing a set of flexible hardware and software resources that can be statically or dynamically mapped to a set of required avionics functional capabilities. This introduces a number of new complexities such as mixed criticalities and reconfiguration. We do not address these issues herein. Rather we discuss the mechanisms by which electronics degrades and how a classical safety assessment of a reconfigurable IMA system can be ified by this degradation. We argue that, with the advent of COTS, it is no longer justifiable to consider that electronics has an effectively constant failure rate. Physical considerations suggest that electronics failure occurs when environmental and operating stress causes the accumulation of damage to the underlying structures to exceed the threshold strength of the constituent materials and interfaces.

The Rolling Radar concept evolved from the need to design and build a large rotating 3D radar as an alternative to multifaceted fixed radar installations, or large, expensive rotating radar systems. However, the physical act of rotating massive structures weighing many tons introduces a host of load bearing and other mechanical reliability problems. An alternative design needed to be conceptualized. The new concept places the radar array inside a large wheel attached to an axle. A smaller wheel affixed to the axle's other end provides support when both wheels simultaneously roll along electrified concentric rails in order to scan 360 degrees. The array wheel propels itself via a simple gravity drive consisting of a magnetic carriage that rides an electromagnetic rail around the inside circumference of the large array wheel. Displacement of its own weight causes the wheel (and the entire axle) to roll around the railed track with no visible external means of motion. The Rolling Radar achieves its initial objective - to improve mechanical reliability - because the array wheel is self-supporting, which eliminates the need for a large support structure and bearing. There is also no need for traditional electrical slip rings, rotating fluid couplers, motors or gearboxes. With fewer moving parts (compared with conventional rotating radars), reliability is increased and life cycle costs are reduced. Another important benefit is the Rolling Radar's electronic look back capability, and the ability to achieve higher spatial resolution than standard 3D radar. This occurs because the act of rolling about its axis and simultaneously rotating about a circumference sweeps an area larger than the array's physical aperture. The effect is similar to spotlight-mode synthetic aperture radar (SAR), a technique commonly used to produce high-resolution radar maps. The Rolling Radar concept was initially developed to address reliability, life cycle cost, and weight. Although still in the concept development phase, the Rolling Radar shows great promise of increasing functionality while improving resolution and- reliability, and in its simplicity of design. Both the reliability and performance gains are in the process of being evaluated.", "date_publication": "Sept. 2005", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2005.1514770", "issue_date": "Sept. 2005", "issue": "9", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8583635", "firstpage": "18"}, "keywords": ["axles", "radar equipment", "reliability", "wheels", "Rolling Radar", "axles", "high-resolution radar maps", "machine components", "mechanical reliability", "radar arrays", "radar equipment", "rotating 3D radar", "wheels", "Axles", "Costs", "Couplers", "Electromagnetic launching", "Gravity", "Radar tracking", "Rails", "Railway electrification", "Synthetic aperture radar", "Wheels", ""], "authors": ["B.

The principle of jet propulsion seems to work perfectly; jet engines can accelerate a rocket up to an incredible speed of 11 km/sec. Looks like there is nothing left to desire. However, from the physical point of view, 11 km/sec is not such a large value compared, for instance, to the speed of light. Would it be possible to attain half of that speed using gas jets? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Nevertheless, that is not the end of the story. The purpose of this article is to show that it is still possible to use the same principle to remove limitations on attainable speed if instead of gas jets, we employ ultrafast electron beams. The basic idea of our construction was inspired by the paper by H. Morgan (ibid., vol. 13, pp. 5-10, 1998). In that article he experimentally refuted the common premise that nothing can go faster than light and gave some theoretical arguments supporting his experimental data.

This necessitated the use of electroluminescent (EL) display technology to replace the analog cathode ray tube display currently used in the system. Because of the prohibitively high cost of aircraft wiring modifications, the replacement display was required to be completely form, fit, and functionally equivalent to its replacement. The form, fit, and functional equivalency requirement imposed the following system constraints: (1) power consumption of less than 10 Watts; (2) the need to maintain the same stroke-deflection current electrical interface; and (3) the need to meet the maintenance and repair budget of the existing display unit. Additional requirements included night-vision compatibility and full sunlight readability. The display was also required to be MIL-STD-1553 Remote Terminal communication capable.

The second postulate as stated by Einstein does not deserve the status of a postulate, as it is at once overly restrictive and ultimately phenomenological-the nature of c is based on experimental measurement rather than on analysis of first principles. The radiation continuum model's (RCM) modified second postulate, however, says nothing about the actual propagation of EM energy, but only of the relative speed with which it must interact with matter to be detected. Utilizing this modified light principle we obtain an intuitive Galilean form invariance for Maxwell's equations.

When the system is set in motion, the contrasts in the properties of the media result in an apparent deflection of the light.

The issues are limited to two applications: explosion safety concerns in gasoline fueled automotive vehicles and explosion safety in jet fueled jet aircraft. In general, we concluded that flammable mixtures, under certain conditions, may exist in an empty fuel tank containing residual fuel, at ambient temperatures ranging from -51\u00b0C (-60\u00b0F) through 93\u00b0C (200\u00b0F), at or below atmospheric pressure. However, in the case of a gasoline automotive fuel tank, at normal ambient temperatures above -18\u00b0C (0\u00b0F), it is absolutely certain that the fuel tank head space contains an over-rich mixture, which cannot explode, unless the automotive fuel tank is completely drained of liquid fuel. Further, in the case of a fixed wing jet aircraft, a combustible mixture also does not exist in a fuel tank containing JetA type fuel at ambient temperatures below 38\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) which is about the lean limit flash point for commercial jet fuel at sea level. Nevertheless, this study identified six highly unlikely, but rationally possible critical conditions which can occur in a combination which may permit a combustible mixture to exist within a jet aircraft fuel tank and pose a potential hazard.

In the past the problems with the alignment of the Hubble's optics were blamed on the manufacturers of it's optical components. The hastily set investigation concluded that the problem is a spherical aberration of the primary mirror (the primary mirror is said to be 2 microns too flat at the edges). It is suggested that the real culprit is the Parker Effect. Since the time of Galileo Galilei, all telescopes were built, aligned, and used on the Earth's surface.

With the onset of Versa Modular Eurocard (VME) Extensions for Instrumentation (VXI) technology into ATE, which is supposed to bring about the promise of interchangeable instrument components. ATE customers are forced to contend with system integration and software issues. One way the ATE customer can combat these problems is to have a separate Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) organization employ rigorous methodologies to evaluate the correctness and quality of the ATE product throughout its life cycle. IV&V is a systems engineering process where verification determines if the ATE meets its specifications, and validation determines if the ATE performs to the customer's expectations. IV&V has the highest potential payoff of assuring a safe and reliable system if it is initiated at the beginning of the acquisition life cycle and continued throughout the acceptance of the system. It is illustrated that IV&V effects are more pronounced when IV&V activities begin early in the software development life cycle, but later application of IV&V is still deemed to have a significant impact. IV&V is an effective technique to reducing costs, schedule, and performance risks on the development of complex ATE, and a \u201ctool\u201d to efficiently and effectively manage ATE development risks.

IAS are intended either to deter the potential intruder or detect and give warning of an intruder directly or indirectly to the police. Unfortunately the false alarm rate, at over 90%, is so high that it leads to ineffectual use of police resources and calls into question the ability of IAS to perform effectively either as a deterrent or detector. To try and improve the situation the Police Forces in the UK have in conjunction with the alarm industry, over the past few years, implemented special measures in an attempt to reduce the number of false alarms and improve the effectiveness of the systems. However, from a study of available data on the deterrent effect of alarm systems, the national statistics for all alarm call types, the numbers of arrests arising from the calls, etc., this paper concludes that IAS on their own are not an effective police crime prevention measure.

The LightSAR will utilize emerging technology to reduce mass and life-cycle costs for a mission to acquire SAR data for Earth science and civilian applications and to establish commercial utility. LightSAR is sponsored by NASA and industry partners. The use of IFSAR to measure elevation is one of the most powerful and practical applications of radar. A properly equipped spaceborne IFSAR system can produce a highly accurate global digital elevation map, including cloud-covered areas, in significantly less time and at significantly lower cost than other systems. For accurate topography over a large area, the interferometric measurements can be performed simultaneously in physically separate receive systems. Since LightSAR offers important benefits to both the science community and US industry, an innovative government-industry teaming approach is being explored, with industry sharing the cost of developing LightSAR in return for commercial rights to its data and operational responsibility. LightSAR will enable mapping of surface change. The instrument's high-resolution mapping, along with its quad polarization, dual polarization, interferometric and ScanSAR modes will enable continuous monitoring of natural hazards, Earth's surface deformation, surface vegetation change, and ocean mesoscale features to provide commercially viable and scientifically valuable data products.

Production of this initial member of the \u03bcSCIRAS product family begins this year to support applications including guided artillery shells, technology insertion to decrease missile costs, navigation of remotely-piloted vehicles, dismounted soldier location devices and other navigation aids. The small size of this silicon multisensor and its ability to measure both angular rotation rate and linear acceleration provides a useful advantage in product packaging, cost, size, and system testing. The \u03bcSCIRAS Inertial Sensor Assembly (ISA) is housed in a 2 cubic inch package weighing less than 5 ounces (140 grams) requires less than 0.8 Watts of power. Continuing development will lead to greatly improved performance on the order of 1 deg/hr at low prices in high-volume production.", "date_publication": "Nov. 1998", "doi": "10.1109/62.730613", "issue_date": "Nov. 1998", "issue": "11", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "6093238", "firstpage": "17"}, "keywords": ["acceleration measurement", "angular measurement", "electric sensing devices", "elemental semiconductors", "inertial navigation", "microsensors", "military equipment", "missile guidance", "silicon", "/spl mu/SCIRAS", "MEMS", "Si", "acceleration bias", "angular rotation rate", "bulk micromachining", "dismounted soldier location devices", "guidance applications", "guided artillery shells", "high-volume production", "inertial acceleration sensor", "inertial measurement unit", "inertial rate sensor", "inertial sensor assembly", "linear acceleration", "missile costs", "price/performance ratio", "product packaging", "rate bias", "remotely-piloted vehicles", "sensor design", "system testing", "tactical grade navigation", "Acceleration", "Costs", "Life estimation", "Measurement units", "Micromechanical devices", "Navigation", "Packaging", "Production", "Silicon", "Testing", ""], "authors": ["R.

Yet this aspect of relativity has never been tested directly, due to the negligible size of the effect when applied to most situations. However, as the Earth orbits the Sun, any two stars located out of the plane of the ecliptic will appear to change their angle of separation as viewed during three-month intervals. This is due to the fact that at one instant the motion of the Earth lies in the same direction as a line joining the two stars, while three months later the Earth's motion is perpendicular to that line. At a velocity of 30 km/sec, the expected length contraction would be approximately 18 micro-arcseconds (\u03bcas) per degree of separation. The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) promises a resolution of /spl plusmn/1 \u03bcas in a field of view of one degree.

Therefore, grayscale morphological filters have been widely used to enhance and detect the infrared small target, but it is rarely applied to the domain of building target enhancement in dense urban sites. Additionally, its ability to build target enhancements is weak. If the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) of the image is low or the simarilty-pattem of the image is high or the image has been contaminated by heavy structured clutters, the traditional grayscale morphological filter may decrease image quality, leading to the loss of target and an increase in false alarms.

Exploiting the structure of the MTT problem: the high-dimensional maximization in DP-TBD can be solved suboptimally in a cheaper but accurate way by using the inherent structure of the tracking model [6]. When targets are clustered into well-separated groups, there is no measurement ambiguity between distant targets; therefore, the target groups can be treated independently. This idea has already been used in particle filter-based MTT methods [6-8] to enhance the sampling efficiency, but it is an unexplored area for DP-TBD. In [11], we showed that, by incorporating this idea into DP-TBD, the high-dimensional maximization can be broken down to several maximizations of lower dimension; thus, the computational cost is significantly reduced. Targets in the same cluster are still considered jointly, so the tracking performance is resilient to target interference when targets are in close proximity. 2. Generalized detection procedure: existing DP-TBD algorithms all use the same detection procedure: after DP integration, the single-target or multitarget state with the global maximum merit is selected and tested against a detection threshold. If the global maximum merit exceeds the threshold, the estimated trajectory is declared and recovered; otherwise the null hypothesis of no target is accepted. In [11], motivated by our analysis of the single-target DP merit function, a generalized detection procedure is developed. A key advantage of this detection procedure is that it requires only a single-target state DP integration without regard for how many targets exist. After the single-target DP integration, not only the global maximum but also every merit is tested against the detection threshold. All the exceeded elements are retained to form an estimation candidate group from which the partitions of the estimated multitarget state, i.e., individual target- states, will be extracted recursively in the subsequent processing. The estimated number of targets is then the number of the extracted individual target states. As a result, the dimension of the multitarget state no longer needs to be predetermined during the DP implementation as in existing algorithms.

Similarly, \u201centerprise\u201d is described as a: \u201cgoal-directed complex system of resources -human, information, financial, and physical-and activities, usually a significant operational scope, complication, risk, and duration\u201d [2], However, the necessities of today's market governed by intense competition, globalizations, and battles among supply chains, have changed the focus on how an enterprise conducts its business. Enterprises are gradually moving on from operating as a stand-alone entity to producing goods and services through a network of independent or semi-independent organizations [3]. As a result, enterprises are becoming extended network-based organisms able to operate in extremely complex environments [4]. In order to capture the dynamic nature of such entities, existing approaches can be combined to introduce an Extended Enterprise System (EES) as \u201ca complex network of distinctive yet distributed and interdependent organizational systems that are connected in an autonomic way to achieve objectives beyond reaching capacities of each\u201d [5]. The type of interactions among constituent systems of such a network might be defined based on hierarchy, collaboration, coordination, or a combinatorial form. Regardless of the interconnectivity rules and forms that results in an increased flexibility and adaptability, an EES is not devoid of being susceptible to sudden, unforeseen vulnerability that can put it in a position of great risk through astronomical financial losses and a steep decline in its overall market share, thereby leading to the loss in its competitive advant- ge.

Furthermore, the boundaries for evaluation and management of risks associated with an EES are inherited from a plethora of intra- as well as inter-organizational relationships [6,7] that stretches well beyond those associated with its enterprise-centric counterparts, and therefore warrants a great deal of attention from policy-makers as a part of designing a well-structured risk mitigation strategy.

This proposed a classification scheme for the right context of the Agile Development Cycle that was identified to be the main principle of agile development. Prior work about the context of agile software development [5,7, 8] was taken as the basis. Interviews in system developing companies were used to investigate the differences between context of agile software and systems development (hardware systems). It was found that the nature of the system is not only the main difference between the two domains but also the main driver for the right context of the Agile Development Cycle. In contrast to software, hardware systems that have to be produced physically often are difficult to be developed in small cyclic steps. Only if prototyping, testing, and implementing changes can be done quickly and cheaply, this principle is feasible. The system should not be safety-critical as well. Another requirement for feasibility is the willingness of customer to support this kind of development. On the other hand, some factors were identified to drive the demand for agility, like market dynamism, level of innovation, and rate of change. Therefore the context of Agile Systems Engineering was classified into the two dimensions: feasibility and demand. Some company examples were given to describe the different situations in this classification scheme. By using the factors one company can be classified within the scheme. So we find if the Agile Development Cycle can be put into the right context.

The fundamental difference between ONRS and traditional netted radar systems is that ONRS is capable of operating as monostatic radars and multistatic radars simultaneously, to maximally increase the number of target echoes and thus to achieve much better radar performance through target information fusion processing. It has been further illustrated that the application of ONRS will not only significantly improve radar performance in target detection, measurement, and recognition, but also greatly enhance radar capabilities in countering anti-radar techniques such as ARM, high-speed highly-maneuvering targets, stealth targets, and electronic countermeasures. The key technologies and challenges for implementing ONRS have been identified as orthogonal coding signal design, interference rejection, overcoming Doppler shift effect, improving search efficiency, and optimizing ONRS configuration. An ONRS can be conveniently constructed from multiple slightly-modified monostatic radars, which renders the real-time formulation of m Ad-Hoc ONRS possible.

Adapting a commercial equilibrium point requires compromise between commercial best practices and MIL standards. Emulating insurance is also an alternative which may require a warranty through the early-failure period. Dividing capability among multiple satellites and biasing complexity to the ground segment enables incremental control of on-orbit capacity. 2) The second theme is the development of program documentation in advance of system acquisition. Key documents would allow for government oversight in design, manufacturing, and test. 3) The third theme dealt with developmental items. It is important for early identification of developmental items through an equipment qualification status review and to treat developmental items differently. Including a small amount of developmental scope is possible in an overall fixed-price contract, though a challenge is to ensure that FAR Part 12 allows for this small amount of development. Mutually agreed pre-defined categorization methods and a test plan will mitigate risks. Long lead developments need to be completed prior to the start of a program, however selected flight qualification activities may be conducted in parallel with system acquisition. 4) Finally, the theme of migrating toward a commercial equilibrium point is accelerated by standardizing a large portion of the spacecraft and utilizing modular payloads. Developing a hardware specification prior to the official program start and implementing as many threshold and objective requirements helps to mitigate requirements creep. Bridging the gap between commercial and complex government aerospace systems is possible by executing contracts with a specification.

The following problems have been addressed and solved [26]-[28], [31]: By using broadcast signals at different carrier frequencies, the target Doppler shift is different, and the proposed method takes this into account. By using time-varying waveforms (signals of opportunity, i.e., FM, DAB, DVB-T, or pseudonoise) in the range correlation, a time-varying result is achieved. If this becomes an issue, it should be countered by increasing the range correlation time. This might be achieved either by increasing the total CPI or by keeping the CPI constant and reducing the Doppler resolution. Combining multiple bands results in cochannel correlation, as well as cross-channel correlation. While only the former is sought, it is shown that the cross terms may be neglected due to their correlation properties with respect to each other. This is also helped by their destructive frequency component from the demodulation. Even though good individual correlation performances are achieved for single channels or bands, summing the correlation contributions for the different channels or bands might cause an out-of-phase summation that modulates the range correlation peak in a way that may cause erroneous range estimates to be made. The algorithm estimates a phase correction term that, once applied, makes all contributions in phase; thus, erroneous range estimates, as well as destructive summing of target responses, are avoided.", "date_publication": "Oct. 2012", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2012.6373908", "issue_date": "Oct. 2012", "issue": "10", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "13167650", "firstpage": "16"}, "keywords": ["Doppler radar", "passive radar", "radar signal processing", "Doppler resolution", "HRR approaches", "broadcast channels", "correlation contributions", "integration times", "mathematical processing scheme", "multiband passive bistatic radar processing", "Bistatic radar", "Digital video broadcasting", "Passive radar", "Radar measurements", "Signal resolution", "Time frequency analysis", ""], "authors": ["Karl Erik Olsen", "Karl Woodbridge"], "citations": ["6233312", "6380821", "6888959", "7485069", "7394421", "7472073", "6809941"], "arnumber": "6373908"}, "Article 4": {"references": ["1459145", "4720985", "1459149", "790334", "4654010", "5463951", "5592986", "5960663", "4669549", "1459150", "1459151", "1459148", "5592397", "4720805", "6373910"], "details": {"title": "High range resolution multichannel DVB-T passive radar", "volume": "27", "date": "Oct. 2012", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "lastpage": "42", "pages": "37 - 42", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issn": "0885-8985", "abstract": "The exploitation of multiple DVB-T channels for a passive radar system has been considered to enhance the radar range resolution.

In view of this, in order to improve the estimation accuracy of roll and pitch biases, the non-linear Unsent Kalman Filter [16] may be a preferable method.

Framing the collision avoidance problem as a Markov decision process allows the logic to be generated using a specified encounter model and performance metrics. Past work has focused on using this framework to develop an improved collision avoidance system for non-GA aircraft. This presented results using the framework to optimize logic for lower performance GA aircraft and comparing its performance to the existing version of TCAS, as well as a simple Descend/Climb responsive logic. The results presented herein show that the optimized logic, issuing only climb, descend, and level-off advisories, was able to outperform the current version of TCAS and the Descend/Climb responsive logic against intruders that are equipped with TCAS. The optimized logic issuing 1000 feet = min advisories resulted in the best performance with respect to safety and alerting. For encounters where two GA aircraft are equipped with a collision avoidance system, the optimized logic was 3.1 times safer than TCAS for 500 feet = min advisories and 3.6 times safer for 1000 feet = min advisories. Both of the optimized methods resulted in lower probabilities of alert and reversal than TCAS and the Descend/Climb logic, which is desirable from an operational standpoint. The optimized logic that resulted in the best performance had a relatively high cost of reversing. This resulted in a very low probability of reversing for the GA aircraft, as low as zero in one case. The reversal rate for a TCAS-equipped intruder aircraft was slightly higher, but this was offset by a lower probability of strengthening advisories on the TCAS aircraft.", "date_publication": "July 2012", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2012.6328836", "issue_date": "July 2012", "issue": "7", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "13038467", "firstpage": "4"}, "keywords": ["Markov processes", "aerospace safety", "air traffic", "aircraft", "collision avoidance", "digital simulation", "probability", "Markov decision process", "TCAS-equipped intruder aircraft", "descend-climb responsive logic", "general aviation", "level-off advisories", "nonGA aircraft", "on-board general aviation aircraft", "optimized collision avoidance logic", "probability", "safety", "specified encounter model", "traffic alert and collision avoidance system", "Air traffic control", "Aircraft safety", "Collision avoidance", "Military aircraft", "Optimization", "Safety", "Simulation", "Traffic control", "Velocity control", ""], "authors": ["Thomas B.

Herein, the concept of a biologically inspired leg-based landing system has been presented. The controllers have been tested in simulation and designed to minimize the forces experienced by UAVs during the perched landing manoeuvre, which is significant considering the sensitive payloads carried by them. With accurate position control, velocity matching using a polynomial spline trajectory can be used to minimize impact with the perch. Cushioning the inside of the gripper mechanism with a material that has spring-damper properties can help reduce the impact and prevent slip and bounce on contact with the target. Estimating the kinetic energy of UAVs during the capture provides the controller with sufficient information to vary the amount of force being applied in real-time to decelerate it. By combining an adaptive bell-shaped stiffness controller and velocity matching scheme, a safe and successful perched landing manoeuvre can be accomplished. The required accuracy and high speed of operation required for this manoeuvre are limited by the performance of available actuators and the control bandwidth of the hardware.

By the 2025 timeframe aircraft operations are expected to double [1]. Well-founded concerns doubt that current air transportation systems will be able to cope with this growth, e.g., already VHF (Very High Frequency) communication capacity is expected to saturate in Europe by 2020-2025 [2]. Meeting these growing demands require systems providing flight information and processes in real-time including high flexibility. Also new security requirements are affecting the ability to move people and cargo efficiently.

These systems are required to work together to provide various station functions. To protect the lives onboard and the investment in the station, the systems and their connectivity had to be designed to continue to support critical functions after any single fault for early assembly stages, and after any two faults for later stages. Of these critical functions, attitude control was the most global, incorporating equipment from nearly all major systems. The challenge was to develop an architecture, or integration, of these systems that would achieve the specified level of fault tolerant attitude control and operate, autonomously, for the three-month unmanned periods during the assembly process. Additionally, this architecture had to maintain the desired utility of the station for each stage of the assembly process. This paper discusses the approach developed for integrating the systems such that the fault tolerance requirements were met for all stages of assembly. Some of the key integration issues are examined and the role of analysis tools are described.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that a planar plasma mirror immersed in a magnetic field can be formed with electron densities high enough to reflect X-band microwave beams. A plasma mirror performs like a metal mirror, but it is inertialess. Compared to high performance phased array systems, a plasma mirror based radar system is much simpler and is therefore more affordable. Electronic steering of microwave beams using a plasma mirror permits the use of wide instantaneous bandwidth waveforms. Potential areas of application for a plasma mirror based antenna system include ship self-defense, high-resolution radar imaging, target identification, electronic countermeasures, high data rate communications, spread spectrum links and remote sensing. As a reflector, the plasma mirror exhibits extremely low loss and the reflectivity is very nearly 100%. Since a perfectly reflecting object cannot radiate, the noise temperature contribution of the plasma mirror to the antenna temperature is likely to be small. The plasma sheet can be steered in elevation by tilting the magnetic field, and steering in azimuth may be accomplished by designating cathode initiation sites.

Space operations issues will be separated from the power generation fixation and verified by testing. Doing the developmental testing on the ground instead of in space will result in a low cost program that can be accomplished in a very short time. The concept is to build a Ground Test Installation that couples an existing 100 kW terrestrial solar cell array to a phased-array wireless power transmitter based on a subarray. Power will be transmitted over a 1-\u00bc mile range to a receiving antenna and then fed into a commercial utility power grid. The objective is to demonstrate the complete function of the Solar Power Satellites, with the primary issue being the validation of practical wireless power transmission. The key features to demonstrate are: beam control, stability, steering, efficiency, reliability, cost, and safety", "date_publication": "Jan 1996", "doi": "10.1109/62.484148", "issue_date": "Jan 1996", "issue": "1", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "5186594", "firstpage": "33"}, "keywords": ["aerospace simulation", "costing", "photovoltaic power systems", "power system analysis computing", "semiconductor device testing", "solar cell arrays", "solar cells", "solar power satellites", "space vehicle power plants", "beam control", "beam stability", "beam steering", "developmental testing", "efficiency", "enabling technologies", "environmental safety", "giant satellites", "ground test installation", "low cost program", "phased-array wireless power transmitter", "reliability", "solar cell array", "solar power satellites", "subarray", "system definition studies", "wireless power transmission", "Aerospace industry", "Costs", "Phased arrays", "Power generation", "Power transmission", "Satellites", "Solar energy", "Solar power generation", "Space technology", "System testing", ""], "authors": ["R.

The PPU must provide power to the electric thruster while maintaining compatibility with all of the spacecraft power and data systems. Inefficiencies in the power processor produce heat, which must be radiated to the environment in order to ensure reliable operation. Although PPU efficiencies are generally greater than 0.9, heat loads are often substantial. This heat must be rejected by thermal control systems which generally have specific masses of 15-30 kg/kW. PPUs also represent a large fraction of the electric propulsion system dry mass. Simplification or elimination of power processing in a propulsion system would reduce the electric propulsion system specific mass and improve the overall reliability and performance. A direct drive system would eliminate all or some of the power supplies required to operate a thruster by directly connecting the various thruster loads to the solar array. The development of concentrator solar arrays has enabled power bus voltages in excess of 300 V which is high enough for direct drive applications for Hall thrusters such as the Stationary Plasma Thruster (SPT).

An accurate circuit model of the exponential line for the PSPICE program has been developed and simulations are conveniently carried out by employing PSPICE", "date_publication": "Sep 1996", "doi": "10.1109/62.536796", "issue_date": "Sep 1996", "issue": "9", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "5396160", "firstpage": "4"}, "keywords": ["SPICE", "aircraft communication", "circuit analysis computing", "driver circuits", "equivalent circuits", "optical fibre communication", "semiconductor device models", "semiconductor lasers", "transmission line theory", "waveform analysis", "PSPICE program", "airborne system", "circuit model", "exponential transmission line", "gain switching", "gain-switched laser diode", "high speed driving", "laser diodes", "low resistive LD", "output waveform", "parasitic elements", "pattern effect", "rise edges", "trail edges", "Circuit simulation", "Diode lasers", "Distributed parameter circuits", "Impedance", "Optical pulses", "Pattern matching", "Power transmission lines", "Pulse transformers", "SPICE", "Transmission lines", ""], "authors": ["Zheng Li", "Yilcai Su", "Yueping Tang"], "citations": ["1275312"], "arnumber": "536796"}, "Article 6": {"references": [], "details": {"title": "Implementation issues impacting system designer utilization of wireless technologies", "volume": "11", "date": "Sep 1996", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "lastpage": "14", "pages": "11 - 14", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issn": "0885-8985", "abstract": "Wireless technologies provide the missing link for automating a wide spectrum of applications which previously were not computerized due to constraints of their environment.

Commercial air to air heat pumps typically exhibit a COP, coefficient of performance, of 1.5, which means they deliver 1.5 units of thermal energy for each 1.0 units of electrical energy input. It is more likely that these 'Zero Point' effects are the electrical analogue of a mechanically powered vapor compression refrigeration cycle. The electrolyzer phenomenon reported by Grotz and others, if true, is a heat pump. Another commercial example of an all electrical, non-mechanical, refrigeration cycle heat pump are the in-room refrigerators in Japanese hotels, which utilize the reverse thermoelectric effect. Readers are reminded that the so-called \u201cZero Point Effect\u201d is not producing more energy than is supplied to the systems, just that the COP mechanism is not yet understood in this case. The editor's response to the unexplained heat release during electrolysis is presented. He describes the experiment which was carried out with electrolysis currents ranging up to 75 amperes. For each temperature rise the resistance heating required more power than did the electrolysis process. The electrolysis had even delivered additional power in the fuel value of the released hydrogen, which was dissipated into the air. The authors calculated that making a gallon of such water would release the energy equivalent of 30 gallons of gasoline", "date_publication": "Apr 1994", "doi": "10.1109/62.277753", "issue_date": "Apr 1994", "issue": "4", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "4680172", "firstpage": "42"}, "keywords": ["cooling", "electrolysis", "heat pumps", "hydrogen economy", "refrigeration", "thermoelectric conversion", "Dual Polarity Control", "Hydrogen Production", "Japanese hotels", "Toby Grotz", "Zero Point Effect", "Zero Point Energy", "air to air heat pumps", "electrolysis heat", "in-room refrigerators", "refrigeration cycle heat pump", "reverse thermoelectric effect", ""], "authors": ["F.

A number of schemes are under consideration (heat engine battery, fuel cell battery, peaking battery, inner-city battery, etc.). The success of any of the approaches will be dependent on battery capabilities, i.e., power, density, life, and cost. The nickel-metal hydride system appears to be the most promising of the candidate battery chemistries. Preliminary designs and analysis have been prepared and are presented for various configurations. Initial performance characterization tests are presented.

The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is developing technology to support multimode radar requirements. These requirements include the detection and location of moving or stationary low radar cross section targets in heavy ground clutter and the classification and/or recognition of these targets. We address these requirements with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and the integration of several enabling technologies. The test bed radar includes a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) for frequency-diverse waveform generation, a flexible wideband transceiver for bandwidth extension and frequency translation, and an open architecture signal processor with embedded wideband analog-to-digital converters for real-time acquisition and processing.

Until recently, most radar antennas were designed and tested in a clean antenna environment, i.e., there is no near field scattering from host structures or radome effects. However, these higher order effects are the matter of increasing concern with added performance demands in the ever-increasing jammer and clutter interference environments. We investigated the capabilities and limitations of currently available analysis techniques and computer codes for installed performance of airborne radar antenna systems. Then we developed an extended ray-optical technique that could predict total installed performance of airborne radar antenna systems, i.e., the near field scattering from aircraft structures and radome effects. The new analysis technique utilized a ray-tracing method in both airframe and radome simulation.

Consequently, by 1995, vehicle manufacturers turned their attention to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This redirection of EV effort was highlighted finally in 1997, at the 57th Frankfurt Motor Show, the Audi Duo parallel type hybrid was released for the domestic market as a 1998 model vehicle.

Here, two cameras are used with an overlapping field of view, which represents an installation often used in existing video surveillance applications.

Future aircraft, spacecraft and other vehicles will require greater use of these types of controls for functions that currently are allowed to fail, fail to degraded operation, or require human intervention in response to failure. Fully automated and autonomous functions will require ultra-reliable control. But ultra-reliable systems are very expensive to design and require large amounts of on-board equipment. This paper will discuss how the use of low-cost sensors with digital outputs, digitally commanded fault-tolerant actuation devices and interconnecting networks of low-cost data buses offer the promise of more affordable ultra-reliable systems. Specific technologies and concepts to be discussed include low-cost automotive and industrial data buses, \u201csmart\u201d actuation devices with integral fault masking capabilities, management of redundant sensors, and the fault detection and diagnosis of the data network. The advantages of integrating the control and distribution of electrical power with the control system will be illustrated. The design, installation, and upgrade flexibility benefits provided by an all-digital and shared network approach will be presented.

Many testers still rely on computers designed and manufactured in the early 1980's. This includes systems using embedded controllers. Year 2000 problems can surface in computer operating systems, compilers, test programs, and in embedded systems. Until the impact of the Y2K \u201cbug\u201d is addressed, the risk of test program failure is unknown in most legacy automatic test systems. Problems may include embedded controllers in proprietary designs, old operating systems, and unique test program code. This paper will address the potential problem areas in automatic testing, and suggest an approach for determining the best course of action.

When FOOCs are used in the IO-CDMA systems, the peaks of all the cross-correlation functions and all the sidelobes of any auto-correlation function are then limited to \u201c1\u201d (i.e., the minimum correlation constraint for incoherent optical processing) in fully asynchronous transmissions.

Over the past 125 years, economists have developed mainstream mathematical economics on this incorrect basis resulting in the ill-founded neoclassical Equilibrium Theory. Because of this error economic theory is fundamentally timeless. The present theory, in its canonical form, corrects the early marginalist's error by identifying utility (time-integrated pleasure) exclusively with the stream-of-consciousness attending (expected) mental and physical activity. Time is now explicit in basic theory, thereby allowing, for the first time, the substantive computer-modeling of time-dependent, small- and large-scale economic systems. Furthermore, this new approach is methodologically compatible with mainstream sociology and institutional economics, allowing increased interdisciplinary cooperation that may influence policy and thereby affect industry and markets.

Due to the attractive performance characteristics, lithium-ion batteries have been identified as the battery chemistry of choice for a number of future applications, including Mars rovers and landers. The Mars 2001 Lander (Mars Surveyor Program MSP 01) will be one of the first missions which will utilize lithium-ion technology. This application will require two lithium-ion batteries, each being 28 V (eight cells), 25 Ah and 8 kg.

To assess the viability of lithium-ion cells for these applications, a number of performance characterization tests have been performed, including: assessing the room temperature cycle life, low temperature cycle life (-20\u00b0C), rate capability as a function of temperature, pulse capability, self-discharge and storage characteristics, as well as mission profile capability.

Since \u201copen\u201d is an unclear attribute, projects eventually give in to a point solution that has no flexibility to cost effectively keep up with rapid changes in technology. The Open Systems Development Initiative (OSDI) project utilized COTS products to study the feasibility of building an open system that has plug-and-play capabilities. Lessons learned from the AV-8B Open Systems Core Avionics Requirements (OSCAR) and the F/A-18 Advanced Mission Computers and Displays (AMC&D) programs clearly indicated that understanding the underlying interfaces is crucial to keeping the system as open as possible to take advantage of the rapid changes in technology. A matrix of Key Open Standard Interfaces (KOSI), called the KOSI matrix, was developed and an applicable standard was identified for each interface. A list of non-conforming interfaces was also identified and the use of extensions or wrappers was investigated in an attempt to comply with standards. Standardization, rather than optimization of such interfaces, was considered more beneficial. It became evident that, with the exception of ruggedization, there is no difference in the use of COTS products for either commercial or military systems. Performing a KOSI analysis helped identify the key interfaces and standards, thus enabling the OSDI system to be scalable, portable and interoperable. A good KOSI matrix provides a vehicle for clear communication and helps systems integration and technology insertion to be less painful than what it is today.

An update of validation test results confirming the breakthrough in the low-Earth-orbit (LEO) cycle life of nickel-hydrogen cells containing 26% KOH electrolyte is presented. The results are part of an investigation of the effect of KOH concentration on life cycle. The cycle life of boiler plate cells was about 40000 LEO cycles compared to 3500 cycles for cells containing 31% KOH. The cycle regime was a stressful accelerated LEO, which consisted of a 27.5 min charge followed by a 17.5 min discharge (2\u00d7normal rate). The depth-of-discharge (DOD) was 80%. The cell temperature was maintained at 23\u00b0C. Results for six 48-Ah recirculation design IPV nickel-hydrogen flight battery cells currently being evaluated to validate the above findings are reported. Three of the cells contain 26% KOH (test cells), and three contain 31% KOH (control cells). They are undergoing real-time LEO cycle life testing. The 31% KOH cells failed at cycles 3729, 4165, and 11355. One of the 26% KOH cells failed at cycle 15314.

The avionics, which include flight controls, inertial attitude reference, recovery guidance, payload and data link, represent more than 80 percent of the cost of the vehicle. The key cost drivers are the payload and data link which must accommodate long stand-off range and rapid AV jinking for good survivability, day and night operation, high radio jamming conditions, and high-precision laser pointing accuracy. However, there are many RPV applications which are less demanding and can therefore take advantage of substantial cost reductions. Lockheed Research & Development Division is addressing this need by defining flexible, adaptive, avionics concepts which emphasize the nondevelopmental philosophy. One such system is the Lockheed Adaptive Modular Payload (LAMP). This system promotes use of a standard universal two-axis gimbal platform into which many different forms of imaging sensors can be installed. This concept is aimed at reconnaissance and surveillance. It is now being integrated into the future RPV programs at the Lockheed Austin Division.", "date_publication": "June 1987", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.1987.5005419", "issue_date": "June 1987", "issue": "6", "publisher": "IEEE", "firstpage": "24"}, "keywords": ["Aerospace control", "Aerospace electronics", "Airplanes", "Attitude control", "Navigation", "Payloads", ""], "authors": ["A.

The reference launch vehicles are the Space Shuttle for the attached Module and Ariane 5 for the Polar Platform. The more recently added COLUMBUS flight configuration, the Man-Tended Free Flyer (MTFF), consists of a combination of two programme elements, the Resource Module and a 2-segment Pressurized Module. It is designed to provide all required resources and services to the various payloads in a continuous microgravity environment to perform material science, fluid physics and compatible life sciences experiments. The MTFF is carried into orbit by the European launcher Ariane 5. As an option, studies of an enhanced ground based EURECA carrier as a small co-orbiting platform, launched by the Space Shuttle, will be initiated.

First, since tube reliability has a tremendous impact on system design and overall cost, if problems do occur, they are highly visible. Second, attaining high reliability is made difficult by small production runs and short delivery schedules. Finally, the now-common 10 year life specification is combined with state-of-the-art performance requirements, forcing design changes and adding risk. To meet these requirements, we emphasize certain design and manufacturing ground rules. When orbital TWT problems do occur, our experience is that they are usually caused by infant mortality, not wearout. Data based on operation in space show that with close attention to the details of design and manufacturing, reliability exceeding the 500,000 hours MTBF normally specified is achieved. Traveling Wave Tube reliability and overall performance have a tremendous impact on system design and the overall cost of a satellite. TWT reliability determines the amount of redundancy needed to meet a given satellite mission objective. Increased redundancy means increased complexity and weight of the spacecraft. The TWTs, with their Electronic Power Conditioners, also dissipate over 80% of all spacecraft power. Increased tube efficiency will therefore simplify matters all around. Because of the critical impact of tubes, if technical problems do occur, they are highly visible at the system level, where rumors of failure spread like wildfire in the fairly small space community.

These four factors are set in a systems structure which shows their inter-relationships and provides the framework for conceptualizing avionics system solutions to meet particular mission needs. Three generic mission areas are considered and an examination is made of the issues of fielding and affording the solution with specific emphasis on architecture, fusion, production, and support.", "date_publication": "Nov. 1987", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.1987.5005268", "issue_date": "Nov. 1987", "issue": "11", "publisher": "IEEE", "firstpage": "5"}, "keywords": ["Aerospace electronics", "Design engineering", "Electronic warfare", "Radar detection", "System performance", "Systems engineering and theory", ""], "authors": ["Harvey M.

In the early conceptual phase, aeronautical system designers give scant attention to designing the avionics components.

Less than comprehensive attention is given to the interacting effect avionics have with the other system components. In contrast, the designers expend a very large effort on finding the best balanced combination of airframe and propulsion components which satisfy the design objectives. This paper shows why avionics must be a co-equal member of the aeronautical system along with airframe, propulsion, and armament.

Solid-state displays, voice recognition, and artificial intelligence are just a few of the emerging technologies that will help the pilot perform his mission in the future. Early investigations involving mission analysis, sensor data, software development, and evaluations will be required to insure total integration. These new technologies will require extensive human factors research in the areas of anthropometry, displays, controls, human/computer interface, automation, and workload assessment to support the integration process. This research will help provide weapons systems that have increased survivability and reduced pilot workload. This paper addresses some of the human factors research that will be needed to help develop future cockpit systems. It also reviews the basic evolution of the crew station and some of the emerging technologies that will drive human factors research in the 1990s. In the past, crew systems were designed to provide each aircraft function with a corresponding instrument display, such as airspeed indicator, altimeter, attitude direction indicator, vertical velocity indicator, etc. The bulk of the information had to be integrated by the pilot. Present systems are in a state of transition. We are rapidly moving from individual instruments to multifunction displays. The C-17, HH-60, F-15E, B-1B, F-111D, and F-16C/D aircraft use multifunction, cathode-ray tube displays, some of which are color.

Standard integrated circuits (IC) have limitations or restrictions in size, speed, reliability, complexity and finding suitable replacements for discontinued items.

One of the key properties of quantum physics that quantum computers rely on is the ability of certain atoms or nuclei to work together as quantum bits. These computing devices are a fraction of the size of typical ICs (nanoscale). Nanoscale devices developed using quantum physics principles have unlimited potential to revolutionize the methods and design of fabricated printed circuit cards and complete systems.

This paper presents a new navigation system a \"Self-Calibrating Pseudolite Array\" (SCPA) that can provide centimeter-level, drift-free localization to multiple rovers within a local area by utilizing GPS-based transceivers deployed in a ground-based array.

Because of high visibility events such as the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 in 1988, the explosion of TWA Flight 800 in 1996, and the most recent catastrophic events of September 11, 2001, increased security measures have been put in place to protect the flying public from terrorists. The need to share and exchange information effectively and in a timely manner between airport services and systems, with other airport facilities, outside organizations and government agencies, becomes greater each day. The increased requirements defined by previous policy, threat, vulnerability, and risk assessments can be used to derive security services for NAS Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations, as well as Airport Facility (AF) operations. However, conventional solutions may not be suited to the unique needs of an airport environment and may be operationally unacceptable in some cases.

These engines and turbines run at high heat-input temperatures because their efficiency is limited by the Carnot cycle. Muscles used for propulsion by animals are not limited in efficiency by the Carnot cycle, so we see dolphins getting 3,000 miles of travel from a food quantity that contains the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline. Leaves on plants capture the energy in sunlight to extract carbon from carbon dioxide in the air, and hydrogen form water, to manufacture carbohydrates. Scientists and engineers studying these processes are amazed by the computing power and data storage required to make these processes work. For example, a tiny grape seed contains the data and structural technology required for quickly constructing the plant's fuel-producing leaves and the structures that support them. Even the stiff thorn that discourages intruders from entering the grape bush has an effective design. The data stored in the seed specifies the color of the grape plant's blossoms, commands the production of the sugar-containing fluid that goes into the grapes, and even the data content of the next-generation seeds in the globules of each grape berry.

Researchers at the Severe Storms Research Center (SSRC) of the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), Georgia Institute of Technology are attempting to detect tornado formation within severe thunderstorms occurring in the vicinity of Atlanta, Georgia, using non-radar sensors that may provide early tornado warning and provide cueing to existing National Weather Service (NWS) radars. The goal of these studies is to increase the warning time of tornado formation within the parent thunderstorm. GTRI researchers use real-time S-band Doppler weather radar data from three National Weather Service WSR-88D NEXRAD radars to complement the development of the non-radar tornado sensors. Three NWS Doppler radars provide severe weather surveillance coverage of the north Georgia area to determine if a thunderstorm contains the Doppler signature that indicates tornado formation. The radar data, displayed on a work station developed and optimized for tornado detection by the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), serves as ground truth data for the non-radar sensor development. GTRI can display cloud to ground (CG) lightning strikes, a capability provided by overlaying data from a national monitoring network onto the radar reflectivity map.

As the density and complexity of onboard avionics increases, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) environment degrades proportionately, leading to decreasing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and potential safety concerns. The coaxial cables are inherently lossy, limiting the RF signal bandwidth while adding considerable weight. To overcome these limitations, we have investigated a fiber optic communications link for aircraft that utilizes wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to support the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals (including RF) over a single optical fiber. Optical fiber has many advantages over coaxial cable, particularly lower loss, greater bandwidth, and immunity to EMI. In this paper, we demonstrate that WDM can be successfully used to transmit multiple RF signals over a single optical fiber with no appreciable signal degradation. We investigate the transmission of FM and AM analog modulated signals, as well as FSK digital modulated signals, over a fiber optic link (FOL) employing WDM. We present measurements of power loss, delay, SNR, carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR), total harmonic distortion (THD), and bit error rate (BER).

Note: this development system with today's technology is also a network-centric system. An outline of the design language under construction and the design guidelines being studied is provided. Specifically we discuss ATMS mission objectives (e.g., average yearly throughput of people and freight for a high demand scenario); ATMS sample usage scenarios (e.g., ATMS reroutes air traffic in time and space in reaction to major weather deviation along the northeast coast); and system objectives for an ATMS (e.g., timelines of a specific high volume of messages from aircraft, weather sensors, and airports). We lay out some key design decisions associated with both the development system of engineers and domain specialists and the operational ATMS. Examples of key design decisions for the engineering system are: 1) appropriate partitioning of functional/physical architectures of the engineering system; 2) appropriate degree to telecollaboration and collaboration among design/integration groups; 3) appropriate incremental delivery packages for an incremental delivery schedule of ATMS elements; and 4) appropriate levels and thrusts of the risk management program.

Critical to the successful observations was continuous availability of power from its solar arrays during sunlit periods, and from nickel-hydrogen batteries when the satellite was in the Earth's shadow. The adopted nickel-hydrogen batteries were carefully selected and tested to confirm their depth-of-discharge and operating temperature that delivered the longest life in charge/discharge cycling service. These batteries had a design life of 7 years. At 12 years after launch the Hubble batteries have delivered more charge/discharge cycles than any other batteries in low-Earth orbit. However, the Hubble batteries have been subjected to many unexpected stresses, and peculiar reductions in battery capacity have been observed. Battery replacement requires a costly trip to the Hubble Space Telescope by astronauts, so the remaining useful life of the batteries must be predicted. Already in four servicing missions, astronauts have replaced or modified optics, solar arrays, a power control unit, and various science packages. A fifth servicing mission is scheduled in 2004.

After discussing static and dynamic arms race models which are predictive, we turn to a simple non-linear arms race model which allows a transition from predictabililty to chaos. We then postulate that such a transition describes the transition from peace to war in the two party hostile competitive system being modeled by the nonlinear equations, that peace is to war in reality as determinism is to chaos in a mathematical model of that reality. Thus, escalation from peace to war through various levels of hostility may not be controllable, the ``slipping'' from peace to war may be as inadvertent as the slipping from laminar flow to turbulence as an aircraft stalls and loses control.

The impact of parasitic circuit effects have significant impact on power circuit performance. Finally, this paper looks at an example control application. The design is that of a permanent magnet motor driven actuator. The drive motor uses 270 vdc for supply voltage.

Ben Hogan in his book Power Golf states: `Reverse every natural instinct and do just the opposite of what you are inclined to do and you will probably come very close to having a perfect golf swing'. Sam Snead probably gave us a clue to success at the game when he described his swing as feeling oily, a graphic description of the smoothness of his swing. This paper describes some muscle control systems that regulate the body posture during the golf swing and a biofeedback device designed to assist golfers in learning smooth motion sequences. Smooth sequences are required to maintain the degree of coordination needed to effectively strike the ball. The sense of hearing, which is not directly required in the swing is used as the channel through which feedback is provided. Information proportional to accelerations sensed at the golfer's head is fed back through the auditory system by the use of variable amplitude and pitch. For the purposes of this paper, the muscle control systems involved in the golf swing can be considered to include two different classes of neurological and muscle systems. One of these is the muscle control of posture and stance that requires both spinal reflexes and higher cortical reflexes. The second system deals with muscle reflexes associated with keeping the head and the eyes stationary; these are primarily related to the vestibulo-ocular system.", "date_publication": "Aug. 1986", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.1986.5005178", "issue_date": "Aug. 1986", "issue": "8", "publisher": "IEEE", "firstpage": "14"}, "keywords": ["Auditory system", "Biological control systems", "Books", "Centralized control", "Control systems", "Education", "Engineering profession", "Eyes", "Muscles", "Psychology", ""], "authors": ["Thomas W.

Candidate targets are segmented from the image about the points of interest using an.algorithm that finds all regions in multi-region objects and does not require a priori intensity information. Size and gross shape features are used to determine if the segmented objects are to be classified as targets. The key to this approach is the initial hot spot extraction. The temperature dependent ratio image allows quick and confident screening of the entire field of view, so that only the regions of interest require further processing.

This article is to provide some insight into the status of high voltage for aerospace equipment and the differences between terrestial and aerospace system functions and the attendant problems. What are the basic differences between terrestial/commercial and aerospace equipment? The aerospace environment is defined as that significantly above the Earth's surface: From 5000 feet altitude to deep space. The basic differences are the constraints placed on the user vehicle (airplane, missile, or spacecraft). Constraints include: Atmospheric pressure, temperature, lifting capability, electronic requirements, and volume. Early airplanes needed only radios and mechanical pressurization instruments. Today's sophisticted airplanes require transmitters, receivers, controls, displays, and in the military case, special electronics. The addition of electronic devices has increased the electrical power demand from a few watts (for early aircraft) to well over one megawatt for special applications.

Emphasis on exploiting applications of the ultimate human resource, the mind, can be expected through the use of biocybernetics; initially to control previously manual and/or automated cockpit functions, and eventually to allow bidirectional communications.

This paper discusses the utilization of two expert systems for handling multisensor data fusion and situation assessment. In multisensor data fusion, each sensor operates over a different region of the surveillance volume asynchronously and provides different measurements. In some instances, more than one sensor may yield the same measurement but with a different measurement accuracy. In this regard, the paper describes, in layman's terms, a system block diagram for processing the autonomous sensor track files and the possible need for a ``smart'' fusion processor. This expert system is shown to manage the sensor outputs in both the temporal and spatial domains to maximize target identification confidence as well as kinematic state vector accuracy. The paper delineates the features needed by the fusion expert in order to assign a quality factor to each composite track file entry. A second expert system uses the output from fusion and other mission-related data to formulate the best picture of the surveillance volume at hand. This second expert system will show how historical data and real-time sensor data are merged for purposes of display parameters to the pilot, weapon cueing, countermeasures response management, and feedback to the fusion expert processor for individual sensor communication and data collection direction.

The tremendous computer horsepower required to accomplish this task in real-time in an airborne environment is well documented. Hardware implementation of complex algorithms traditionally has produced custom devices which accomplish a specific function on a specific data structure. Historically, this has resulted in powerful but inflexible systems incapable of adapting to the changing requirements of military missions. In an age of evolving technology, these pitfalls must be avoided by incorporating expected changes into the design of digital map systems. If they are made to accommodate a variety of cartographic data bases and allow for programmable manipulation of those bases, this new class of digital map sets can be reconfigured at the software level to meet the changing requirements of aircraft missions. This paper addresses current design concepts for such a map system on a Night Attack aircraft. The focus is on issues concerning the development and handling of existing map data products to meet current system requirements.

These devices accounted for $7 billion in U.S. sales in 1984. Their capabilities can provide the means for new or greatly improved medical procedures, and ensure greater patient safety. However, these benefits can easily be compromised if ``computer safety'' is not practiced in the design, manufacturing, testing and clinical use of these devices. Along with a trend to wider usage, the number of recalls of medical devices due to computer-related problems has approximately doubled in the last five years. ``Computer-caused'' problems are often not recognized or reported as such, resulting in an underestimation of the prevalence of this type of problem. Our study of technical factors causing problems in computerized devices revealed that software quality assurance (SQA), the quality of the ac power, and electromagnetic interference are primary factors.

Those comprehensive architectures are prerequisite for further research on fractionated spacecraft, such as cluster operations. The functional architecture specifies that there are four resource components; i.e., HBD component, DRSC component, MDP component, and LVDS component, to enable the fractionated space infrastructure to support multiple EO payloads. The physical architecture is derived by means of AHP, and the winner architecture consists of four heterogeneous modules to host the aforementioned four resource components separately. The organizational architecture is designed in such a way that each module is modeled as an agent and the fractionated system is organized through three layers; namely, the planner, allocator, and local controllers. The planner belonging to the higher level layer decomposes abstract high-level goals into cooperative tasks that satisfy temporal and resources constraints. And then the allocator from the middleware layer assigns the generated tasks to each module, which in the end accomplishes the assigned tasks with the onboard controller that belongs to the lower level layer. From both the physical and organizational perspective, the developed space infrastructure is able to self-adapt, self-optimize, and self-configure to dynamic changes in various local environmental conditions, and therefore fulfills the nontraditional requirements of long-term EO missions.", "date_publication": "Dec. 2014", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2014.130180", "issue_date": "Dec. 2014", "issue": "12", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "14867566", "firstpage": "6"}, "keywords": ["organisational aspects", "space vehicles", "AHP", "DRSC component", "HBD component", "LVDS component", "MDP component", "allocator", "components large volume data storage", "cooperative tasks", "fractionated space infrastructure", "functional architectures", "heterogeneous modules", "local controllers", "long-term Earth observation missions", "middleware layer", "mission data processor", "multiple EO payloads", "multiple data relay satellite communication component", "onboard controller", "organizational architectures", "physical architectures", "planner", "resource components", "resource constraints", "temporal constraints", "winner architecture", "Cluster approximation", "Collision avoidance", "Computer architecture", "Decision support systems", "Design methodology", "Distributed databases", "Memory", "Payloads", "Power generation", "Space vehicles", "Wireless communication", ""], "authors": ["Jing Chu", "Jian Guo", "Eberhard Gill"], "citations": ["7116833"], "arnumber": "7015508"}}, "Issue 3": {"Article 5": {"references": ["6187222", "4351849", "5471127", "199358", "199359", "790731", "4838951", "6484205", "4033800", "5446718", "4616775", "6328550", "6328839", "4526493", "960454", "4395044", "4395065"], "details": {"title": "Cold-capable, radiation-hardened SiGe BiCMOS wireline transceivers", "volume": "29", "date": "March 2014", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "lastpage": "41", "pages": "32 - 41", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issn": "0885-8985", "abstract": "Electronics in space-based systems are in the process of a paradigm shift moving from centralized, heavily shielded, temperature-controlled warm boxes to distributed, minimally shielded sensing and control nodes.

We observe trends when extracting ASCs from 2D images and study the behavior for 10 civilian vehicles using the AFRL Civilian Vehicle Data Dome. Passenger cars categorized as the sedan class tended to exhibit scattering by cylinders, horizontal edges, and horizontal dihedrals at low elevation angle (30\u00b0) but primarily showed horizontal cylinders and horizontal dihedrals for the case of high elevation angle (60\u00b0). Likewise, the dominant scatterers for the SUV class were horizontal cylinders and horizontal edges for 30\u00b0 elevation and primarily horizontal cylinders and dihedrals for 60\u00b0 elevation.

Such targets can be aircraft, ships, ground vehicles, satellites, or ballistic missiles. Nowadays, identification is mostly based on cooperative methods like the identification friend-foe (IFF) systems in the military sector or automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) for civil aircraft. However, a number of situations exist in which a cooperative identification is not possible. In conflict situations, hostile targets do not identify themselves. Knowledge of their type by NCI yields a tactical advantage. History has also shown a significant number of cases in which neutral or friendly targets have been destroyed due to their inability to identify themselves. Neutral targets usually do not share IFF codes of conflict parties, and friendly targets may turn off their IFF when performing covert operations. Operations between allied nations have also been a source of possible IFF failure. Furthermore, the desire for NCI is not limited to conflict situations.

One of the most essential uses of this capability is in disaster monitoring, where up-to-date, reliable images and data are vital for the undertaking and coordinating of rescue actions. Sensors in space are very accurate but typically have a long revisit time, and thus their use for continuous monitoring is limited. Manned aircrafts equipped with optical, infrared, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are costly, and their operation in poor weather conditions (like heavy storms) are limited due to concerns over pilot safety. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are ideal candidates for the safe and cheap surveillance and imaging of such areas. They can provide continuous monitoring at very low cost, be deployed very quickly, and pose no risk of the loss of life in the case of a platform malfunction caused by heavy weather conditions, technical problems, or human error. The disadvantage of small, unmanned platforms is that they only offer limited space for payloads and have a low electrical power supply. This lays down the conditions for the design of an airborne sensor for small- and medium-sized UAVs. The cheapest solution for UAV surveillance is the use of visual light cameras. Optical cameras are cheap, light, and require a low supply of power, but their usage is limited to the daytime and good weather conditions. The presence of heavy rain, clouds, fog, or smoke can significantly reduce their imaging distance, sometimes down to just a few meters. Far better results can be obtained using much longer electromagnetic waves. The use of far infrared (e.g. in the 10 \u03bcm region) can provide thermal information and can be used for the detection of people in both day and night conditions, but it does not provide satisfactory images of land and infrastructures.

This was proposed for the first time in the beginning of this century by Krieger et al and Griffiths et al. Because passive imaging is completely covert and relatively cheap, as it does not require its own transmitter, and the rapid growth of the computational power of processors has made it possible, the topic has attracted the attention of many research institutes. Recently, several bistatic radar experiments have been carried out using ground stationary receivers and spaceborne illuminators, and the results have shown new capabilities of SAR imaging. In most of these trials, cooperative illuminators were used and placed on satellite platforms developed by the country conducting the experiment, means that the receiver has exact a priori information about the transmitter's parameters (e.g., carrier frequency, signal parameters, chirp duration, pulse repetition frequency [PRF], etc.). To obtain a passive SAR image when the parameters are roughly known, additional techniques for signal analysis and parameter estimation have to be applied, which make the processing more sophisticated. In this article, the challenges and limitations of the PB-SAR imaging are discussed, and the differences in the signal processing chain in mono- and bistatic configurations are indicated. Finally, the recent results of real passive SAR images are presented. The results were obtained by the Warsaw University of Technology (WUT) in 2013, using their passive radar demonstrator mounted on the ground.

To do this, several alternatives have been proposed by scholars and aerospace research institutions all over the world. Among the suggestions are the RObotic GEostationary orbit Restorer (ROGER) for orbital monitoring and deorbiting [3, 4], an ion beam shepherd for contactless space debris removal [5], electrodynamic tether deorbiting [6-8], deorbiting using solar radiation force [9-11], and space robots.

These architectures range from each sensor tracking the targets and sending a state vector and covariance matrix to the fusion center to each sensor sending all measurements (targets and clutter) to the fusion center for tracking and state estimation. Choosing which architecture to use involves decisions between optimal estimation, practical use of communication bandwidth between the sensors and the fusion center, and computer resources required at either location. A comparative study of architectures in the literature has been limited to varieties of one general architecture (track-to-track fusion) [4]-[11].

The flight system communicates with TDRSS at both S-band and Ka-band and can receive within the GPS L-band for navigation waveform development and experiments.", "date_publication": "April 2013", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2013.6506824", "issue_date": "April 2013", "issue": "4", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "13474526", "firstpage": "4"}, "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "aerospace computing", "aerospace industry", "aerospace testing", "avionics", "ground support equipment", "space communication links", "CoNNeCT experiment", "GPS L-band", "ISS", "Ka-band", "NASA SCaN test bed flight experiment payload", "NASA space communication", "S-band", "STRS SDR architecture standard", "TDRSS", "flight communication system", "international space station", "navigation test bed", "navigation waveform development", "on-board networking", "reprogrammable avionic software", "routing experiment", "verified ground system", "Aerospace control", "Field programmable gate arrays", "NASA", "Payloads", "Radio frequency", "Software radio", "Space vehicles", "Telemetry", "Transceivers", ""], "authors": ["Richard C.

The design used for the experiments was implemented in an antifuse FPGA (ACTEL RT14100A). Power consumption was first estimated by simulation of the design to identify the elements that had a higher impact on the total power consumption. According to the power estimations, the more suitable power reduction techniques were identified and applied to reduce power consumption of the initial design. With this approach, the worst-case power consumption was reduced to 30% of the original power estimations by using gated clocks and redesigning small critical components with an asynchronous style. Further reduction, typically up to 16% of the original value, was possible by applying architectural modifications. These results show that important power savings are possible for FPGA designs by following the appropriate methodology. Precise estimation of the contribution of the various functional units to the total power is essential to target only those modifications that are significant from the power point of view and to avoid large redesign efforts.", "date_publication": "Dec. 2013", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2013.6693668", "issue_date": "Dec. 2013", "issue": "12", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "14030666", "firstpage": "46"}, "keywords": ["avionics", "clocks", "energy conservation", "field programmable gate arrays", "logic CAD", "low-power electronics", "power consumption", "reconfigurable architectures", "ACTEL RT14100A", "antifuse FPGA design", "architectural modifications", "critical components redesigning", "element identification", "functional units", "gated clocks", "low-power design techniques", "power consumption estimation", "power reduction technique", "power savings", "space application", "worst case power consumption reduction", "Aerospace electronics", "Circuit synthesis", "Design methodology", "Digital systems", "Lower power electronics", "Power consumption", ""], "authors": ["Luis Mengibar-Pozo", "Michael G.

The compound interference (in decibels) with the terrestrial terminal was found to follow the Gaussian distribution. The results showed that there is visibility of the onboard networks in terms of noise floor increase, especially for GSM-1800 MHz networks, and the output of the base station should be adjusted around 0 dBm, if we want to avoid using an extra RF shielding in the aircraft cabin.

DRAM technology is very fast, reliable, and provides a very high data rate, but needs power back up to retain data and tends to become very inefficient (on a watt/bit scale) with increasing capacity. This is why flash technology has been considered for replacing the well-established DRAMs. NAND flash is currently the most suitable solution for nonvolatile storage in embedded applications and it is gaining access to in safety critical applications, thanks to their high storage density, low power, low cost, and high data throughput. However, NAND flash research and literature in the safety-critical environment is not as established as in the commercial applications. As a matter of fact, for the specific case of space applications, NAND flash is struggling to keep pace with those advances for multiple reasons. This article provides an overview of these reasons. We discussed the most relevant design aspects to address when dealing with NAND flash memory for the critical space environment. Furthermore, the Sentinel-2 practical example lets the reader experience the advantages of adopting a NAND flash-based SSMM as opposed to a SDRAM-based device.

Since their initial employment, OTHR systems have significantly improved in abilities to detect and track TOIs such as aircraft, ballistic and cruise missiles, and ships [2]. The refraction utilized by OTHR systems occurs on the D-, E-, and F-layers of the ionosphere. Unfortunately, ionospheric refractivity (and hence OTHR fidelity) greatly depends upon environmental conditions including (but not limited to): time of day, sunspot activity, ground clutter, and season of the year. OTHR systems must dynamically shift transmission frequencies to account for these environmental conditions, resulting in wide variations in performance, particularly against small/slow targets. Unfortunately, during \u201cnight, the D-layer disappears, [and] the E and F regions experience a substantial decrease in ionization,\u201d thereby decreasing the ability of the ionosphere to refract HF signals [2]. The effect of ionosphere environmental conditions on OTHR performance presents unique challenges in identifying preferred radar siting location strategies. Despite these limitations, OTHR systems present potential opportunities to dramatically improve surveillance capabilities.

The light from a reference marker fixed inside of the spacecraft enters each camera's field of view through the auxiliary optical path and then is imaged on the CCD sensor, providing virtual and infinite reference points for each camera. The image position of the reference marker varies with the attitude change of the camera, and the attitude transformation matrix can be computed through the image change of the reference marker. Therefore, if camera attitude disturbances occur, the matrix can be used to compensate for camera attitude disturbances. The experimental results show that the auxiliary optical path design is feasible and the light from the reference marker can be reflected into the view of each camera. The proposed camera attitude disturbances correction method can be used to eliminate camera attitude disturbances for improving 3D measurement accuracy. However, it is certain that the complexity of the system is increased compared with systems without an auxiliary optical path, and complexity is a compromise with accuracy. Besides, camera attitude disturbances for binocular vision in RVD are complex and affected by many factors. We only dealt with the problem from a geometric view and still have much work to do. For example, the auxiliary optical path will introduce more error sources that need further study.

Open-loop optimal solutions were achieved with a new technique,based on using mathematical methods, such as calculus of variation and the GA-PSO optimization algorithm. This novel method could overcome difficulties of the usual optimal control methods. The TS approach developed closed-loop guidance that dealt with the novel neural-fuzzy training algorithm based on open-loop optimal trajectories to achieve closed-loop guidance. By feed forwarding the optimal control as a nominal optimum trajectory plus deviation, closed-loop optimal control can be generated. On the other hand, (TS) fuzzy logic needs storing nominal optimal trajectories to train the system. As discussed, the responses of the optimal closed-loop guidance were achieved, and the robustness of closed-loop policies against noises and/or disturbances was studied. However, it was difficult to obtain closed-loop solutions when the other methods, such as dynamic programming or analytical methods, were considered. The case mentioned is an important innovative idea for autonomous MAVs, whose results are important for further developments of Samarai monocopter. The results of this work demonstrated that the closed-loop optimal responses based on TS fuzzy logic methods can damp disturbances for minimum time criterion. However, the result of fuzzy logic is perfectly suitable, where higher noises were applied. Therefore, it can be concluded that fuzzy logic was robust and efficient in eliminating perturbations.

The technology determines the two-way delay of the radar pulse echo from the Earth's surface to a very high precision (to less than a nanosecond). The instrument is also able to measure the power and the shape of the reflected radar pulses. Since the first dedicated altimeter was launched on the Seasat platform in 1978, satellite altimetry has experienced incredible and continuous development as new sensors have been designed and have become operational. The accuracy in range measurements gradually reached values that have produced an extraordinary increase in our knowledge of many aspects of ocean and ice dynamics and variability. Mainly, the evolution of the altimeter transmitter is marked by improvements in pulse compression techniques that have substantially reduced peak power requirements, as reported in [1] and [2], for example. The altimeter missions considered in this paper operate at Ku-band. The choice of frequency is constrained by both the system and the operational requirements. Since a narrow transmitted pulse is required to achieve reasonable range precision, high-frequency operation supports both the large receiver bandwidth and the narrow antenna beamwidth requirements.

With the extensive application and popularization of GPS, it makes remarkable contributions to scientific applications and engineering services. Currently, two emerging constellations (BDS, Galileo) as well as the recovery of GLONASS, the multiconstellation GNSS is undergoing dramatic development with better performance. Once the four systems are fully deployed, about 120 satellites will be available for GNSS users [1]. If all the visible satellites are used for position resolving, it will burden the receiver processor significantly. Meanwhile, there may be larger pseudorange measurement errors when the satellites have low elevation for the transmission of ionospheric and tropospheric delay. In addition, we cannot neglect simultaneous multiple outliers in multiconstellation GNSS compared with conventional RAIM. With respect to the weighted matrix factor in WLS, i.e., the uncertainty of the pseudorange measurements, estimation error is often used for weighted matrix estimation, without concerning real-time transmission error and signal quality, which somewhat enlarges the positioning accuracy.

Test Programs are usually written by specifying the instruments to be used in the ATE and the sequence of the setup and measurement parameters for these instruments. Reuse of test program software on other ATE is usually not possible without rewriting, revalidating and re-releasing the programs. This paper describes an implementation of a test program software development system and a standard of software runtime architecture used in our factories. The object-oriented development environment and its associated class libraries allow test programs to be written without knowledge of the ATE on which they will be run. Two main principles guided the design: the software architecture was based on recognized formal and industry standards; and our implementation used commercial off-the-shelf software products when possible. Emerging standards such as the IEEE-1226 (ABBET) as well as defacto industry standards including VXI Plug and Play have made our implementation possible. The current draft of the ABBET and P&P standards do not promote this instrument independence, but it is hoped that this will be added as the standards mature. Three immediate benefits are: cost savings that result from reusing validated test programs; cycle time reductions that result from concurrently developing test program software and ATE; and software defect reductions that result from using proven software", "date_publication": "Jun 1997", "doi": "10.1109/62.587055", "issue_date": "Jun 1997", "issue": "6", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "5612142", "firstpage": "29"}, "keywords": ["CAD", "automatic test equipment", "software reusability", "standards", "systems re-engineering", "ABBET", "ATE", "Automatic Test Equipment", "IEEE-1226", "VXI Plug and Play", "cost savings", "cycle time reduction", "factory", "industry standards", "object-oriented development environment", "off-the-shelf software products", "reusable independent test programs", "software defect reduction", "software runtime architecture", "test program software", "test program software development", "test sequences", "validated test programs", "Automatic control", "Automatic test equipment", "Automatic testing", "Instruments", "Programming", "Runtime", "Software standards", "Software testing", "Standards development", "System testing", ""], "authors": ["B.

The source-detector coupler is not part of the Sagnac interferometer, and serves solely to direct light from the interferometer into the output photodetector. Many commercial laser diodes incorporate a back-facet photodetector to monitor laser intensity. The signal returned from the Sagnac traverses the laser, and can be detected at this photodetector. The gyro signal can be distinguished from the laser signal by the bias modulation applied in the interferometer. Configuring a gyro in this manner eliminates a directional coupler and the separate photodetector, as well as up to two fiber splices in an all-fiber gyroscope.

Relevant data, with respect to their intrusion activities, were recorded continuously. We have worked out a hypothesis on typical attacker behavior based on experiences from this and other similar experiments. The hypothesis suggests that the attacking process can be split into three phases: the learning phase, the standard attack phase and the innovative attack phase. The probability for successful attacks during the learning phase is expected to be small and, if a breach occurs, it is rather a result of pure luck than deliberate action. During the standard attack phase, this probability is considerably higher, whereas it decreases again in the innovative attack phase. The collected data indicates that the breaches during the standard attack phase are statistically equivalent.

A world that, ten years ago, was unaware of the concept can now witness approximately 200 fuel cell units operating in 15 countries. Energy planners and decision makers are becoming aware that, in addition to a continual increase in installations, the reliability of early commercial units is outstanding and the cost is dropping. They have begun to ask whether fuel cells might fit into their future. While the fuel cell concept is simple, determining which type of fuel cell to consider may prove taxing. The multiplicity of fuel cells and their development programs, coupled with the amount of subject material and claims-versus-reality, may seem overwhelming. Fuel cell commercialization activities in North America are the focus of five manufacturers that are developing four types [fuel cells are typed by electrolyte: the 200\u00b0C phosphoric acid (PAFC); the 80\u00b0C proton exchange membrane (PEM); the 650\u00b0C molten carbonate (MCFC); and the 1,000\u00b0C solid oxide (SOFC) fuel cells]. Each fuel cell promises the attractive combination of fairly high efficiency and superior environmental performance compared to the presently available fossil-fueled electric generation technologies. As a result, fuel cells are particularly easy to site. There are additional advantages such as: excellent availability; electrical VAR control; quick ramp rate; remote/unattended operation; and redundancy when multiple units are installed. After earlier success in space, fuel cells are being applied to the commercial sector as on-site cogeneration units mostly fueled by natural gas. They are being considered for larger distributed generators (natural gas) and for vehicular power plants (methanol)", "date_publication": "Mar 1997", "doi": "10.1109/62.579205", "issue_date": "Mar 1997", "issue": "3", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "5530360", "firstpage": "23"}, "keywords": ["cost-benefit analysis", "economics", "fuel cell power plants", "fuel cells", "power system planning", "SOFC", "availability", "commercialization", "costs", "efficiency", "environmental performance", "fuel cells", "molten carbonate cell", "on-site cogeneration units", "phosphoric acid cell", "proton exchange membrane", "reliability", "Commercialization", "Costs", "Fuel cells", "Heating", "Manufacturing", "Natural gas", "North America", "Power generation", "Protons", "Space technology", ""], "authors": ["J.

Also known as \u201cleaky cable\u201d and \u201cguided radar\u201d sensors, the technology uses buried leaky coaxial cables to establish a terrain-following covert detection zone. By operating in the Very High Frequency (VHF) band, these sensors operate under all-weather conditions and have superior detection and false/nuisance alarm performance compared to other technologies. In addition, the technology has been independently evaluated as having the lowest available vulnerabilities to defeat. In 1995, Senstar Corporation announced, in a precursor to this paper, the development of a new generation of ported coaxial cable sensors. This new generation featured the availability of a novel leaky cable design that combines both transmit and receive elements in a single jacketed cable for ease of installation. A new concept for the sensor was also presented, that results in significant performance improvements, and offers a highly modular system architecture for ease of application.

The research on the singly- and doubly-fed induction machines has focused on VSCF for wind power generation, whereas that on switched reluctance machines has been directly studied as a VSCF technology in aircraft systems. Results obtained so far favor the switched reluctance machine over the induction machine. Based on the foregoing comparative review, it is recommended that the induction machine be fully investigated as a VSCF drive for aircraft systems.

Use of a CPSS has a number of advantages. In particular, it allows the spacecraft to increase power supply level and service life as well as to decrease the spacecraft mass and cost. However, it sets new physical and technical problems associated with long distance power transmission and requires some changes in spacecraft structure and concepts. The feasibility study of CPSS development and use has to rely on existing or firmly forecastable technologies.

The industrial developers of offshore hydrocarbon reserves in ice infested regions have an urgent requirement for the long range detection and tracking of icebergs from their production platforms.

Thermionics offers system compactness via modest efficiency at high heat rejection temperatures, and AMTEC offers high efficiency at modest heat rejection temperature. From a thermal viewpoint, the two are ideally suited for cascaded power conversion: thermionic heat rejection and AMTEC heat source temperatures are essentially the same. In addition to realizing conversion efficiencies potentially as high as 35-40% such a cascade offers the following perceived benefits: Survivability-capable of operation in the Van Allen belts; Simplicity-static conversion, no moving parts; Long lifetime-no inherent life-limiting mechanisms identified; Technology readiness-Large thermionic database; AMTEC efficiencies of 18% currently being demonstrated, with more growth potential available; and Technology growth-applicable to both solar thermal and reactor-based nuclear space power systems.

What is needed is a process that integrates these initiatives while ensuring the overall system objectives are achieved. An Open Systems-based process is key to integrating these initiatives and balancing affordability and system performance goals. Although Open Systems are being widely recognized as a key to affordability, most interpret Open Systems as a set of system attributes that need to be achieved. There are numerous claims of vendors saying they have an Open Systems architecture or how their system will evolve to an Open Systems architecture. This emphasis is not on increasing affordability but on attaching a politically correct label to their product. In this paper, we focus on the Open Systems process as the key to affordability.

One is the high cost of the INS, and the other is the cost and complexity of tightly-coupled OPS/INS integration. One of those two barriers has recently been diminished drastically with the development of a standardized software package for tightly-coupled integration. In the past, only the largest corporations have been able to pay the initial development cost for tightly-coupled OPS/INS integration, usually with funding from a large defense program. Using the new software package, integration and van test can be accomplished in a matter of days, and this has been demonstrated with field trials. The package is intended primarily for small companies that otherwise would not be able to build tightly-coupled OPS/INS systems at all. What would have been a prohibitive 3- or 4-man year development effort is reduced to a few man weeks. To accomplish an integration, the system integrator has to find a way, through serial interfaces or by some other means, to get the INS measurements of acceleration (accumulated velocity change \u0394V) and attitude rate (accumulated angle change \u0394\u03b8) into a processor, along with the raw data of a GPS receiver. He also has to find a way to time tag the INS \u0394V, \u0394\u03b8 with GPS time. The rest of tightly-coupled OPS/INS integration is predominately accomplished in the standardized software package. That leaves the cost of the INS as the only remaining barrier to the very widespread use of OPS/INS, and invites new development of low cost inertial sensors.

After transmitting a pulse in a given direction, the beam is switched, essentially instantaneously, to another position, after the instrumented range delay. In this second position, echoes from the first position, from multiple trips of the instrumented range, enter the one-way angular sidelobes of the first position. This interference is compounded if there are several beam positions in a pulse repetition period. The author proposes a method of phase coding the pulses in such a way that the pulse-to-pulse phase variation in each direction is orthogonal to every other phase code in the other directions. The codes are Walsh functions. These are sets of binary valued (+1 or -1) functions such that all of the functions in the set are mutually orthogonal. Not every possible number N of pulses in each direction and number K of beam positions can be accommodated, but a large variety of such combinations can be accommodated. Several examples are given.

This paper presents an avionics cost of ownership methodology developed for USAF, its data sources, and business metrics computed for USAF decision makers as we move toward operating avionics as a business. The business model is used to determine which existing avionics are candidates for replacement with new technology and to prioritize the replacements. These avionics are often used on multiple aircraft types which necessitates analysis of the causes of the high cost of ownership on each type. Databases are used to document the processing functions, data flow, and constraints of the item being analyzed. These constraints include physical, environmental, electrical, and data interfaces. Databases containing alternatives are evaluated against standard mission scenarios for aircraft utilizing these high cost avionics to determine their impact on performance, O and S costs, and mission effectiveness. The results of the foregoing analyses steps are then used in life cycle cost analyses which consider different retrofit scenarios for each alternative for each aircraft type against the avionics being analyzed for replacement. The alternatives are prioritized and a risk analysis performed considering technical, schedule, and cost growth risks. The avionics cost of ownership methodology described in this paper processes data from USAF maintenance organizations. This has revealed the very large expenditures being made to support highly unreliable avionics. These methods can be applied to all military and commercial aircraft systems to determine not only the cost of ownership of existing systems, but also the cost of ownership of new systems when they are retrofit", "date_publication": "Nov 1997", "doi": "10.1109/62.636797", "issue_date": "Nov 1997", "issue": "11", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "5763275", "firstpage": "3"}, "keywords": ["aerospace industry", "avionics", "commerce", "economics", "military avionics", "USAF", "acquisition cost", "avionics cost", "business metrics", "business model", "commercial aircraft", "cost growth risks", "data sources", "development cost", "hardware", "maintenance cost", "military aircraft", "mission effectiveness", "ownership", "risk analysis", "software", "standard mission scenarios", "support equipment", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft", "Business", "Costs", "Databases", "Hardware", "Performance evaluation", "Risk analysis", "Scheduling", "Software maintenance", ""], "authors": ["E.

These will be caused by the greater volume of more complex software, by the increased number of untested software states, and by more incidents of hardware/software interaction faults as a result of increased hardware speed and density. The traditional software implemented fault tolerance: approaches have been successfully utilized in life-critical systems, such as digital flight controls, where their additional costs can be easily justified. Examples include N-Version Programming and Recovery Block approaches. However, there is still a need for dependable computing for mission-critical applications as well. Often, these traditional techniques are avoided for mission-critical systems due to the difficulty in justifying their extra up-front development cost. We provide an alternative for the high \u201csunk cost\u201d of traditional software fault tolerance techniques. The methodology, called data fusion integrity processes (DFIPs), is a simple, yet effective technique for mission-critical systems. In addition, the approach establishes a framework from which other costlier, more extensive traditional techniques can be added.

Herein, we describe preliminary results from an ATI GMTI experiment. The SAR data described were collected by the dual-frequency NASA/JPL airborne radar in its standard dual-baseline ATI mode. The radar system imaged a variety of control targets including a pickup truck, sport utility vehicles, passenger cars, a bicycle, and pedestrians over multiple flight passes. The control targets had horizontal velocities of less than 5 m/s. The cross-sections of the targets were not purposely enhanced, although the targets' reflectivities may have been affected by the existence of the GPS equipment used to record the targets' positions. Single-look and multiple-look interferograms processed to the full azimuth resolution were analyzed. In the data processed to date, all of the targets were observed by visual inspection in at least one of the four combinations of dual-frequency, dual-baseline interferometric data.

The first program is written for the comparison of EKF- and CEKF-based SLAMS according to the computational complexity and covariance matrix error with the different numbers of landmarks. In the second program, EKF- and CEKF-based SLAM with the ICNN and JCBB data association algorithms simulations are presented.

The specific steps in the proposed process to achieve CMI compliance regarding the reprogrammability mandate include a review of existing policy, integration of government infrastructure and products, phasing in of technologies and functions related to reprogrammability, use case development, and requirements development. This process is envisioned as being leveraged on all future satellite systems requiring reprogrammability, including both commercial and government satellites.

Agricultural aircraft travel at much greater speeds than ground equipment (65 m/s, typically), so longitudinal (along-track) error in GPS-derived position is likely to be pronounced. Due to rapid ground speeds, determination of exact GPS-derived aircraft location requires special methodologies. To meet the need for determining ground position accurately, a ground-based spotting system using two strategically placed mirrors was designed to reflect sunlight to the belly of the aircraft when the plane passed over a ground reference point. The light beam was detected by a photocell on the airplane, causing a solid state relay to close through appropriate circuitry. When the relay closed, a record was placed in the data file for the airplane's Satloc GPS receiver, accurate to 0.01 s allowing exact position to be logged. Two stand-alone GPS receivers were evaluated along with the Satloc system, and their readings were compared with readings from the Satloc. For one day of testing used as an example, the Satloc lagged the ground reference point by an average of -4.53 m (S.D. = 0.68) in the east-west directions and led the reference point in the north-south directions by an average of +7.88 m (S.D. = 0.52). Positioning data from one stand-alone GPS receiver showed a distinct ground speed dependency, making it unsuitable for use in aircraft. Output from the other receiver (designed for aircraft use) was insensitive to ground speed changes but exhibited a look-ahead equivalent to 2-s at the ground speeds evaluated.", "date_publication": "March 2008", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2008.4476100", "issue_date": "March 2008", "issue": "3", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "9902599", "firstpage": "14"}, "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "agriculture", "aircraft communication", "aircraft navigation", "mirrors", "photoelectric cells", "radio receivers", "GPS-based swath guidance systems", "GPS-derived aircraft location", "GPS-derived position", "agricultural aircraft", "airplane Satloc GPS receiver", "airplane guidance", "cotton growth regulators", "crop dusting", "crop inputs", "data file", "defoliants", "global positioning system receivers", "ground position", "ground reference point", "ground-based spotting system", "insecticides", "light beam", "longitudinal error", "photocell", "positioning data", "rapid ground speeds", "remote sensing", "solid state relay", "strategically placed mirrors", "variable-rate aerial application", "Aircraft", "Airplanes", "Cotton", "Crops", "Global Positioning System", "Mirrors", "Regulators", "Relays", "Remote sensing", "Solid state circuits", ""], "authors": ["Steven J.

The focus has been exclusively on other areas, such as visual data flow and signal processing, but not on simplifying and automating instrument synthesis itself. A sad consequence of this mismatch between the tools available and the requirements of synthetic instrument design is that test engineers often are faced with considerable software challenge should they choose to apply a synthetic instrument rather than a natural instrument. But there's no inherent reason why this mismatch and consequent challenge should exist. We claim that given the proper tools, the tasks of specifying, synthesizing, operating, and maintaining synthetic instruments are simpler than the same tasks performed with natural instruments. In an attempt to close this gap and thereby prove our above assertion; we have developed a comprehensive software environment focused specifically on synthetic instrument technology. This new system fully synthesizes instruments and it does so automatically. Every aspect of the instrument is synthesized: the user interfaces, the upward automated test equipment drivers, the data persistence in files or databases, the calibration strategy, the visualization, and, of course, the measurement itself. Using this new architecture, we can synthesize, simulate, and implement instruments, automatically without end user coding. In addition, the environment provides a fundamentally robust approach to measurement re-use, as well as a way to predict performance of synthesized instruments, or to automatically synthesize instruments that meet particular desired specifications. Our system is based on measurement descriptions, not imperative procedures or data flow graphs. The test engineer specifies what is to be measured and the system \"places\" that measurement optimally on the hardware.

The distributed MEMS phase shifter consists of coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line and several MEMS bridges loading capacitively on transmission lines to create a slow wave structure. Two configurations of phase shifters are presented. 1) Conventional distributed MEMS transmission line (DMTL) 2) coplanar waveguide - microstrip - coplanar waveguide (CPW-MS-CPW), with microstrip as the transmission line and CPW as input and output line. The electromagnetic simulation results of gap height variation to change the phase velocity and, in turn, phase shift is presented. Work is underway to vary the gap height between transmission line and the bridge, applying the actuation voltage to bridge capacitors, which, in turn, will vary the bridge capacitance, changing the phase velocity on fabricated phase shifters. The match between simulated results and wafer level measurements are encouraging and will be presented in the full paper.

As verified by numerous practical applications in different fields, CBSD is able to increase software development productivity as well as improve software quality. Modern embedded real-time systems have both strict functional and non-functional requirements and they are essentially safety-critical, real-time, and embedded software-intensive systems. In particular, the crucial end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) properties should be assured in embedded systems such as timeliness and fault tolerance.

Nevertheless, all these objects have spatial dimensions and mutual interaction in their inheritance. The understanding of these dimensions and interactions are the key for health planning and management. For instance, these interactions may provide an excellent means of analyzing epidemiological attributes, revealing spatial trends, dependencies, and inter-relationships that would be more difficult to discover through conventional means. Moreover, it allows policy makers to easily visualize the problems in relation to the resources and prevailing needs. Spatial dimensions of health data give detailed and compelling answers to the difficult questions health service providers ask every day: Where is the disease coming from? How will it spread? Where is the nearest hospital? What is the fastest route for the ambulance? Where should we allocate our funding? In existing databases and systems of health management at public and private sectors in Pakistan, no authenticated and specific spatial reference is available. However, in a few cases, ambiguous and misleading references are there. Some isolated efforts are on the way to maintain such information as some private hospitals and companies maintain data which is commercially-available for pharmaceutical companies for marketing. The situation is getting worse due to rapidly increasing populations and thus creating further gaps in health services demand. The spatial contexts in accurate format are vital for integrating health attributes in the form of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) especially at the micro-scale. There are many potential users, but the major users will include National and Provincial health departments, Planning Commissions, researchers, etc. Undoubtedly, a health objects database could be a huge and difficult task to manage. Nonetheless, in Pakistan, precedence from National Database and Re- - gistration Authority (NADRA) is a good example of how to handle the quantity.

However, before autonomy can be routinely utilized, we must develop techniques for providing assurance that the system will perform correctly in flight. We describe why autonomous systems require advanced verification techniques, and offer some management and technical techniques for addressing the differences. Autonomous goal-driven spacecraft require advances in verification techniques because optimization (e.g., planning and scheduling) algorithms are at the core of much of autonomy. It Is the nature of such algorithms that over much of the input space an intuitively \"small\" change in the input results in a correspondingly \"small\" change in the output: This type of response typically leads one to conclude, quite reasonably, that if the two responses are correct, those responses \"between\" them will probably also be correct. However, there are certain regions in the input space where a \"small\" change in the input will result in a radically different output: One is not so inclined to conclude that all responses in these transition zones are likely to be correct. We believe, for two reasons, that these transition zones are one place where autonomous systems are likely to fail. First, boundary conditions, often a rich source of faults, are highly exercised in the transition zones, and so increase the likelihood of faults. Second, within the transition zone the algorithm outputs are likely to appear unusual, and, since the outputs of the algorithm become inputs to the remainder of the system, the whole system is probably pushed outside of its nominal usage profile: historically shown to be another good source of faults.

The range resolution is set by the bandwidth of the transmitted waveform, and is built up as a set of monotonically increasing stepped frequencies. As these frequencies are sampled sequentially, a constraint with SF-CW waveforms is the time restriction available to build up the bandwidth, imposed by the spatial sampling requirements along the aperture to avoid grating-lobe effects. To address this problem, an approach is outlined which allows the frequency spectrum to be greatly undersampled to provide a greater effective bandwidth. It was found that randomizing the set of frequencies omitted from sweep to sweep allowed significant thinning before the appearance of significant unwanted image artifacts due to the under-sampling. This scheme allows great flexibility in the choice of bandwidths that can be realized for a particular imaging scenario.

This process has been embodied in a software tool and is called defect detection and prevention (DDP). The DDP process can be succinctly stated as: determine where we want to be, what could get in the way and how we will get there. The \"determine where we want to be\" is captured as trees of requirements and the \"what could get in the way\" is captured as trees of potential failure modes. Scoring the impacts of these failure modes on the requirements results in a prioritized set of failure modes. The user then selects from a set of preventative measures, analyses, process controls and tests (PACTs) each of which has an effectiveness versus the various failure modes. It is the goal of the DDP process to optimally select the subset of the PACTs which minimizes the residual risk subject to the project resource constraints. The DDP process is intended to facilitate risk management over the entire project life cycle beginning with architectural and advanced technology decisions all the way through operation. As the project design, technology content, and implementation approach matures, the requirements and failure mode trees are elaborated upon to accommodate the additional information. Thus, the DDP process is a systematic, continuous, top-down approach to managing risk. Implementation of the DDP process requires a critical mass of expertise (usually the project team and a few specialists) and captures both their engineering judgement as well as available quantitative data. This additional data may result from models, layouts, prototype testing, other focused risk evaluations and institutional experiences. The DDP process also identifies areas where additional information would be advantageous, thus allowing a project to target critical areas of risk or risk uncertainty. This also allows the project to identify those areas which would benefit the most from application of other qu- - antitative tools and methods (e.g. Monte Carlo simulations, FMECAs, fault trees). The software tool supports the DDP process by providing guidance for implementing the process steps, graphical visualizations of the various trees, their interrelationships and the current risk landscape. The tool is capable of supporting on-the-fly knowledge elicitation as well as integrating off-line deliberations. There are a variety of available outputs including graphs, trees and reports as well as clear identification of the driving requirements, \"tall-pole\" residual risks and the PACTs which have been selected and agreed upon. The DDP process has been applied at various levels of assembly including the system and subsystem levels, as well as down to the component level.

Finally, recommendations are made on how to better prepare pre-graduate engineers for such a workplace", "date_publication": "June 2006", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2006.1662002", "issue_date": "June 2006", "issue": "6", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "9009621", "firstpage": "3"}, "keywords": ["aerospace engineering", "electrical engineering education", "military systems", "systems engineering", "United States Air Force", "avionics subsystems", "engineering curriculum", "junior engineers", "requirements engineering", "systems engineering", "undergraduate engineering disciplines", "Aerospace electronics", "Aerospace engineering", "Automotive engineering", "Costs", "Design engineering", "Engineering management", "Innovation management", "Risk management", "Signal processing", "Systems engineering and theory", ""], "authors": ["S.

Given its ability to measure small velocities (\u223c 10 cm/s) of relatively radar-dark water surfaces, there is great potential that this technique can be adapted for ground moving target indication (GMTI) applications, particularly as a method for detecting very slow targets with small radar cross-sections. In this paper we describe preliminary results from an ATI GMTI experiment. The SAR data described herein were collected by the dual-frequency NASA/JPL airborne radar in its standard dual-baseline ATI mode. The radar system imaged a variety of control targets including a pickup truck, sport utility vehicles, passenger cars, a bicycle, and pedestrians over multiple flight passes. The control targets had horizontal velocities of less than 5 m/s. The cross-sections of the targets were not purposely enhanced, although the targets' reflectivities may have been affected by the existence of the GPS equipment used to record the targets' positions.

The transition occurs through several steps. First, the installation and use of modern navigation and surveillance equipment is mandated by the regulatory organizations. The installations should take place in a sequenced fashion to allow time for companies to absorb the initial cost. Next, the existing network of terrestrial navigation aids is down-sized leaving only the areas of heaviest use in service.

Current implementations allow passengers to access Internet for pleasure and in some cases secure VPN access is provided to corporate networks. Several researchers are looking at the possibility of the existence of a total of three networks: passenger network (PN); crew network (CRN); and the control network (CON). Researchers envision an architecture where these three networks will co-exist in an airplane. The available Internet connectivity can be utilized for transporting flight critical information like cockpit flight data recorder (CFDR) data, digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data, cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data, and controller pilot data link communication. In addition, the Internet connectivity could also be used for other safety mechanisms like video surveillance and remote control of the flight. Security is one of the major concerns that affect the successful deployment of aircraft data networks (ADN) and other safety features. Several studies have been carried out to secure the network using firewalls and intrusion detection system but so far no study has focused on securing the communication channel (between the aircraft and the ground station) and its impact on the ADN. The scope of this research is to determine the viability and need of a security mechanism. The research also focuses on the performance of different security architectures and determine their usability in the framework of an ADN.", "date_publication": "May 2006", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2006.1635168", "issue_date": "May 2006", "issue": "5", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8934336", "firstpage": "12"}, "keywords": ["Internet", "aerospace computing", "aircraft communication", "aircraft displays", "virtual private networks", "Internet connectivity", "VPN access", "aircraft data networks", "cockpit flight data recorder data", "cockpit voice recorder data", "communication channel", "control network", "controller pilot data link communication", "corporate networks", "crew network", "digital flight data recorder data", "flight critical information", "intrusion detection system", "passenger network", "remote control", "video surveillance", "Aerospace safety", "Aircraft", "Airplanes", "Communication system control", "Communication system security", "Data security", "IP networks", "Internet", "Video surveillance", "Virtual private networks", ""], "authors": ["N.

In recent years, the ubiquitous deployment of personal computers has changed the way we work. Additionally, took designed to facilitate systems engineering have recently matured enough to start having a major impact on many major systems development efforts. Finally, the government's faster-better-cheaper acquisition philosophy has started driving prime contractors to a concurrent engineering approach toward systems engineering. This confluence of experts is has had unexpected impacts on both the flexibility and rigor of requirements management processes. While the maturing requirements and design took hold great promise in maintaining requirements traceability throughout the design process, the widespread use of desktop computing systems has inadvertently lulled many experienced systems engineers into sloppy processes because it now appears to be a simple matter to make a requirements change in a softcopy of a requirements document. Without strong process and management support, requirements changes inevitably start being derived in a broad spectrum of incompatible took and formats. This author is currently participating in the design phase of a major classified government satellite development effort. As an integral member of an extremely experienced requirements management team (boasting over 150 years of combined experience in the defense industry), this author has had the opportunity to watch the team navigate straight into many of the systems engineering potholes created when talented engineers implement concurrent engineering using a variety of tools without a consistent process framework.

A relevant new feature is the use of a speech understanding module able to extract semantically relevant information from the transcription of the sentences delivered by the speech recognizers.

Surface movement radar (SMR) technology has evolved over the years as part of an effort to mitigate runway incursion risks and enhance airport capacity. Surface movement surveillance systems of various types have been installed in major airports as early as the 1960s, and have kept evolving. The most recent system currently being deployed in the US by the FAA is the airport surface movement detection equipment model X (ASDE-X) system. In this system, unlike previous systems, the surface movement radar is just one of several sensors that are used in addition to transponder multilateration and GPS-based position reports, referred to as automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast or ADS-B; however, the SMR is a key subsystem. This paper contains an overview of the state-of-the-art SMR technology and provides an introduction on the use of radar technology for this commercial application. It focuses on the architecture, characteristics and technology of the radar sensor, the characteristics of the clutter and how it affects the performance, effects of multipath, automatic detection and comparison of several sensor architectures. Sensis Corporation has recently completed the testing of a new, improved SMR, which is now part of ASDE-X system.

Nonlinear apodization (NLA) techniques can also serve as powerful engines for effective superresolution and bandwidth extrapolation of coherent data for filling sparse apertures.

The history of space tells a story of thousands of engineers from a broad spectrum of engineering disciplines along with physicists, chemists, and so on involved from the beginning of space exploration. It is extremely difficult to introduce design into the undergraduate curriculum because of this broad reach of disciplines. Universities and colleges have resorted to \"paper designs\" for design courses for space-related curricula. This direction ignores the need for a practical approach and results in grandiose and superficial designs that have little chance of success. Senior design projects involving simple spacecraft where actual hardware may be built and launched would be more beneficial to the engineering student. The broad spectrum of disciplines involved in spacecraft or space mission design is actually an important lesson to be learned by engineering undergraduates. Many universities have addressed the multi-disciplinary nature of the modern engineering and, much to the delight of industry; have implemented student design projects involving a number of academic departments, even outside of engineering.

The conditions present in ATC are very specific: very spontaneous, the presence of noise, and high speed speech. So, with a typical speech recognizer the recognition results are unsatisfactory. We have to decide on the best option for the modeling: to develop acoustic models specific to those conditions from scratch using the data available for the new environment, or to carry out cross-task adaptation starting from reliable HMM models (usually requiring less data in the target domain). We begin with a description of the main techniques considered for cross-task adaptation, namely maximum a posteriori (MAP), maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR), and the two together. We have applied each in two speech recognizers for air traffic control tasks, one for spontaneous speech and the other for a command interface. We show the performance of these techniques and compare them with the development of a new system from scratch. We also show the results obtained for speaker adaptation using a variable amount of adaptation data. The main conclusion is that MLLR can outperform MAP when a large number of transforms is used, and MLLR followed by MAP is the best option. All of these techniques are better than developing a new system from scratch, showing the effectiveness of mean and variance adaptation", "date_publication": "Sept. 2006", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2006.1705165", "issue_date": "Sept. 2006", "issue": "9", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "9102227", "firstpage": "12"}, "keywords": ["air traffic control", "hidden Markov models", "maximum likelihood estimation", "regression analysis", "speech recognition", "HMM models", "acoustic models", "air traffic control system", "automatic speech recognition", "command interface", "cross-task adaptation", "maximum a posteriori", "maximum likelihood linear regression", "speaker adaptation", "speech recognition system", "Air traffic control", "Automatic speech recognition", "Databases", "Error analysis", "Maximum likelihood linear regression", "Noise robustness", "Speech recognition", "Stress", "System testing", "Working environment noise", ""], "authors": ["R. de Cordoba", "J.

It is well known that the parameters of an antenna array radar can be controlled by transmitting suitable correlated waveforms. This approach provides more degree-of-freedom and if constant-envelope (CE) or low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) correlated waveforms are used, it allows us to control the parameters of the radar without changing any hardware.

SDR allows the use of radio transceivers with minimal hardware, by replacing some hardware devices with rewritable software and editable algorithms. The biggest advantage of the SDR is the opportunity to reconfigure and modify the transceiver system characteristics according to the peculiarities of different standards.

Moreover, the battery is frequently exposed to repetitive high power demand, which consequently shortens the battery lifetime [1]. To overcome these problems, many parallel connections of energy sources have been proposed by scientists with the aim to reduce high peak power supply and repetitive power, as well as to save battery energy and lengthen its use [2], [3]. In this article, a parallel supercapacitors (SCs)- batteries scheme for battery hybrid electric vehicle (BHEV) and its control are proposed. The configuration consists of a parallel connection of batteries and SCs, which are connected to the inverter via a bidirectional dc-dc converter, as shown in Figure 1. This scheme intends to save braking energy for extending the driving range. In order to control the voltage and current of SCs, the control algorithms, composed of cascaded voltage and current loops based on the acceleration-based design (ABD), are developed.

Susceptibility of an aircraft is influenced by the following factors: 1) the location, number, and capabilities of the enemy air defense weapons; 2) the aircraft's basic design (e.g., geometric shape and the use of radar absorbing materials to degrade the enemy's radar detection capabilities and speed or agility to avoid any approaching enemy missiles) and onboard equipment or weapons (e.g., the use of onboard electronic attack equipment to degrade enemy missile guidance systems and antiradiation missile (ARM) to destroy the enemy air defense systems); 3) the tactics that are employed by the pilot. We can't \u201ccontrol\u201d the location, number, and capabilities of the enemy weapons. Once the aircraft enters the service, its basic design cannot be changed any more. For the aircraft in service, its susceptibility can be further reduced by adding more advanced onboard equipment or weapons and employing more flexible tactics. The advanced aircraft in development (e.g., the fifth generation fighter aircraft) may exhibit a lower degree of susceptibility when they first enter the service, however, this superiority will be gradually eliminatedby proliferating threats [4]. The most advanced aircraft today also face the problem of reducing their susceptibility in the future. We present a generic model to gain insight into how electronic counter measures (ECMs) affect the susceptibility of aircraft. Our main purpose is to reduce the susceptibility of the aircraft in service, by applying airborne ECM techniques. Although some advanced stealth aircraft have been put into service in some countries, more aircraft in service are not stealthy, especially in developing countries. Compared with stealth coating and other techniques, ECMs have some advantages in reducing the susceptibility of aircraft in service. For example, the stealth coating is often sensitive to the radar frequency, and the maintenance cost of the st- alth coating may be too high for some aircraft [5]. Shaping the surface of the aircraft to obtain a smaller radar cross section (RCS) value may be effective to decrease monostatic radar's returns, but this does not apply to bistatic radar [6].

The program concepts are presented for initial determination of the needs and possibilities, and examples are presented along with flight data collected in the University's fleet of aircraft.", "date_publication": "June 2007", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2007.384075", "issue_date": "June 2007", "issue": "6", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "9616533", "firstpage": "9"}, "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "aerospace industry", "aircraft", "program processors", "Center for Sensors and Sensor Systems", "Saint Louis University", "aviation aircraft", "aviation industry", "flight operations quality assurance", "nonintrusive system", "obstacles", "post-processor software", "preprocessor system", "quick access recorder", "Aerospace engineering", "Aircraft", "Costs", "Data analysis", "Data engineering", "Heart", "Monitoring", "Production", "Quality assurance", "Sensor systems", ""], "authors": ["Kyle Mitchell", "Beshara Sholy", "Alan J.

A UAV is a low-cost non-piloted airplane designed to operate in D-cube (Dangerous-Dirty-Dull) situations [8]. Many types of UAVs exist today; however with the advent of UAV's civil applications, the class of mini/micro UAVs is emerging as a valid option in a commercial scenario. This type of UAV shares limitations with most computer embedded systems: limited space, limited power resources, increasing computation requirements, complexity of the applications, time to market requirements, etc. UAVs are automatically piloted by an embedded system named \"Flight Control System.\" Many of those systems are commercially available today, however no commercial system exists nowadays that provides support to the actual mission that the UAV should perform. This introduces a hardware/software architecture specially designed to operate as a flexible payload and mission controller in a mini/micro UAV. Given that the missions UAVs can carry on justify their existence; we believe that specific payload and mission controllers for UAVs should be developed.

Traditional airborne surveillance simulations have been limited in either spatial or temporal fidelity due to the expensive software and hardware requirements.

Based on the visual programming environment Khoros, the Radar Analysis Simulation Tool (RAST-K) is a flexible simulation for quickly prototyping airborne surveillance configurations containing radar system features, point targets, and USGS maps. Additionally, RAST-K has been ported to a Linux cluster to simulate realistic flight scenarios. As these scenarios involve changing characteristics between Coherent Processing Intervals (CPIs), additional interfaces were developed to control platform, target, and environmental attributes, as well as partition the simulations across the resource of processors. This paper will discuss these topics by providing an overview of the RAST-K simulation and its use in the simulation of a circular UHF antenna configuration.

The absence of formal requirements and oversight, coupled with strong pressure for rapid deployment, caused the program to fail its first operational tests and actually delayed its deployment to the Held. The lack of measurable requirements and the need to integrate multiple third-party products and systems made it impossible to establish a system baseline and to test TBMCS in realistic conditions. Thus, significant problems manifested themselves only during official government tests. Moreover, despite nominal authority, the lead contractor had little or no control over the government-furnished elements and commercial off-the-shelf products that TBMCS was to incorporate. Experience with TBMCS leads to several conclusions. First, the more complex a system, the greater the need for rigor and discipline in engineering processes. Second, well-defined requirements are essential. Third, mandating the incorporation of specific third-party hardware or software may create severe problems for system development.

This paper analyzes the causation of such problems, does research on the relationship between target energy characteristics and detection probability, and presents a novel filter of energy distribution adaptive rectification (EDARF). Based on the EDARF, an improved framework of dim small target detection is proposed to rectify the energy distribution in the clutter-suppressed images by conventional adaptive filters.

At assembly complete stage, the ISS will be served by four PV modules. Each module contains two independent primary power channels such that one failure will result in loss of only one-half of the power generation capability. During the early stages of assembly, the ISS is served by only one PV module. Flight 12A brings one more module to the ISS and so on until the fourth module is installed during Flight 15A. Power channel components are arranged in orbit replaceable units (ORU) and repairs are accomplished by replacing the failed ORU. While a power channel is operating, all of its ORUs are maintained within their allowable temperature ranges by a balance between the heat generated and heat removed. Heat removal is accomplished either passively or by an active thermal control system (TCS), called photovoltaic thermal control system (PV TCS). The PV module P6 has been operating flawlessly since December 2000 with 100% power availability, as of this writing. This far exceeds the design goal and expectations. However, since a random failure may occur at anytime, the operators must be prepared to handle this situation. An ORU failure may result in dormancy of one or more ORUs; in the worst case, dormancy of all ORUs within one power channel and shutdown of the PV TCS for that power channel. Dormant ORUs may exceed their allowable temperature ranges and that may result in failure of additional ORUs. It is very important to ensure that all dormant, but otherwise operable ORUs remain within their allowable temperature ranges to prevent failure propagation. This describes how the dormant ORUs in the failed power channel will be thermally protected until replacement and restoration has been completed. These procedures use the following processes: (a) backfeed of primary power from another operating power channel, (b) supply of dc control power from the operating chan- nel on the same PV module, and (c) perform thermal control based on the monitored parameters. These procedures have been thoroughly coordinated by all affected technical teams and approved by all required boards.", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2007.4376106", "issue_date": "Oct. 2007", "issue": "10", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "9631478", "firstpage": "13"}, "keywords": ["photovoltaic cells", "power supply circuits", "space vehicles", "DC control power", "Flight 12A", "International Space Station", "active thermal control system", "heat removal", "orbit replaceable unit", "photovoltaic module", "photovoltaic thermal control system", "random power failure hardware protection", "Assembly", "Control systems", "Hardware", "International Space Station", "Photovoltaic systems", "Power generation", "Protection", "Solar power generation", "Temperature control", "Temperature distribution", ""], "authors": ["Gyan Hajela"], "citations": [], "arnumber": "4376106"}, "Article 4": {"references": ["994803"], "details": {"title": "Channel Measurement/Modeling for Airport Surface Communications: Mobile and Fixed Platform Results", "volume": "22", "date": "Oct. 2007", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "lastpage": "30", "pages": "25 - 30", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 05 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issn": "0885-8985", "abstract": "We provide examples of measurement and modeling results for wireless channel characteristics around airport surface areas.

Furthermore, it is likely that only thin-film array technology will be able to meet device specific power requirements exceeding 1 kW/kg (photovoltaic and integrated substrate/blanket mass only).", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2007.4376107", "issue_date": "Oct. 2007", "issue": "10", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "9680269", "firstpage": "20"}, "keywords": ["solar cell arrays", "space vehicles", "thin film devices", "crystalline multijunction arrays", "flexible substrates", "future spacecraft", "high-altitude airship", "lightweight substrates", "next-generation photovoltaics", "solar array technology", "thin film device", "thin film photovoltaics", "thin-film array", "Computational Intelligence Society", "Crystallization", "Optical arrays", "Photonic band gap", "Photovoltaic cells", "Space technology", "Substrates", "Temperature", "Thin film devices", "Transistors", ""], "authors": ["Lawrence M.

Using precision real-time GPS and a sensor controlled flight management system, the system will be able to fly pre-defined paths with great precision. The expected performance of the flight control system will constrain the flight path to be within a 10 m diameter tube about the desired flight track. The radar will be designed to be operable on a Unpiloted Arial Vehicle (UAV) but will initially be demonstrated on a NASA Gulfstream III. The radar will be fully polarimetric, with a range bandwidth of 80 MHz (2 m range resolution), and will support a 16 km range swath. The antenna will be electronically steered along track to assure that the antenna beam can be directed independently, regardless of the wind direction and speed. Other features supported by the antenna include elevation monopulse and pulse-to-pulse re-steering capabilities that will enable some novel modes of operation. The system will nominally operate at 45,000 feet (13,800 m).

The majority of the research reported in these areas consists of empirical studies. This article provides a theoretical basis for understanding some of the fundamental trade-offs associated with these CID techniques, such as the following: What are the relative advantages of RDI over HRR radar or of finer versus coarser resolution in the HRR process? What is the relative advantage of coherent over noncoherent processing? How do target correlations, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and target scintillation affect the ability to identify targets? Because confusion matrices are often used to characterize the performance of CID systems, we provide analytical methods for calculating the entries in confusion matrices as a function of the issues cited above. These formulations provide analytical bases to guide system trade-off decisions. The organization of this paper is as follows. We begin with a short overview of HRR and RDI and then explore a number of ways to process the associated target templates that range from an ideal, theoretical approach to an approach that would be more feasible to implement within current-day radars. We first develop analytic template-based methodologies for constructing confusion matrix entries for nonscintillating targets for both coherent and noncoherent processing assumptions. The confusion matrix entries in these cases are conditional probabilities obtained from a simple rule: find the probability that among m (in general, correlated) random variables, each associated with a possible target, that any one is the largest. For the noncoherent case, the successful application of this rule requires the target template values to explicitly include the effects of thermal noise (noise-adjusted templates). We conclude by showing h- - ow to calculate theoretically optimum results (e.g., using maximum likelihood techniques) for noncoherent processing of targets that exhibit uncorrelated Swerling 1 scintillation in ail resolution bins as a function of the SNR. This approach allows us to include overall target intensity (e.g., total radar cross section (RCS)) as a further factor in the target decision process.", "date_publication": "Sept. 2007", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2007.4350285", "issue_date": "Sept. 2007", "issue": "9", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "9631536", "firstpage": "53"}, "keywords": ["Doppler radar", "radar imaging", "radar resolution", "radar target recognition", "thermal noise", "1D high-range-resolution radar", "2D range-Doppler-imaging radar", "combat identification", "confusion matrices", "target correlations", "target decision process", "target identification", "target intensity", "target scintillation", "thermal noise", "Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society", "Inverse synthetic aperture radar", "Performance analysis", "Polarization", "Radar cross section", "Radar theory", "Random variables", "Signal resolution", "Signal to noise ratio", "Tutorial", ""], "authors": ["Kent Haspert", "James Heagy", "Roger Sullivan"], "citations": ["6237585"], "arnumber": "4350285"}, "Article 5": {"references": ["1390822", "891178", "1049253", "1297531"], "details": {"title": "Security and Information Systems for Air Company", "volume": "22", "date": "Sept. 2007", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "lastpage": "27", "pages": "23 - 27", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issn": "0885-8985", "abstract": "Security is always a priority in the implementation of information technology solutions.

In this context, Low Probability of Interception (LPI) Radars try to use signals that are difficult to intercept and/or identify. Spread spectrum signals are strong candidates for this application, and systems using special frequency or polyphase modulation schemes are being exploited. Frequency hopping, however, has not received much attention. The typical LPI radar at this moment of the technology is a CW-LFM radar. The simplicity of the technology is its best point. Polyphase codes, on the other hand have the inherent advantage of high instantaneous bandwidth regardless of observation time. But the complexity of the hardware is also higher. FH signals have traditionally been considered of lower performance but higher complexity, due to the difficulties to compensate the individual dopplers for the individual range cells in the receiver. One important point is that an FH radar must be clearly distinguished from an agile frequency radar. In the latter, a pulsed signal is transmitted using different frequencies from pulse to pulse. In an FH radar the frequency changes must be during the pulse. In fact, in an LPI FH radar, a CW frequency hopped signal is used. A radar system concept is proposed in which it shows how these problems can be overcome in a tracking application. Also, the signal format is analyzed under the scope of future decade digital interceptors, showing that, in fact, this kind of signal exhibits improvement in some performances and requires a hardware that is only slightly more complex than that needed for CW-LFM systems", "date_publication": "Apr 2000", "doi": "10.1109/62.839631", "issue_date": "Apr 2000", "issue": "4", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "6585336", "firstpage": "23"}, "keywords": ["CW radar", "phase coding", "radar receivers", "radar tracking", "spread spectrum radar", "Doppler compensation", "SS-FH signals", "autocorrelation function", "digital interceptors", "low probability of interception radar", "polyphase codes", "radar sensors", "radar tracking", "Bandwidth", "Frequency modulation", "Hardware", "Radar applications", "Radar detection", "Radar tracking", "Security", "Signal analysis", "Signal processing", "Spread spectrum radar", ""], "authors": ["M.

ATE systems may be in the form of large general-purpose systems that can test a wide variety of products or the more commonly used custom, turnkey systems that are designed for specific test application(s) and requirements. Turnkey ATE systems are labor-intensive; as a result, even a relatively simple turnkey tester is costly and may take months (or even years) to develop, integrate, and deploy. The main reason for this aspect of turnkey ATE systems is that even though the instrumentation may be off-the-shelf components, most everything else is custom and requires design, development, extensive debug and integration. Time and again, systems integrators have tried to find a solution that would combine the cost effectiveness of COTS systems with the flexibility of custom ATE. This paper suggests a solution to this problem and that it is feasible to combine COTS testers with custom requirements. This solution, called CreATE, provides a flexible architecture using COTS components (including instruments, cabling and interfacing products)", "date_publication": "Apr 2000", "doi": "10.1109/62.839630", "issue_date": "Apr 2000", "issue": "4", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "6585335", "firstpage": "19"}, "keywords": ["automatic test equipment", "automatic test software", "ATE systems", "CreATE concept", "cost effectiveness", "creative ATE", "custom requirements", "flexible architecture", "off-the-shelf interfacing", "reconfigurable COTS test systems", "test software", "turnkey systems", "System testing", "Wiring", ""], "authors": ["L.

Boeing is responding by guiding large advances in the state-of-the-art of fiber optic gyro technology and developing a new associated navigation system. All of the very stringent Strategic Weapons System (SWS) performance, reliability, and maintainability requirements continue to be exceeded by the Electrostatically Supported Gyro Navigator (ESGN). The Electrostatically Supported Gyro (ESG), in production for over 25 years, is the most critical and costly component of the current inertial navigation system. ESGs, however, are extremely expensive to manufacture and repair. Furthermore, the system-level electronic components are difficult to replace because they are rapidly becoming obsolete. The current initiative is focused on containing total ownership costs, especially maintenance costs, without any relaxation of performance, reliability, or maintainability requirements. The key element of this initiative is new gyro technology based on rapidly improving precision Interferometric Fiber Optic Gyro IFOG performance, along with cost reduction of fiber and manufacturing processes.

It argues that this functionality may be one mode in a multi-function UWB UHF system, which jointly possesses the capabilities for air target MTI and high resolution FOPEN SAR. The radar platform may be a UAV or an aircraft, whereas, we propose to use the push boom type of antenna mounting previously adopted with the advantage for the CARABAS II UWB VHF SAR. Presently, the push booms will hold a set of UWB UHF antenna elements. This paper relates GMTI to SAR, extended from imaging stationary ground to the 4-parameter set of targets in linear and uniform motion relative to ground. It is recognised that this extended imaging problem depends on one new parameter, i.e., the SAR focusing velocity. The required signal processing may be tackled in an efficient manner by a hierarchical scheme based on iteratively merging subapertures and increasing the resolution. Rejection of stationary clutter and detection occurs on all levels of increasing resolution.

The bursty nature of many data traffic sources suggests that data transmissions in communication devices may provide natural opportunities for charge recovery. We model the data source as a stochastic process and let the cell discharge be driven by such a process. We use a model of a dual lithium ion insertion cell to identify the improvement to cell capacity that results from the stochastic discharge.

These data, some existing for many years on analog videotape, have been converted to a reproducible digital format and edited to generate test sequences several minutes long for many scenarios. Sequences include non-alarm video, intrusions and nuisance alarm sources, taken with a variety of imaging sensors including monochrome CCD cameras and infrared (thermal) imaging cameras, under a variety of daytime and nighttime conditions. The paper presents an analysis of the variables and estimates the complexity of a thorough data set. Some of this video data test has been digitized for CD-ROM storage and playback. We are considering developing a DVD disk for possible use in screening and testing VMDs prior to government testing and deployment. In addition, this digital video data may be used by VMD developers for further refinement or customization of their product to meet specific requirements. These application scenarios may also be used to define the testing parameters for future procurement qualification. A personal computer may be used to play back either the CD-ROM or the DVD video data. A consumer electronics-style DVD player may be used to replay the DVD disk.

Today everyone thinks digital, whereas more than 50% of electronic advances since society founding 50 years ago were in the analog or continuous domain. It is too easy to forget that before the 1970s and 1980s analog systems had been the norm. Digital electronics emerged late in WWII, when the US Army contracted with the University of Pennsylvania to compute extensive artillery firing tables. The Cold War substantially accelerated advances in solid state electronics which led to the microelectronics that are so ubiquitous today. Defense and then aerospace programs were symbiotic with electronics in the development and mass production of transistors, integrated circuits, microelectronics, microprocessors, magnetic and then solid state memory. Small, reliable, low power and high performance electronics were the key to aerospace progress. The government backed virtually all these developments out of necessity. The power of computers has increased by over a million since 1972 and is still climbing. The initial enabling technology for advances in military electronics was the almost forgotten vacuum tube. The existence of electrons was first recognized as the \"Edison Effect\" in 1883. The seminal event in electronics was the audion invented by Lee De Forrest in 1906. The audion appeared just three years after the first Wright brother's flight and four years before the Army purchased their first Wright airplane. Up until the World War I (WWI) radio amateurs were the electronics pioneers, but the war created new demand for radio communications. Electronics expanded from communications into radar, navigation and control systems in World War II (WWII).

Personal identification and detection of illegal substances including explosives have come to the forefront. With the proliferation of computers the security of information has also become a major concern. Substantial advances have been made over the last three decades in entry control, counter-terrorism, cryptology and airport protection. The utilization of technology has become an irreversible trend. Electronic devices and systems are capable of automatically and tirelessly monitoring and reporting breaches of security. For example, airport security began with physical protection of the facility with fences and area surveillance. The most recent concern is detecting explosives in both checked and early-on baggage, Other techniques relate to monitoring passengers for weapons as they transit the terminal building, especially crowds gathered at the metal detectors and X-ray machines. The application of electronics has produced reliability improvements and cost savings in systems that protect against unauthorized entry and numerous other threats. PCs have become the heart of security command and control systems. Most PC platforms rely on the proven software stability of Windows NT and present data in human-friendly, graphic format.

A fellow German, Christian Hulsmeyer, can be called the first radar engineer. In the early 1900s, Hulsmeyer built, patented, demonstrated, and tried to sell to various shipping companies and navies a shipborne radar, based on Hertz's apparatus, for avoiding collisions of ships with one another. He had no success in selling his radar. His work faded from memory, even in Germany where it had to be reinvented when the need for it finally arose. Although the basic principle of radar had been demonstrated in the early part of the 20th century, there was no further activity for over thirty years. The occurrence that, led to modern radar was when the World War I fabric-coated, externally braced biplane having fixed landing gear and open cockpit was replaced by the all-metal single-wing monoplane with its retractable landing gear, enclosed cockpit, and high horsepower engines that allowed it to fly long distances at high altitude carrying a large bomb-load. In the thirties, attack by bomber aircraft was a serious concern and military leaders were pessimistic about being able to defend against it. It was said at that time that \"the bomber will always get through.\" In the 1930s, however, the development of VHF technology was rapidly flourishing in many countries, and it wasn't long before it was noticed that an aircraft, ship, or person passing through the propagation path of a two-way communications link produced a disturbance at the receiver. Radar was thus reborn. The early history of radar has been told in detail in many places, so it need not be repeated here. Suffice to say that at the start of World War II, in September 1939, eight countries had independently and almost simultaneously discovered and explored radar, and most had operational systems available by the time they entered the war. These countries were the US, UK, Germany, France, the Soviet Union- Japan, Italy, and the Netherlands.", "date_publication": "Oct. 2000", "doi": "10.1109/62.879403", "issue_date": "Oct. 2000", "issue": "10", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "6750888", "firstpage": "27"}, "keywords": ["airborne radar", "history", "military aircraft", "military radar", "radar", "France", "Germany", "Heinrich Hertz", "Hulsmeyer", "Italy", "Japan", "Netherlands", "Soviet Union", "UK", "US", "VHF technology", "World War I", "World War II", "biplane", "bomber aircraft", "radar developments", "radar engineer", "single-wing monoplane", "Aircraft", "Dipole antennas", "Fellows", "Frequency", "Gears", "Marine vehicles", "Poles and towers", "Radar antennas", "Radar detection", "Transmitters", ""], "authors": [], "citations": ["7226333", "989947"], "arnumber": "879403"}, "Article 6": {"references": [], "details": {"title": "Energy and power", "volume": "15", "date": "Oct. 2000", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "lastpage": "26", "pages": "19 - 26", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issn": "0885-8985", "abstract": "Energy sources for aerospace systems include electrochemicals, mechanical rotation, solar illumination, radioisotopes, and nuclear reactors.

The Voice Control system is reliable, speaker independent, and has a total added hardware price tag of under $50.00 per station. In contrast to traditional voice recognition systems, operator training is not required. OO-ALC has developed a general-purpose internal interface (Voice Control) to the Speech Recognition and Text-To-Speech engines provided by Microsoft. Voice Control can be accessed by any 32-bit Windows software, which has windows messaging capability. This is available to standard programming languages such as LabWindows CVI, Borland or Microsoft C/C++, Visual Basic, or even commercial packages such as Lotus Notes and Microsoft Word. Through Voice Control, the computer uses both video and voice prompts to request input from the operator. The operator is allowed to enter data and to control the software flow by voice command or from the keyboard or mouse. The Voice Control system allows for dynamic specification of a grammar set, or legal set of commands. The use of a reduced grammar set greatly increases recognition accuracy. The computer voice enables the operator to focus his attention away from the computer screen, which is required for activities such as probing a circuit card and taking readings. When the operator takes readings, the computer, to insure reliable entry, echoes his voice entries. With electronic tuning, speech synthesis allows the operator to hear the resulting reading, enabling him to focus on the circuit card instead of constantly turning his head to see the computer screen.

Increased levels of information exchange will be necessary for this concept to work safely; therefore, air-ground communications will transition from voice to data link communications. The nature of data link communications procurement requires that avionics suppliers not only verify their products meet contractual performance requirements, but also demonstrate that their products are compatible with civil communication networks and ATC. In addition, the USAF needs to demonstrate that their crew-training program is adequate to maintain the required level of aircrew proficiency and equipment can be maintained for the required level of system performance, integrity, and interoperability with the civil environment.

The ability to overcome these challenges is constrained by such factors as shrinking budgets, limited computational capacity and diminished manufacturing sources effects that impact both hardware and software options. Wholesale redevelopment is often cost prohibitive, particularly since large portions of embedded applications continue to fulfil mission requirements. Solutions must preserve prior investments while providing efficient pathways for continued technology refresh. A technology solution for affordable modernization of legacy system software is being development. The Embedded Information System Re-engineering (EISR) project is developing an automation-assisted JOVIAL-to-C re-engineering capability that permits simultaneous modernization of both the structure and source language of legacy embedded applications. Engineers will be able to apply the proven labor-saving visualization and analysis features of modern CASE tools to legacy JOVIAL applications. EISR will thus allow the DoD to recapture previous investments in proven legacy algorithms and mission capabilities while permitting the full exploitation of COTS economies of scale.

It is important that the output from the sensors is linear along the fence, to ensure that there is no point on the perimeter less sensitive to intruder attack. The investigation reported in this paper aims to discover whether the performance of acoustic detection systems could be improved through research into fence acoustics. Using models of fence vibrations, sensors could be positioned to obtain a more linear response. In addition, through knowledge of the fence vibrations produced by both real attacks and the typical causes of false alarms, a system could be designed which could better distinguish between them, giving a lower false alarm rate and increased detection performance.

DoD 5000 2-R policy is implemented in the area of ATS by: 1) leveraging non-recurring investments already made in ATS Families across multiple applications; 2) evolving the capabilities of these Families of ATS by migrating their commercial item content toward industry-wide standards; 3) facilitating intra- and inter-service level interoperability by encouraging common and interoperable support solutions; and 4) encouraging the use of commercial items within ATS Families and as ATS alternatives. To implement this policy, the DoD ATS Executive Agent was chartered to establish and maintain a waiver process for those programs that propose not to use the DoD designated standard families of ATS or commercial testers. Contrary to popular belief, the DoD ATS Selection Process has been established to facilitate the mission of the DoD Program Manager by helping him or her choose the most cost effective ATS solution that fulfils his or her mission support requirements. The DoD ATS family was not established to impose support solutions upon the DoD Program Manager, but rather to provide a variety of available and proven alternatives that may meet their needs while significantly reducing expected life cycle costs.

Besides the well-established airborne threats, new platforms for air surveillance and attacking devices have appeared and recognized air picture (RAP) production needs to be revised and modified following the events of September 11, 2001. From a military operational and logistic support point of view, it is well-known that not only the long range radars currently in operation, but also the recently procured radars, degrade in performance rapidly and their maintenance costs are high. Using the possibilities offered by emerging technical developments, the problem is to upgrade sensors and existing infrastructure in a way that exploits the information gathered optimally. It is the opinion of this author that one of the most promising approaches to emphasis net-centricity is the use of radar-triangle netcentric structures augmented by netted VHF radars to solve these tasks in a cost-effective manner.

Many of these applications are directly related to safety-of-life uses such as all-weather aircraft precision approach and landing, ship navigation in restricted waters, and emergency response vehicle tracking and management. GPS has significantly improved efficiency in commercial applications such as truck, train, and even, individual container tracking and dispatch. There is a similar dependency within the military - not only in vehicle navigation ut also in areas such as precision weapon guidance and \"blue force\" tracking. This dependency on GPS has brought significant attention on the potential for an asymmetric vulnerability on this low signal power radio navigation system. Threat systems to GPS exist, are commercially available, and have been used in combat. The technology is not complex, and even simple, low-cost systems could cause significant GPS denial. Furthermore, as other global navigation satellite systems gain maturity and widespread use, one can easily imagine the threat expanding to cover those systems as well. Herein, we describe a project directed by Congress, starting in 1997, to develop the capability to detect and locate sources of unintentional interference and intentional jamming, and to assess the effectiveness and utility of such a system. Under this project, SPAWAR and FALON, Inc. have successfully developed and demonstrated a prototype system small enough to be compatible with unmanned aerial vehicles named location of GPS interferers (LOCO GPSI). The LOCO GPSI system employs short baseline antenna interferometry and a highly sensitive, rapidly scanning receiver to detect and precisely direction find (DF) the interference source. Interference source location is determined by triangulating successive DF lines of position.

Laser scanning technology has been used for some time in a range of industrial and commercial applications. These span from detecting hands when they are close to dangerous machinery to preventing collisions at container ports and monitoring manufacturing processes. Laser scanners are non-contact measurement systems and scan their surroundings two-dimensionally. This describes the application of laser scanning to physical security, including modifications to such systems for their use as perimeter intrusion detection systems (PIDS). In these systems, motion detection is provided by a pulsed laser beam by measuring the propagation time for the reflected beam to return to its source. Using this information, a contour plot of the surrounding area is built up. Once this contour information has been obtained, the detector can recognise the addition of an object to its field of view through a change in the programmed surroundings. Consequently, the size, shape, and direction of targets moving in the frame can be assessed and an alarm output given, if required. This explains the main operating principles of the systems, including mechanisms for the detection of a potential intruder and the handling of false alarms.

In an environment where standards drive system designs (and provide an avenue for focused advancement in technology), standards for BIT are very much in an evolutionary state. The reasons for advancing the effectiveness of BIT include reduced support overhead, greater, confidence in operation, and increased system availability. The cost of supporting military electronic systems (avionics, communications, and weapons systems) has driven much of the development in BIT technology. But what about the systems that support these end items that contain test and measurement instrumentation - such as automatic test equipment (ATE), simulators and avionics development suites? There has also been a beneficial effect on the maintenance and availability of these systems due to the infusion of BIT into their component assemblies. But the effect has been much more sporadic and fragmented. This paper looks at the state of BIT in test and measurement instruments, explain its affect on system readiness, and present ideas on how to improve BIT technologies and standards. This will not provide definitive answers to BIT development questions, since the factors that affect it are specific to the instrument itself. The topics covered in this paper are: definitions of built-in test, instrument BIT history, importance of BIT fault coverage and isolation in support systems, overview of BIT development process issues that limit the effectiveness of BIT Standards related to instrument BIT, making BIT more effective in support system maintenance and availability and conclusions.", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2004.1346885", "issue_date": "Aug. 2004", "issue": "8", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8146096", "firstpage": "3"}, "keywords": ["built-in self test", "fault location", "maintenance engineering", "military avionics", "military communication", "reliability", "weapons", "BIT", "avionics", "built in test", "communications", "fault coverage", "fault isolation", "maintenance lifecycle costs", "measurement instrumentation", "military electronic systems", "support overhead reduction", "support system availability", "support system maintenance", "system complexity", "system designs", "weapons systems", "Aerospace electronics", "Automatic test equipment", "Automatic testing", "Costs", "Electronic equipment testing", "Instruments", "Life testing", "Military communication", "System testing", "Weapons", ""], "authors": ["R.

An INS determines the position, velocity, and attitude of a moving platform by processing the accelerations and angular velocity measurements of an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Accurate estimation of the initial attitude angles of an IMU is essential to ensure precise determination of the position and attitude of the moving platform. These initial attitude angles are usually estimated using alignment techniques. Due to the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor measurement (especially for the gyroscopes), the initial attitude angles may not be computed accurately enough. In addition, the estimated initial attitude angles may have relatively large uncertainties that may affect the accuracy of other navigation parameters. This article suggests processing the gyro and accelerometer measurements with multiple levels of wavelet decomposition to remove the high frequency noise components. The proposed wavelet de-noising method was applied on a navigational grade inertial measurement unit (LTN90-100). The results showed that accurate alignment procedure and fast convergence of the estimation algorithm, in addition to reducing the estimation covariance of the three attitude angles, could be obtained.", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2004.1365016", "issue_date": "Oct. 2004", "issue": "10", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8164145", "firstpage": "32"}, "keywords": ["acceleration measurement", "angular measurement", "gyroscopes", "inertial navigation", "inertial systems", "signal denoising", "wavelet transforms", "LTN90-100", "acceleration measurements", "accelerometer measurements", "aerospace systems", "alignment techniques", "angular velocity measurements", "estimation algorithm", "estimation covariance", "gyro measurements", "gyroscopes", "inertial measurement unit", "inertial navigation system", "land vehicle navigation", "navigation parameters", "sensor measurement", "signal-to-noise ratio", "wavelet de-noising", "wavelet decomposition", "Acceleration", "Angular velocity", "Gyroscopes", "Inertial navigation", "Land vehicles", "Measurement units", "Noise reduction", "Position measurement", "Signal to noise ratio", "Velocity measurement", ""], "authors": ["N.

The FCS provides the capability to stabilize and control the aircraft, while the FMS is responsible for flight planning and navigation. A clear trend in the aerospace industry is to place greater reliance on software systems, and many FCS and FMS subsystems are implemented primarily in software. For example, within the FCS is the flight guidance system (FGS) that generates roll and pitch guidance commands. Similarly, within the FMS is the vertical navigation (VNAV) function that acts like a third crew member in the cockpit, ordering mode change requests and resetting target altitude values to enable the aircraft to track the vertical flight plan. We have developed formal, executable models of the requirements for the mode logic of a FGS and for portions of the VNAV functionality. We have also conducted a comprehensive software safety analysis on the FGS mode logic model, and are completing the analysis of the VNAV model. This analysis uses as its starting point several \"traditional\" safety analysis techniques such as a functional hazard assessment (FHA), a fault tree analysis (FTA), and a failure mode effects analysis (FMEA). However, we are also using formal methods techniques known as model checking and theorem proving to verify the presence of safety properties in the model. This paper summarizes the (now completed) safety analysis that was performed on the FGS model, and highlights the similarities and differences with the (still on-going) safety analysis of the FMS model. In particular, we summarize progress made to date in the use of formal methods to verify the presence of the required safety properties in the models themselves.", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2004.1365014", "issue_date": "Oct. 2004", "issue": "10", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8164143", "firstpage": "21"}, "keywords": ["aircraft control", "aircraft navigation", "avionics", "failure analysis", "fault trees", "formal verification", "safety-critical software", "software fault tolerance", "theorem proving", "FGS mode logic model", "aerospace industry", "avionics", "failure mode effects analysis", "fault tree analysis", "flight control system", "flight guidance system", "flight management system", "flight planning", "formal methods", "functional hazard assessment", "model checking", "modern aircraft", "pitch guidance commands", "software intensive systems", "software safety analysis", "theorem proving", "vertical navigation function", "Aerospace control", "Aerospace electronics", "Aerospace safety", "Aircraft navigation", "Failure analysis", "Flexible manufacturing systems", "Logic", "Performance analysis", "Software safety", "Software systems", ""], "authors": ["A.

Depending on the available RF hardware and desired lowest detectable target RCS, pulses as short as 20 ns look feasible. Modern signal processing methods enable the detection of targets close to the noise limit. It seems, therefore, appropriate to discuss the relevance of using 3 dB beamwidths for clutter cell calculations. Experiments suggest that more accurate predictions are obtained by using 1 dB widths instead. The lack of comprehensive data for very small grazing angles and the less surveyed small-scale topography of radar environments set some constraints for straightforward implementations.

Historically, the US Air Force has desired to achieve an autonomous capability to maintain the equipment it uses. This has been achieved, traditionally, by setting-up three levels of maintenance: organizational; intermediate (back-shop); and depot. The I-level back-shops often utilize militarized automatic test equipment (ATE) and test program sets (TPSs) to test today's complex aircraft line replaceable units (LRUs). And even though this is still a cost-effective maintenance philosophy, it has become costly to develop militarized ATE. The Department of Defense (DoD) has been very active in trying to reduce the total ownership cost of ATE in the government inventory. One approach is to utilize commercial, instead of Mil-Spec, ATE. However, utilizing commercial ATE at an USAF back-shop is not without its tradeoffs and challenges as it represents a significant deviation from the way the USAF maintenance squadrons are accustomed to \"doing business.\" This paper documents the current success story of replacing the legacy C-17 I-level ATE with a commercial ATE.", "date_publication": "July 2004", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2004.1346846", "issue_date": "July 2004", "issue": "7", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8146094", "firstpage": "31"}, "keywords": ["aerospace test facilities", "aircraft maintenance", "automatic test equipment", "military aircraft", "Air Force I", "C-17 I-level ATE", "Department of Defense", "Mil-Spec", "US Air Force", "USAF maintenance squadron", "aircraft equipment maintenance", "aircraft line replaceable units", "aircraft repair facility", "automatic test equipment", "back-shop", "commercial ATE", "cost-effective maintenance", "depot maintenance", "intermediate maintenance", "militarized ATE", "militarized equipment", "organizational maintenance", "test program sets", "Aging", "Automatic test equipment", "Automatic testing", "Business", "Costs", "Documentation", "Government", "Military aircraft", "Procurement", "Weapons", ""], "authors": ["F.

Typical ICS long-cords are approximately 100 feet in length and allow crewmembers to maintain communications as they move about the aircraft while performing their mission duties. These cords also allow crewmembers to maintain communications with the aircraft when disembarked, as when they are controlling aircraft during engine start-up. Unfortunately, the current wired topology significantly reduces mission effectiveness, impedes crewmember movement, and greatly increases the crewmember's risk of injury. These drawbacks are more pronounced onboard military rotary winged aircraft (helicopters) where several crewmembers have been injured or killed during emergencies requiring the aircraft to ditch at sea. During ditching, crewmembers often became entangled in their lengthy ICS cord, preventing or delaying aircraft egress.

The narrow margin of victory can be ascribed to Britain's air-warning radar, Chain Home (CH), consisting of the 15-meter CH and the 1.5-meter CHL. The skillful use of this equipment by the Royal Air Force made daylight bombing unsustainable; the Luftwaffe then turned to night attacks, generally called \"The Blitz.\" These were not effective in destroying military and industrial targets and depended on the hope of reducing the population's will to fight. Chain Home was of little use except to observe the attackers arrival, as it had almost no ability to follow the attackers as they proceeded inland. This eventuality was reckoned with before the outbreak of hostilities and had called for radars mounted in night fighters capable of guiding the pilot close enough to the target for him to open fire visually. The electronic techniques used at 1.5-meters were adapted to planes capable of carrying the radar and its operator. But there were three important design constraints: 1) the antennas had to be restricted to sizes that were practical for installation on aircraft, which for meter waves gave them low gain and large side lobes; 2) the set's maximum range was limited by the fighter's altitude as a result of the huge ground returns from the side lobes. British antiaircraft artillery, the stepchild of their arms, was too ineffective to drive the bombers to extreme altitudes; and 3) a minimum range had to be held until the flier could see his target, which strained the pulse techniques of the time.", "date_publication": "July 2004", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2004.1346832", "issue_date": "July 2004", "issue": "7", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8146089", "firstpage": "3"}, "keywords": ["airborne radar", "military equipment", "military radar", "radar tracking", "target tracking", "1.5 m", "15 m", "British antiaircraft artillery", "Chain Home", "German Air Force", "Luftwaffe", "Royal Air Force", "The Blitz", "World War II", "air-warning radar", "airborne radar", "aircraft", "altitude", "antennas", "battles", "daylight bombing", "electronic techniques", "industrial target", "meter waves", "military target", "night attacks", "night fighters", "pulse techniques", "Aerospace electronics", "Airborne radar", "Aircraft", "Dipole antennas", "History", "Marine vehicles", "Physics", "Radar antennas", "Relays", "Yagi-Uda antennas", ""], "authors": ["L.

More than one study conducted at the Wright-Patterson large amplitude multi-mode aerospace research simulator (LAMARS) facility indicates that this is not necessarily true. Test pilots were able to compensate sufficiently to fly and meet defined performance standards on intentionally crippled aircraft flight control designs. These flight control systems were designed to trigger pilot-induced oscillations, but, in most cases, test pilots could compensate sufficiently to prevent pilot-induced oscillations and to control the simulated aircraft. Anecdotally, this points to a colossal deficiency in the test of highly augmented aircraft systems that has been borne out by multiple aircraft accidents in actual aircraft designs: natural pilot compensation is sufficient to allow faulty designs to reach production and operational service while hiding critical handling qualities cliffs that can lead to loss of an aircraft.

In order to perform accurate observation of vessel traffic without such efforts, the authors have developed a completely automated radar network system covering the main traffic route of Tokyo Bay. In August 2003, as the second remote radar station attaching AIS equipment was set at East Ogishima (the first was installed at the National Defense Academy in 2002), the observing range could be enlarged and cover most traffic routes in Tokyo Bay. These two radars can observe the vessel traffic in Tokyo Bay simultaneously so as to know the traffic flow accurately on the basis of analyzing the integrated radar data. In addition to the development of a radar network system, the software to analyze observed vessel traffic flow has been developed. This software has various functions such as tracking of ship's position, automatic determination of ship's size, animation of ship's movements, superposition of successive radar images, display of ship's tracks, calculation of ship's speed distribution, extraction of dangerous ship encounters using subjective judgment value and bumper model, etc. Some analyzed results on vessel traffic flow observed by the remote radars in January and September 2003 are shown in this paper.", "date_publication": "Nov. 2004", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2004.1365659", "issue_date": "Nov. 2004", "issue": "11", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8208170", "firstpage": "3"}, "keywords": ["marine radar", "marine systems", "radar computing", "radar imaging", "radar tracking", "traffic control", "AIS equipment", "East Ogishima", "Tokyo Bay", "automated radar network system", "bumper model", "integrated radar data", "port construction plan", "position tracking", "radar images", "radar observation systems", "remote radar station", "ship movement animation", "ship size determination", "speed distribution", "subjective judgment value", "vessel traffic flow", "vessel traffic management", "vessel traffic route design", "Animation", "Displays", "Joining processes", "Marine vehicles", "Radar equipment", "Radar imaging", "Radar tracking", "Software systems", "Telecommunication traffic", "Traffic control", ""], "authors": ["Shun Liu", "H.

A recent update of this system consisted of the replacement of an obsolete and very costly to maintain inertial navigation system. Another reason for updating the ship's inertial system was to provide higher accuracy attitude data, than was previously available with the old inertial system, to the high resolution multi-beam sonar system in order to produce improved bathymetric charts. After conducting a market survey of suitable inertial navigator systems, the Kearfott SEANAV ring laser gyro navigator (RLGN) system, using a monolithic T-24 gyro, was selected to replace the old inertial system. The selection of the SEANAV RLGN was based on its relatively low cost, high reliability, and, particularly, the roll and pitch data accuracies of typically less than 1-arc-minute. This attitude data accuracy was key to enable a significant improvement in the bathymetry data accuracy. Two SEANAV systems were integrated with GPS receivers, a system master time code generator, and electro magnetic (EM) log and Doppler sonar speed sensors to provide the navigation portion of the mapping data. Operational testing of this updated system aboard HMS SCOTT, in November, 2003, showed a marked improvement in the quality of the map product due, in part, to the improved attitude data provided by the SEANAV RLGN system.", "date_publication": "Nov. 2004", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2004.1365661", "issue_date": "Nov. 2004", "issue": "11", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8208172", "firstpage": "18"}, "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "bathymetry", "gyroscopes", "inertial navigation", "oceanographic techniques", "ring lasers", "sonar", "Doppler sonar speed sensors", "GPS receivers", "HMS SCOTT", "Kearfott SEANAV ring laser gyro navigator system", "San Diego", "Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center", "United Kingdom", "attitude data", "bathymetric charts", "deep ocean mapping system", "electro magnetic log", "inertial navigation system", "monolithic T-24 gyro", "multibeam sonar system", "ocean survey vessel", "ring laser gyro navigator integration", "time code generator", "Costs", "Global Positioning System", "Inertial navigation", "Magnetic sensors", "Oceanographic techniques", "Oceans", "Ring lasers", "Sensor systems", "Sonar navigation", "System testing", ""], "authors": ["M.

Moreover, this evaluation examined the influence of variations in illumination levels on the performance of a face recognition algorithm, specifically testing the significance between verification attempts and enrollment conditions with respect to factors of age, gender, ethnicity, facial characteristics, and facial obstructions. The results of this evaluation showed that for low and medium illuminance enrollments, there was a statistically significant difference between verification attempts made at low, medium, and high illuminance.

This point was recently highlighted in the Secretary of Defense's testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Referring to mission critical shortfalls that occurred during the IRAQ deployment, the Secretary discussed the state of the current warfighting environment (Rumsfeld and Franks, 2003). Although tremendous progress has been made in the integration of new and emerging technologies and their applications on the battlefield, there is still a significant lack of interoperability between various communication systems. To address these battlespace management environment issues, Raytheon Technical Services Company's Engineering and Production Support facility underwent a product development effort to provide a network centric interoperability demonstration for CAS. This demonstration utilized various Raytheon-fielded SA and CAS products in a representative CAS scenario interfacing to variable message format (VMF) based data links. This paper addresses the systems and software issues encountered during this successful demonstration of CAS battlespace connectivity. This presentation will also discuss lessons learned during our product development from both a systems and a software engineering perspective.", "date_publication": "Sept. 2004", "doi": "10.1109/MAES.2004.1346919", "issue_date": "Sept. 2004", "issue": "9", "publisher": "IEEE", "inspec": "8164134", "firstpage": "8"}, "keywords": ["data communication", "military communication", "mobile communication", "open systems", "telecommunication computing", "telecommunication network management", "Afghanistan", "Engineering and Production Support facility", "Iraq", "Network Centric Warfare infrastructure", "Raytheon Technical Services Company", "Secretary of Defense", "Senate Armed Services Committee", "battlespace management environment", "close air support", "communication systems", "data link", "military deployments", "network centric interoperability", "situational awareness", "software engineering", "systems engineering", "variable message format", "warfighting environment", "Content addressable storage", "Engineering management", "Environmental management", "Hardware", "Mission critical systems", "Portable computers", "Product development", "Production", "Software systems", "Testing", ""], "authors": ["D.
